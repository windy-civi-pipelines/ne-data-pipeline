legislative purposes contained in section 2 of this act.
(8) If the application is approved by the Tax Commissioner, the qualified
employer and the state shall enter into a written agreement, which shall be
executed on behalf of the state by the Tax Commissioner. In the agreement, the
qualified employer shall agree to maintain the required level of employment and
make the required wage increases, and in consideration of the qualified
employer's agreement, the state shall agree to allow the wage credits as
provided in the Defense Efforts Workforce Act. The application, and all
supporting documentation, to the extent approved, shall be considered a part of
the agreement. The agreement may contain such terms and conditions as the Tax
Commissioner specifies in order to carry out the legislative purposes of the
Defense Efforts Workforce Act. The agreement shall contain provisions to allow
the Tax Commissioner to verify that the required levels of employment have been
maintained and the appropriate increases in wages have been made.
Sec. 17. (1) If the taxpayer fails to maintain the required level of
employment and meet the wage requirements through the entire performance
period, all or a portion of the wage credits shall be recaptured directly by
the state from the taxpayer or shall be disallowed. In no event shall any wage
credits be required to be paid back directly or indirectly by the employees.
All such credits must be repaid by the taxpayer.
(2) The recapture or disallowance shall be as follows:
(a) No wage credits shall be allowed, and if already allowed shall be
recaptured, for the actual year or years in which the required level of
employment was not maintained or the wage requirement was not met;
(b) For wage credits allowed in prior years, one-tenth of the credits
shall be recaptured from the taxpayer for each year the required level of
employment was not maintained or the wage requirement was not met; and

-2-

the wage requirement was not met in previous years.
(3) Any amounts required to be recaptured shall be deemed to be an
underpayment of tax, immediately due and payable, and shall constitute a lien
on the assets of the taxpayer. When wage credits were received in more than one
year, the credits received in the most recent year shall be recovered first and
then the credits received in earlier years shall be recovered up to the extent
of the required recapture.
(4) Interest shall accrue from the due date for the return for the year in
which the taxpayer failed to maintain the required level of employment or meet
the required wage level.
(5) Penalties shall not accrue until ninety days after the requirement for
recapture or disallowance becomes known or should have become known to the
taxpayer.
(6) The recapture or disallowance required by this section may be waived
by the Tax Commissioner if he or she finds the failure to maintain the required
level of employment or meet the required wage level was caused by unavoidable
circumstances such as an act of God or a national emergency.
Sec. 18. (1) The wage credits allowed under the Defense Efforts Workforce
Act shall not be transferable except in the following situations:

Section 3:
section 521 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a limited
cooperative association, or an estate or trust may be distributed to the
partners, members, shareholders, patrons, or beneficiaries in the same manner
as income is distributed for use against their income tax liabilities, and such
partners, members, shareholders, or beneficiaries shall be deemed to have made
an underpayment of their income taxes for any recapture required by section 17
of this act. A credit distributed shall be considered a credit used and the
partnership, limited liability company, subchapter S corporation, cooperative,
including a cooperative exempt under section 521 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, limited cooperative association, estate, or trust shall be
liable for any repayment required by section 17 of this act; and
(b) The credits previously allowed and future credits may be transferred
when an agreement is transferred in its entirety by sale or lease to another
taxpayer or in an acquisition of assets qualifying under section 381 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

the distribution of the credit or any remaining carryover with the initial
fiduciary return filed for the estate. The determination of the distribution of
the credit may be changed only after obtaining the permission of the Tax
Commissioner.

taxpayer about the agreement and prior credits that is reasonably necessary to

report shall be on a fiscal year, accrual basis that satisfies the requirements
set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The Department of Revenue
shall, on or before December 15 of each year, appear at a joint hearing of the
Appropriations Committee of the Legislature and the Revenue Committee of the
Legislature and present the report. Any supplemental information requested by
three or more committee members must be provided within thirty days after the
request.
(2) The report shall list (a) the agreements which have been signed during
the previous calendar year, (b) the agreements which are still in effect, and
(c) the identity of each taxpayer that is a party to an agreement.

preceding two years, expressed as a single, aggregated total. The information
required to be reported under this subsection shall not be reported for the
first year the taxpayer maintains the required employment threshold. The
information on first-year credits used shall be combined with and reported as
part of the second year. Thereafter, the information on credits used for
succeeding years shall be reported for each agreement every two years
containing information on two years of credits used.
(4) No information shall be provided in the report that is protected by
