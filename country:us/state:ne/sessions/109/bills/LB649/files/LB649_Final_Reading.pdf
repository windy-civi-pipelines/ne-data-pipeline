1 Sec. 15. (1) If a qualified employer has entered into an agreement
2 with the state pursuant to section 16 of this act, the qualified employer
3 shall during each year of the performance period receive the wage credit
4 approved by the Tax Commissioner in the manner provided in the Defense
5 Efforts Workforce Act.
6 (2) The wage credit shall equal five percent of the total
7 compensation paid by the qualified employer in the year to all qualified
8 employees of the qualified employer in Nebraska. The wage credit earned

10 year. If two or more qualified employers qualify for benefits in any

16 pursuant to the Defense Efforts Workforce Act shall not exceed forty
17 million dollars. If two or more qualified employers qualify for benefits,

1 (6) The Tax Commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing as to
2 whether the application has been approved or not. The Tax Commissioner
3 shall decide and mail the notice within thirty days after receiving the
4 application, regardless of whether he or she approves or disapproves the
5 application, unless the time is extended by mutual written consent of the
6 Tax Commissioner and the applicant.
7 (7) An application may be approved only if it is consistent with the
8 legislative purposes contained in section 2 of this act.
9 (8) If the application is approved by the Tax Commissioner, the
10 qualified employer and the state shall enter into a written agreement,
11 which shall be executed on behalf of the state by the Tax Commissioner.
12 In the agreement, the qualified employer shall agree to maintain the
13 required level of employment and make the required wage increases, and in
14 consideration of the qualified employer's agreement, the state shall
15 agree to allow the wage credits as provided in the Defense Efforts
16 Workforce Act. The application, and all supporting documentation, to the
17 extent approved, shall be considered a part of the agreement. The
18 agreement may contain such terms and conditions as the Tax Commissioner
19 specifies in order to carry out the legislative purposes of the Defense
20 Efforts Workforce Act. The agreement shall contain provisions to allow
21 the Tax Commissioner to verify that the required levels of employment
22 have been maintained and the appropriate increases in wages have been
23 made.
24 Sec. 17. (1) If the taxpayer fails to maintain the required level
25 of employment and meet the wage requirements through the entire
26 performance period, all or a portion of the wage credits shall be
27 recaptured directly by the state from the taxpayer or shall be
28 disallowed. In no event shall any wage credits be required to be paid
29 back directly or indirectly by the employees. All such credits must be
30 repaid by the taxpayer.
31 (2) The recapture or disallowance shall be as follows:
-6-

LB649 LB649
2025 2025
1 (a) No wage credits shall be allowed, and if already allowed shall
2 be recaptured, for the actual year or years in which the required level
3 of employment was not maintained or the wage requirement was not met;
4 (b) For wage credits allowed in prior years, one-tenth of the
5 credits shall be recaptured from the taxpayer for each year the required
6 level of employment was not maintained or the wage requirement was not
7 met; and
8 (c) For wage credits for future years, one-tenth of the credits
9 shall be disallowed for each year the required level of employment was
10 not maintained or the wage requirement was not met in previous years.
11 (3) Any amounts required to be recaptured shall be deemed to be an
12 underpayment of tax, immediately due and payable, and shall constitute a
13 lien on the assets of the taxpayer. When wage credits were received in
14 more than one year, the credits received in the most recent year shall be
15 recovered first and then the credits received in earlier years shall be
16 recovered up to the extent of the required recapture.
17 (4) Interest shall accrue from the due date for the return for the
18 year in which the taxpayer failed to maintain the required level of
19 employment or meet the required wage level.
20 (5) Penalties shall not accrue until ninety days after the
21 requirement for recapture or disallowance becomes known or should have
22 become known to the taxpayer.
23 (6) The recapture or disallowance required by this section may be
24 waived by the Tax Commissioner if he or she finds the failure to maintain
25 the required level of employment or meet the required wage level was
26 caused by unavoidable circumstances such as an act of God or a national
27 emergency.
28 Sec. 18. (1) The wage credits allowed under the Defense Efforts
29 Workforce Act shall not be transferable except in the following
30 situations:
31 (a) Any credit allowable to a partnership, a limited liability

1 company, a subchapter S corporation, a cooperative, including a
2 cooperative exempt under section 521 of the Internal Revenue Code of
3 1986, as amended, a limited cooperative association, or an estate or
4 trust may be distributed to the partners, members, shareholders, patrons,
5 or beneficiaries in the same manner as income is distributed for use
6 against their income tax liabilities, and such partners, members,
7 shareholders, or beneficiaries shall be deemed to have made an
8 underpayment of their income taxes for any recapture required by section
9 17 of this act. A credit distributed shall be considered a credit used
10 and the partnership, limited liability company, subchapter S corporation,
11 cooperative, including a cooperative exempt under section 521 of the
12 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limited cooperative
13 association, estate, or trust shall be liable for any repayment required
14 by section 17 of this act; and
15 (b) The credits previously allowed and future credits may be
16 transferred when an agreement is transferred in its entirety by sale or
17 lease to another taxpayer or in an acquisition of assets qualifying under
18 section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
19 (2) The acquiring taxpayer, as of the date of notification to the
20 Tax Commissioner of the completed transfer, shall be entitled to any
21 unused credits and to any future credits allowable under the Defense
22 Efforts Workforce Act.
23 (3) The acquiring taxpayer shall be liable for any recapture that
24 becomes due after the date of the transfer for the repayment of any
25 credits received either before or after the transfer.
26 (4) If a taxpayer dies and there is a credit remaining after the
27 filing of the final return for the taxpayer, the personal representative
28 shall determine the distribution of the credit or any remaining carryover
29 with the initial fiduciary return filed for the estate. The determination
30 of the distribution of the credit may be changed only after obtaining the
31 permission of the Tax Commissioner.

3 necessary to determine the future credits and liabilities of the
4 taxpayer.
5 Sec. 19. The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and
6 regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the
7 Defense Efforts Workforce Act.
8 Sec. 20. (1) The Department of Revenue shall submit electronically
9 an annual report to the Legislature no later than October 31 of each

12 Department of Revenue shall, on or before December 15 of each year,
13 appear at a joint hearing of the Appropriations Committee of the
14 Legislature and the Revenue Committee of the Legislature and present the
15 report. Any supplemental information requested by three or more committee
16 members must be provided within thirty days after the request.
17 (2) The report shall list (a) the agreements which have been signed
18 during the previous calendar year, (b) the agreements which are still in
19 effect, and (c) the identity of each taxpayer that is a party to an
20 agreement.
21 (3) The report shall provide information on agreement-specific total
22 credits used every two years for each agreement. The report shall
23 disclose the identity of the taxpayer and the total credits used during
24 the immediately preceding two years, expressed as a single, aggregated
25 total. The information required to be reported under this subsection
26 shall not be reported for the first year the taxpayer maintains the
27 required employment threshold. The information on first-year credits used
28 shall be combined with and reported as part of the second year.
29 Thereafter, the information on credits used for succeeding years shall be
30 reported for each agreement every two years containing information on two
31 years of credits used.
