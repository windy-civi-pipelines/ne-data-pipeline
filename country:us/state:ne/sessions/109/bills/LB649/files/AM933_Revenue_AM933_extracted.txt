1 (2) The recapture or disallowance shall be as follows:

28 emergency.

5 trust may be distributed to the partners, members, shareholders, patrons,
6 or beneficiaries in the same manner as income is distributed for use
7 against their income tax liabilities, and such partners, members,
8 shareholders, or beneficiaries shall be deemed to have made an
9 underpayment of their income taxes for any recapture required by section

25 on the date submitted for the purposes of the Defense Efforts Workforce
26 Act.
27 (4) The application and all supporting information are confidential
28 except for the name of the taxpayer, the number of qualified employees,
29 and whether the application has been approved.
30 (5) The Tax Commissioner shall determine whether to approve the
31 application based upon whether the applicant meets the definition of a
-4-

1 qualified employer.
2 (6) The Tax Commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing as to
3 whether the application has been approved or not. The Tax Commissioner
4 shall decide and mail the notice within thirty days after receiving the
5 application, regardless of whether he or she approves or disapproves the
6 application, unless the time is extended by mutual written consent of the
7 Tax Commissioner and the applicant.
8 (7) An application may be approved only if it is consistent with the
9 legislative purposes contained in section 2 of this act.
10 (8) If the application is approved by the Tax Commissioner, the
11 qualified employer and the state shall enter into a written agreement,
12 which shall be executed on behalf of the state by the Tax Commissioner.
13 In the agreement, the qualified employer shall agree to maintain the
14 required level of employment and make the required wage increases, and in
15 consideration of the qualified employer's agreement, the state shall
16 agree to allow the wage credits as provided in the Defense Efforts
17 Workforce Act. The application, and all supporting documentation, to the
18 extent approved, shall be considered a part of the agreement. The
19 agreement may contain such terms and conditions as the Tax Commissioner
20 specifies in order to carry out the legislative purposes of the Defense
21 Efforts Workforce Act. The agreement shall contain provisions to allow
22 the Tax Commissioner to verify that the required levels of employment
23 have been maintained and the appropriate increases in wages have been
24 made.
25 Sec. 16. (1) If the taxpayer fails to maintain the required level
26 of employment and meet the wage requirements through the entire
27 performance period, all or a portion of the wage credits shall be
28 recaptured directly by the state from the taxpayer or shall be
29 disallowed. In no event shall any wage credits be required to be paid
30 back directly or indirectly by the employees. All such credits must be
31 repaid by the taxpayer.

1 (2) The recapture or disallowance shall be as follows:
2 (a) No wage credits shall be allowed, and if already allowed shall
3 be recaptured, for the actual year or years in which the required level
4 of employment was not maintained or the wage requirement was not met;
5 (b) For wage credits allowed in prior years, one-tenth of the
6 credits shall be recaptured from the taxpayer for each year the required
7 level of employment was not maintained or the wage requirement was not
8 met; and
9 (c) For wage credits for future years, one-tenth of the credits
10 shall be disallowed for each year the required level of employment was
11 not maintained or the wage requirement was not met in previous years.
12 (3) Any amounts required to be recaptured shall be deemed to be an
13 underpayment of tax, immediately due and payable, and shall constitute a
14 lien on the assets of the taxpayer. When wage credits were received in
15 more than one year, the credits received in the most recent year shall be
16 recovered first and then the credits received in earlier years shall be
17 recovered up to the extent of the required recapture.
18 (4) Interest shall accrue from the due date for the return for the
19 year in which the taxpayer failed to maintain the required level of
20 employment or meet the required wage level.
21 (5) Penalties shall not accrue until ninety days after the
22 requirement for recapture or disallowance becomes known or should have
23 become known to the taxpayer.
24 (6) The recapture or disallowance required by this section may be
25 waived by the Tax Commissioner if he or she finds the failure to maintain
26 the required level of employment or meet the required wage level was
27 caused by unavoidable circumstances such as an act of God or a national
28 emergency.
29 Sec. 17. (1) The wage credits allowed under the Defense Efforts
30 Workforce Act shall not be transferable except in the following
31 situations:

2 company, a subchapter S corporation, a cooperative, including a
3 cooperative exempt under section 521 of the Internal Revenue Code of
4 1986, as amended, a limited cooperative association, or an estate or
5 trust may be distributed to the partners, members, shareholders, patrons,
6 or beneficiaries in the same manner as income is distributed for use
7 against their income tax liabilities, and such partners, members,
8 shareholders, or beneficiaries shall be deemed to have made an
9 underpayment of their income taxes for any recapture required by section
10 16 of this act. A credit distributed shall be considered a credit used
11 and the partnership, limited liability company, subchapter S corporation,
12 cooperative, including a cooperative exempt under section 521 of the
13 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limited cooperative
14 association, estate, or trust shall be liable for any repayment required
15 by section 16 of this act; and
16 (b) The credits previously allowed and future credits may be
17 transferred when an agreement is transferred in its entirety by sale or
18 lease to another taxpayer or in an acquisition of assets qualifying under
19 section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
20 (2) The acquiring taxpayer, as of the date of notification to the
21 Tax Commissioner of the completed transfer, shall be entitled to any
22 unused credits and to any future credits allowable under the Defense
23 Efforts Workforce Act.
24 (3) The acquiring taxpayer shall be liable for any recapture that
25 becomes due after the date of the transfer for the repayment of any
26 credits received either before or after the transfer.
27 (4) If a taxpayer dies and there is a credit remaining after the
28 filing of the final return for the taxpayer, the personal representative
29 shall determine the distribution of the credit or any remaining carryover
30 with the initial fiduciary return filed for the estate. The determination
31 of the distribution of the credit may be changed only after obtaining the

12 the requirements set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The
13 Department of Revenue shall, on or before December 15 of each year,
14 appear at a joint hearing of the Appropriations Committee of the
15 Legislature and the Revenue Committee of the Legislature and present the
16 report. Any supplemental information requested by three or more committee
17 members must be provided within thirty days after the request.
18 (2) The report shall list (a) the agreements which have been signed
19 during the previous calendar year, (b) the agreements which are still in
20 effect, and (c) the identity of each taxpayer that is a party to an
21 agreement.
22 (3) The report shall provide information on agreement-specific total
23 credits used every two years for each agreement. The report shall
24 disclose the identity of the taxpayer and the total credits used during
25 the immediately preceding two years, expressed as a single, aggregated
26 total. The information required to be reported under this subsection
27 shall not be reported for the first year the taxpayer maintains the
28 required employment threshold. The information on first-year credits used
29 shall be combined with and reported as part of the second year.
30 Thereafter, the information on credits used for succeeding years shall be
31 reported for each agreement every two years containing information on two
