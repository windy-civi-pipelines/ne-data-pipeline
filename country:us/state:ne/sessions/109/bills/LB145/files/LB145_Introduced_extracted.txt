1 under this subsection. Priority shall be given to grant applicants whose
2 proposed programs are consistent with vegetation management goals and
3 priorities and plans and policies of the Riparian Vegetation Management
4 Task Force established under section 2-970. Beginning in fiscal year
5 2025-26 2022-23, it is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate six
6 three million dollars annually for the management of vegetation within
7 the banks or flood plain of a natural stream. Such funds shall only be

9 programs that have as their primary objective improving conveyance of
10 streamflow in natural streams. Grants from funds appropriated as provided
11 in this subsection shall be disbursed only to weed management entities,
12 local weed control authorities, and natural resources districts whose
13 territory includes river basins, with priority given to river basins that
14 are the subject of an interstate compact or decree. The Game and Parks
15 Commission shall assist grant recipients in implementing grant projects
16 under this subsection, and interlocal agreements under the Interlocal
17 Cooperation Act or the Joint Public Agency Act shall be utilized whenever
18 possible in carrying out the grant projects.
19 (5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve control
20 authorities of their duties and responsibilities under the Noxious Weed
21 Control Act or the duty of a person to control the spread of noxious
22 weeds on lands owned and controlled by him or her.
23 (6) The Department of Agriculture may adopt and promulgate necessary
24 rules and regulations to carry out this section.
25 (7) The director may annually apply for conservation funding from
26 the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States
27 Department of Agriculture.
