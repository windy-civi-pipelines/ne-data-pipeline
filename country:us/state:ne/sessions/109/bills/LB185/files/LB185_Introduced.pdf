2025 2025
1 document may be delivered by electronic means only if the method used

21 tenant or landlord is effective within a reasonable period of time after
22 receipt of the withdrawal by the other party. Failure by a landlord to
23 comply with subdivision (7)(d) of this section may be treated, at the
24 election of the tenant, as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this
25 section.
26 (13) The changes made to this section by this legislative bill do
27 not apply to a notice or document delivered by electronic means before
28 the effective date of this act to a tenant or landlord who, before such
29 date, consented to receive notices or documents by electronic means.

9 documents delivered by electronic means without the imposition of any
10 condition or consequence that was not disclosed at the time of initial

13 other delivery method permitted by law other than electronic means if:
