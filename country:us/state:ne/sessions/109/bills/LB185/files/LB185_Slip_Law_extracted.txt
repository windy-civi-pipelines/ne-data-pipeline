-2-
LB185 LB185
2025 2025
by electronic means and such change creates a material risk that the tenant
will not be able to access or retain a subsequent notice or document to which
the consent applies, the landlord:
(i) Provides the tenant with a statement that describes:
(A) The revised hardware and software requirements for access to and
retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means; and
(B) The right of the tenant to withdraw consent without the imposition of
any condition or consequence; and
(ii) Complies with subdivision (7)(b) of this section.

of entering into or renewing a rental agreement, require a tenant to accept
delivery by electronic means.
(10) This section does not affect any requirement related to the content
or timing of any notice or document required under applicable law.
(11)(a) If any provision of the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant
Act or any other applicable law requiring a notice or document to be provided

receipt of the notice or document, the notice or document may be delivered by
electronic means only if the method used provides for verification or
acknowledgment of receipt.
(b)(i) For a notice or document sent by a landlord to a tenant, if
verification or acknowledgment of receipt is not obtained, the notice or
document shall be sent to the tenant by mail as prescribed by the Uniform
Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. If two or more electronic communications
to the tenant are returned as undeliverable during a thirty-day period, all
future communications shall be sent to the tenant by first-class or other mail
as prescribed by law unless and until the tenant consents electronically, or
confirms electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the
tenant can access information in the electronic form that will be used for
notices or documents delivered by electronic means as to which the tenant has
given consent.
(ii) For a notice or document sent by a tenant to a landlord, if
verification or acknowledgment of receipt is not obtained, the tenant shall
send the notice or document by any other means prescribed by law.
(12) A withdrawal of consent by a tenant or landlord does not affect the
legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of a notice or document
delivered by electronic means to the tenant or landlord before the withdrawal
of consent is effective. A withdrawal of consent by a tenant or landlord is
effective within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the withdrawal by
the other party. Failure by a landlord to comply with subdivision (7)(d) of
this section may be treated, at the election of the tenant, as a withdrawal of
consent for purposes of this section.
(13) The changes made to this section by this legislative bill do not
apply to a notice or document delivered by electronic means before the
effective date of this act to a tenant or landlord who, before such date,
consented to receive notices or documents by electronic means.
(14) If the consent of a tenant to receive certain notices or documents by
delivery by electronic means is on file with a landlord before the effective
date of this act, and pursuant to this section a landlord intends to deliver by
electronic means additional notices or documents to such tenant, then prior to
delivering such additional notices or documents by electronic means, the
landlord shall provide the tenant with a statement that describes:
(a) The notices or documents that will be delivered by electronic means
that were not previously delivered electronically; and
(b) The tenant's right to withdraw consent to have notices or documents
delivered by electronic means without the imposition of any condition or
consequence.
(15) A landlord or tenant shall deliver a notice or document by any other
delivery method permitted by law other than electronic means if:
(a) The landlord or tenant attempts to deliver the notice or document by
electronic means and has a reasonable basis for believing that the notice or
document has not been received by the other party; or
(b) The landlord or tenant becomes aware that the electronic mail address
provided by the other party is no longer valid.
(16) This section shall not be construed to modify, limit, or supersede
the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15
U.S.C. 7001 et seq., as such act existed on January 1, 2025.

(6) Delivery of a notice or document by electronic means in accordance

(7) A notice or document may be delivered by electronic means by a
landlord to a tenant under this section if:
(a) The tenant has affirmatively consented to such method of delivery and

(b) The tenant, before giving consent, is provided with a clear and

software requirements needed to access or retain a notice or document delivered
-2-

LB185 LB185
2025 2025
by electronic means and such change creates a material risk that the tenant
will not be able to access or retain a subsequent notice or document to which
the consent applies, the landlord:
(i) Provides the tenant with a statement that describes:
(A) The revised hardware and software requirements for access to and
retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means; and
(B) The right of the tenant to withdraw consent without the imposition of
any condition or consequence; and
(ii) Complies with subdivision (7)(b) of this section.

acknowledgment of receipt.

Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. If two or more electronic communications
to the tenant are returned as undeliverable during a thirty-day period, all
future communications shall be sent to the tenant by first-class or other mail

tenant can access information in the electronic form that will be used for
notices or documents delivered by electronic means as to which the tenant has
given consent.
(ii) For a notice or document sent by a tenant to a landlord, if
verification or acknowledgment of receipt is not obtained, the tenant shall
send the notice or document by any other means prescribed by law.
(12) A withdrawal of consent by a tenant or landlord does not affect the
legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of a notice or document
delivered by electronic means to the tenant or landlord before the withdrawal
of consent is effective. A withdrawal of consent by a tenant or landlord is
effective within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the withdrawal by
the other party. Failure by a landlord to comply with subdivision (7)(d) of
this section may be treated, at the election of the tenant, as a withdrawal of
consent for purposes of this section.

apply to a notice or document delivered by electronic means before the
effective date of this act to a tenant or landlord who, before such date,
consented to receive notices or documents by electronic means.

delivery by electronic means is on file with a landlord before the effective
date of this act, and pursuant to this section a landlord intends to deliver by
electronic means additional notices or documents to such tenant, then prior to
delivering such additional notices or documents by electronic means, the
landlord shall provide the tenant with a statement that describes:

delivered by electronic means without the imposition of any condition or
consequence.

delivery method permitted by law other than electronic means if:

electronic means and has a reasonable basis for believing that the notice or
document has not been received by the other party; or
(b) The landlord or tenant becomes aware that the electronic mail address
provided by the other party is no longer valid.
(16) This section shall not be construed to modify, limit, or supersede
the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15
U.S.C. 7001 et seq., as such act existed on January 1, 2025.
