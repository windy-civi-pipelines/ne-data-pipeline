5 communications to the tenant are returned as undeliverable during a
6 thirty-day period, all future communications shall be sent to the tenant
7 by first-class or other mail as prescribed by law unless and until the

19 tenant or landlord is effective within a reasonable period of time after
20 receipt of the withdrawal by the other party. Failure by a landlord to
21 comply with subdivision (7)(d) of this section may be treated, at the
22 election of the tenant, as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this
23 section.
24 (13) The changes made to this section by this legislative bill do
25 not apply to a notice or document delivered by electronic means before
26 the effective date of this act to a tenant or landlord who, before such

3 information in the electronic form that will be used for notices or

24 content or timing of any notice or document required under applicable
25 law.
26 (11)(a) If any provision of the Uniform Residential Landlord and
27 Tenant Act or any other applicable law requiring a notice or document to

29 acknowledgment of receipt of the notice or document, the notice or
30 document may be delivered by electronic means only if the method used
31 provides for verification or acknowledgment of receipt.
-7-

LB185 LB185
2025 2025
1 (b)(i) For a notice or document sent by a landlord to a tenant, if
2 verification or acknowledgment of receipt is not obtained, the notice or
3 document shall be sent to the tenant by mail as prescribed by the Uniform
4 Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. If two or more electronic
5 communications to the tenant are returned as undeliverable during a
6 thirty-day period, all future communications shall be sent to the tenant
7 by first-class or other mail as prescribed by law unless and until the
8 tenant consents electronically, or confirms electronically, in a manner
9 that reasonably demonstrates that the tenant can access information in
10 the electronic form that will be used for notices or documents delivered
11 by electronic means as to which the tenant has given consent.
12 (ii) For a notice or document sent by a tenant to a landlord, if
13 verification or acknowledgment of receipt is not obtained, the tenant
14 shall send the notice or document by any other means prescribed by law.
15 (12) A withdrawal of consent by a tenant or landlord does not affect
16 the legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of a notice or
17 document delivered by electronic means to the tenant or landlord before
18 the withdrawal of consent is effective. A withdrawal of consent by a
19 tenant or landlord is effective within a reasonable period of time after
20 receipt of the withdrawal by the other party. Failure by a landlord to
21 comply with subdivision (7)(d) of this section may be treated, at the
22 election of the tenant, as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this
23 section.
24 (13) The changes made to this section by this legislative bill do
25 not apply to a notice or document delivered by electronic means before
26 the effective date of this act to a tenant or landlord who, before such
27 date, consented to receive notices or documents by electronic means.
28 (14) If the consent of a tenant to receive certain notices or
29 documents by delivery by electronic means is on file with a landlord
30 before the effective date of this act, and pursuant to this section a
31 landlord intends to deliver by electronic means additional notices or
-8-

LB185 LB185
2025 2025
1 documents to such tenant, then prior to delivering such additional
2 notices or documents by electronic means, the landlord shall provide the
3 tenant with a statement that describes:
4 (a) The notices or documents that will be delivered by electronic
5 means that were not previously delivered electronically; and
6 (b) The tenant's right to withdraw consent to have notices or
7 documents delivered by electronic means without the imposition of any
8 condition or consequence.
9 (15) A landlord or tenant shall deliver a notice or document by any
10 other delivery method permitted by law other than electronic means if:
11 (a) The landlord or tenant attempts to deliver the notice or
12 document by electronic means and has a reasonable basis for believing
13 that the notice or document has not been received by the other party; or
14 (b) The landlord or tenant becomes aware that the electronic mail
15 address provided by the other party is no longer valid.
16 (16) This section shall not be construed to modify, limit, or
17 supersede the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
18 Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., as such act existed on January 1,
19 2025.
20 Sec. 3. Section 76-1450, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 76-1450 Sections 76-1450 to 76-14,111 and section 5 of this act
23 shall be known and may be cited as the Mobile Home Landlord and Tenant
24 Act.
25 Sec. 4. Section 76-1457, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 76-1457 As used in the Mobile Home Landlord and Tenant Act, unless
28 the context otherwise requires, the definitions found in sections 76-1458
29 to 76-1471 and section 5 of this act shall apply.

31 document to be provided by or to a landlord or tenant, includes a notice

4 (i) The right of the tenant to withdraw consent to have a notice or
5 document delivered by electronic means at any time without the imposition
6 of any conditions or consequences;
7 (ii) The transactions and types of notices and documents to which
8 the tenant's consent would apply;
9 (iii) The right of a tenant to have a notice or document delivered
10 in paper form by mail and the means, after consent is given, by which a
11 tenant may obtain a paper copy of a notice or document delivered by
12 electronic means; and
13 (iv) The procedure a tenant shall follow to withdraw consent to have
14 a notice or document delivered by electronic means or to update the
15 tenant's electronic mail address;
16 (c) The tenant:
17 (i) Before giving consent, is provided with a statement of the
18 hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a
19 notice or document delivered by electronic means; and
20 (ii) Consents electronically, or confirms consent electronically, in
21 a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the tenant can access
22 information in the electronic form that will be used for notices or
23 documents delivered by electronic means as to which the tenant has given
24 consent; and
25 (d) After the tenant consents, if there is a change in the hardware
26 or software requirements needed to access or retain a notice or document
27 delivered by electronic means and such change creates a material risk
28 that the tenant will not be able to access or retain a subsequent notice
29 or document to which the consent applies, the landlord:
30 (i) Provides the tenant with a statement that describes:
31 (A) The revised hardware and software requirements for access to and

1 retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means; and
2 (B) The right of the tenant to withdraw consent without the
3 imposition of any condition or consequence; and
4 (ii) Complies with subdivision (7)(b) of this section.
5 (8) A notice or document may be delivered by electronic means by a
6 tenant to a landlord under this section if the landlord has consented to
7 delivery by electronic means with respect to such tenant.
8 (9) A landlord shall not, as part of a rental agreement or as a
9 condition of entering into or renewing a rental agreement, require a
10 tenant to accept delivery by electronic means.
11 (10) This section does not affect any requirement related to the
12 content or timing of any notice or document required under applicable
13 law.
14 (11)(a) If any provision of the Mobile Home Landlord and Tenant Act
15 or any other applicable law requiring a notice or document to be provided
16 to a tenant or landlord expressly requires verification or acknowledgment
17 of receipt of the notice or document, the notice or document may be
18 delivered by electronic means only if the method used provides for
19 verification or acknowledgment of receipt.
20 (b)(i) For a notice or document sent by a landlord to a tenant, if
21 verification or acknowledgment of receipt is not obtained, the notice or
22 document shall be sent to the tenant by mail as prescribed by the Mobile
23 Home Landlord and Tenant Act. If two or more electronic communications to
24 the tenant are returned as undeliverable during a thirty-day period, all
25 future communications shall be sent to the tenant by first-class or other
26 mail as prescribed by law unless and until the tenant consents
27 electronically, or confirms electronically, in a manner that reasonably
28 demonstrates that the tenant can access information in the electronic
29 form that will be used for notices or documents delivered by electronic
30 means as to which the tenant has given consent.
31 (ii) For a notice or document sent by a tenant to a landlord, if
-13-

LB185 LB185
2025 2025
1 verification or acknowledgment of receipt is not obtained, the tenant
2 shall send the notice or document by any other means prescribed by law.
3 (12) A withdrawal of consent by a tenant or landlord does not affect
4 the legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of a notice or
5 document delivered by electronic means to the tenant or landlord before
6 the withdrawal of consent is effective. A withdrawal of consent by a
7 tenant or landlord is effective within a reasonable period of time after
8 receipt of the withdrawal by the other party. Failure by a landlord to
9 comply with subdivision (7)(d) of this section may be treated, at the
10 election of the tenant, as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this
11 section.
12 (13) The changes made to this section by this legislative bill do
13 not apply to a notice or document delivered by electronic means before
14 the effective date of this act to a tenant or landlord who, before such
15 date, consented to receive notices or documents by electronic means.
16 (14) If the consent of a tenant to receive certain notices or
17 documents by delivery by electronic means is on file with a landlord
18 before the effective date of this act, and pursuant to this section a
19 landlord intends to deliver by electronic means additional notices or
20 documents to such tenant, then prior to delivering such additional
21 notices or documents by electronic means, the landlord shall provide the
22 tenant with a statement that describes:
23 (a) The notices or documents that will be delivered by electronic
24 means that were not previously delivered electronically; and
25 (b) The tenant's right to withdraw consent to have notices or
26 documents delivered by electronic means without the imposition of any
27 condition or consequence.
28 (15) A landlord or tenant shall deliver a notice or document by any
29 other delivery method permitted by law other than electronic means if:
30 (a) The landlord or tenant attempts to deliver the notice or
31 document by electronic means and has a reasonable basis for believing
-14-

LB185 LB185
2025 2025
1 that the notice or document has not been received by the other party; or
2 (b) The landlord or tenant becomes aware that the electronic mail
3 address provided by the other party is no longer valid.
4 (16) This section shall not be construed to modify, limit, or
5 supersede the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
6 Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., as such act existed on January 1,
7 2025.
8 Sec. 7. Original sections 76-1413, 76-1450, 76-1457, and 76-1474,
9 Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and section 76-1410, Revised
10 Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
