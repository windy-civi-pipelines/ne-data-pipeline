FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 203
Introduced by Juarez, 5; Cavanaugh, J., 9; Cavanaugh, M., 6; DeBoer, 10;
Prokop, 27; Rountree, 3; Spivey, 13.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
evaluate the existing passenger rail infrastructure in Nebraska and gather
feedback from the public to inform future legislation. In recent years,
interest in rail transit and public transportation has grown in Nebraska,
especially among young professionals. In addition to retaining Nebraska's
homegrown talent and meeting the needs of a growing workforce, passenger rail
projects are major development opportunities that drive large public and
private investment.
This study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Examining existing and historic passenger rail infrastructure in
Nebraska;
(2) Examining plans by Amtrak for services relevant to Nebraska in the
future and steps Nebraska has taken to participate in those plans;
(3) Examining public opinion on rail transit in Nebraska, which includes
comments from public meetings hosted across the state. Public meetings may be
held in Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, North Platte, and Columbus, in addition
to other locations; and
(4) Considering actions needed by the Legislature to advance passenger
rail planning in Nebraska, including directing the Department of
Transportation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee of the
Legislature shall be designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the
purposes of this resolution.
