limited to, financial institutions.
(2) The Financial Fraud Victims' Reimbursement Fund is created. The fund
shall be administered by the Attorney General. The fund shall consist of assets
forfeited from financial transaction offenses as provided in subdivision (8)(b)

be invested by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital

pro rata basis according to the amount of the qualifying loss suffered.
