1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 16 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Municipal Police Oversight Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds that oversight of municipal law
4 enforcement agencies is a matter of state concern, particularly in larger
5 cities which maintain sizeable police forces. Municipal law enforcement
6 agencies are the primary agencies providing enforcement of criminal laws
7 adopted under state law. Under the Civil Service Act, certain cities
8 having a population of more than five thousand inhabitants which employ
9 full-time police officers must maintain a civil service commission. The
10 Legislature finds that certain cities should also establish oversight
11 boards to monitor, investigate, and evaluate police standards and
12 practices.
13 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Municipal Police Oversight Act:
14 (1) City means any city of the metropolitan class or city of the
15 primary class, including any city which has adopted a home rule charter
16 pursuant to sections 2 to 5 of Article XI of the Constitution of
17 Nebraska, which employs full-time police officers; and
18 (2) Oversight board means a citizen police oversight board created
19 under section 4 of this act.
20 Sec. 4. On or before January 1, 2028, each city shall, by
21 ordinance, create a citizen police oversight board. The ordinance shall
22 specify the composition, jurisdiction, and powers of the oversight board
23 as provided in the Municipal Police Oversight Act.
24 Sec. 5. Each oversight board shall be composed of seven members of
25 the public who shall serve for terms of five years. The members of the
26 oversight board shall be appointed by the city council and shall consist
27 of individuals who represent a cross-section of the residents of the
28 city. Any member of the oversight board shall be eligible for
29 reappointment to the oversight board at the end of the term for which
30 appointed. No person shall serve on an oversight board if, at the time of
31 appointment, during the term for which appointed, or at any time prior to
-2-

2025 2025
1 such appointment, such person is or was affiliated with or employed by
2 any law enforcement agency, department, or office of the city for which
3 the oversight board was created or of the county in which the city is
4 located.
5 Sec. 6. Each oversight board shall be mandated and empowered by
6 ordinance to:
7 (1) Investigate and address grievances and complaints filed by
8 members of the public against the police department of the city and any
9 officers of such department;
10 (2) Investigate and address grievances and complaints relating to
11 discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender and sexual harassment
12 filed by employees of the police department of such city against any
13 other officers or supervisory personnel of such department;
14 (3) Investigate all shootings involving police officers of such
15 city;
16 (4) Independently investigate all cases of alleged mistreatment or
17 misconduct by the police department of such city and any officers of such
18 department that come to the attention of the oversight board, regardless
19 of whether those cases are the subject of any specific formal complaint
20 or grievance;
21 (5) Identify all instances of police misconduct by police officers
22 of such city and report findings and recommendations in those cases to
23 the police department, the mayor, and the city council of such city and
24 all federal and state registries of police misconduct;
25 (6) When appropriate, provide the police department of such city and
26 other law enforcement agencies with evidence in support of any criminal
27 proceedings, disciplinary proceedings, or other management actions or
28 measures;
29 (7) Provide the police department of such city with feedback from
30 members of the public who have direct experience with police practices;
31 and
-3-

1 (8) Monitor, investigate, and evaluate policing standards, patterns,
2 and practices of the police department of such city.
3 Sec. 7. (1) An oversight board may summarily dismiss a grievance or
4 complaint filed by a member of the public without investigation only when
5 the oversight board determines that:
6 (a) The complainant's interest is not sufficiently related to the
7 subject matter of the grievance or complaint;
8 (b) The grievance or complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious, or
9 not made in good faith;
10 (c) The oversight board's resources are insufficient for an adequate
11 investigation of the grievance or complaint; or
12 (d) The grievance or complaint has been delayed too long to justify
13 a present examination of its merit.
14 (2) A decision by the oversight board to summarily dismiss a
15 grievance or complaint filed by a member of the public without
16 investigation shall not bar the oversight board from incorporating the
17 facts related to such grievance or complaint in other matters
18 investigated by the oversight board.
19 Sec. 8. A city shall provide its oversight board with sufficient
20 funding and resources to adequately perform its duties under the
21 Municipal Police Oversight Act. Each investigation carried out under the
22 authority of the oversight board shall be conducted independently of the
23 police department of such city. The oversight board shall employ
24 dedicated staff investigators, none of whom shall have previously been
25 affiliated with or employed by any law enforcement agency, department, or
26 office of such city or of the county in which the city is located.
27 Sec. 9. Each oversight board and the investigators employed by the
28 oversight board shall be empowered by ordinance with the full range of
29 investigative powers necessary to enable such board and investigators to
30 conduct fair, independent, and effective investigations. Such powers
31 shall include, but are not limited to, the power to:

9 to compel any person to appear, give sworn testimony, or produce
10 documentary or other evidence deemed relevant to a matter under
11 investigation by the oversight board.
12 Sec. 10. To the extent applicable, each oversight board and the
13 investigators employed by an oversight board shall, in evaluating matters

15 standards promulgated by the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and
16 Criminal Justice and the Nebraska Police Standards Advisory Council.
17 Sec. 11. (1) After an investigator employed by an oversight board
18 has completed an investigation of any matter within the authority of the

22 (b) Recommendations to the oversight board relating to the
23 disposition of the matter.
24 (2) After receiving such report, the oversight board shall place the
25 matter on its agenda for the oversight board's next public meeting, and
26 at that meeting the oversight board shall determine the disposition of

28 oversight board shall immediately thereafter publish its conclusions and
29 recommendations in a written summary transmitted to the city police
30 department, the mayor, and the city council.

LB276 LB276
2025 2025
1 police officer involved in a matter that was investigated by the
2 oversight board, the oversight board shall also submit its written

5 potential criminal conduct occurred.
6 (4) All written summaries prepared by an oversight board shall
7 incorporate verbatim copies of the written report submitted to the
