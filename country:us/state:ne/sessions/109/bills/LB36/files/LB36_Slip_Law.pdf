economic development, and individual family health and economic self-
sufficiency. In addition to housing inventory and the availability of homes,
another factor that may hinder population attraction is the quality of homes.
One measurement of housing quality is age. As such, Nebraska must streamline
and maximize all existing housing, weatherization, and home improvement
programs to expand access to affordable quality homes and renovate and
modernize existing aging housing inventory to meet modern standards.
(2) The Home Weatherization Clearinghouse is established within the
Department of Environment and Energy.

37-1802 The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(1) The future vibrancy of the people, communities, and businesses of
Nebraska depends on reliable sources of water;

water supplies, much of the state's water resources are currently
underutilized;
(3) In 2019, the state experienced historic flooding along the Platte
River which caused loss of life and over one billion dollars in damage to
private and public property and infrastructure;
(4) Well-planned flood control is critical to the future of the people,
communities, and businesses of Nebraska;
(5) In light of the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the trend
toward a remote workforce around the country, people around the country are
rethinking where they want to work, live, and raise a family. As people
consider where to live, access to sustainable water resources and outdoor
recreational opportunities will be important considerations in making Nebraska
a competitive choice for the future;
(6) The state's lakes and rivers help Nebraskans enjoy the water resources
in our state and make Nebraska an even more attractive place to live and raise
a family;
(7) The state's water resources provide economic benefits to the people,
communities, and businesses of Nebraska by helping to attract visitors from
other states and boosting local economies;

and public investment necessary to enhance economic development and to catalyze
private investment in the region in Knox County, Nebraska, that lies north of
State Highway 12 and extends to the South Dakota border and includes Lewis and
Clark Lake and Niobrara State Park;
(9) After considerable study, the Statewide Tourism And Recreational Water
Access and Resource Sustainability Special Committee identified the following
potential opportunities:
(a) Marina construction projects or other projects identified to expand
water access or and recreational opportunities at Lake McConaughy and the Lewis
and Clark State Recreation Area; and
(b) Projects A project to increase access to and the enjoyment of Niobrara
State Park through the construction of an event center and lodge or through

opportunities at Lake McConaughy and the Lewis and Clark State Recreation Area
through the construction of new marinas or through infrastructure projects

Sec. 26. Section 39-891, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
39-891 (1) Recognizing that obstructions on or near the boundary of the
State of Nebraska impede commerce and travel between the State of Nebraska and
adjoining states, the Legislature hereby declares that bridges over these
obstructions are essential to the general welfare of the State of Nebraska.
(2) Providing bridges over these obstructions and for the safe and
efficient operation of such bridges is deemed an urgent problem that is the
proper concern of legislative action.
(3) Such bridges, properly planned, designated, and managed, provide a
safe passage for highway traffic to and from the state highway system and
encourage commerce and travel between the State of Nebraska and adjoining
states which increase the social and economic progress and general welfare of
the state.
(4) It is recognized that bridges between the State of Nebraska and
adjoining states are not and cannot be the sole concern of the State of
Nebraska. The nature of such bridges requires that a high degree of cooperation
be exercised between the State of Nebraska and adjoining states in all phases
of planning, construction, maintenance, and operation if proper benefits are to
be realized.
(5) It is also recognized that parties other than the State of Nebraska
may wish to erect and control bridges between the State of Nebraska and
adjoining states and that the construction, operation, and financing of such
bridges have previously been authorized by the Legislature. Such bridges also
benefit the State of Nebraska, and it is not the intent of the Legislature to
abolish such power previously granted.
(6) To this end, it is the intention of the Legislature to supplement
sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and 39-1393 and section 30 of this act, relating to
state highways, in order that the powers and authority of the department
relating to the planning, construction, maintenance, acquisition, and operation
of interstate bridges upon the state highway system may be clarified within a
single act.
(7) Acting under the direction of the Director-State Engineer, the
department, with the advice of the State Highway Commission and the consent of
the Governor, is given the power to enter into agreements with the United
States and adjoining states, subject to the limitations imposed by the
-12-

LB36 LB36
2025 2025
Constitution and the provisions of the Interstate Bridge Act of 1959.
(8) The Legislature intends to place a high degree of trust in the hands
of those officials whose duty it may be to enter into agreements with adjoining
states and the United States for the planning, development, construction,
acquisition, operation, maintenance, and protection of interstate bridges.
(9) In order that the persons concerned may understand the limitations and
responsibilities for planning, constructing, acquiring, operating, and
maintaining interstate bridges upon the state highway system, it is necessary
that the responsibilities for such work shall be fixed, but it is intended that
the department, acting under the Director-State Engineer, shall have sufficient
freedom to enter into agreements with adjoining states regarding any phase of
planning, constructing, acquiring, maintaining, and operating interstate
bridges upon the state highway system in order that the best interests of the
State of Nebraska may always be served. The authority of the department to
enter into agreements with adjoining states, as granted in the act, is therefor
essential.
(10) The Legislature hereby determines and declares that the provisions of
the act are necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
safety, for the promotion of the general welfare, and as a contribution to the
national defense.
Sec. 27. Section 39-893, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
39-893 The provisions of the Interstate Bridge Act of 1959 are intended to
be cumulative to, and not amendatory of, sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and
39-1393 and section 30 of this act.
Sec. 28. Section 39-1301, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
39-1301 (1) Recognizing that safe and efficient highway transportation is
a matter of important interest to all of the people in the state, the
Legislature hereby determines and declares that an integrated system of
highways is essential to the general welfare of the State of Nebraska.
(2) Providing such a system of facilities and the efficient management,
operation, and control thereof are recognized as urgent problems and the proper
objectives of highway legislation.
(3) Adequate highways provide for the free flow of traffic, result in low
cost of motor vehicle operation, protect the health and safety of the citizens
of the state, increase property values, and generally promote economic and
social progress of the state.
(4) It is the intent of the Legislature to consider of paramount
importance the convenience and safety of the traveling public in the location,
relocation, or abandonment of highways.
(5) In designating the highway system of this state, as provided by
sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and 39-1393 and section 30 of this act, the
Legislature places a high degree of trust in the hands of those officials whose
duty it shall be, within the limits of available funds, to plan, develop,
construct, operate, maintain, and protect the highway facilities of this state,
for present as well as for future uses.
(6) The design, construction, maintenance, operation, and protection of
adequate state highway facilities sufficient to meet the present demands as
well as future requirements will, of necessity, require careful organization,
with lines of authority definitely fixed, and basic rules of procedure
established by the Legislature.
(7) To this end, it is the intent of the Legislature, subject to the
limitations of the Constitution and such mandates as the Legislature may impose
by the provisions of such sections 39-1301 to 39-1393 and section 30 of this
act, to designate the Director-State Engineer and the department, acting under
the direction of the Director-State Engineer, as direct custodian of the state
highway system, with full authority in all departmental administrative details,
in all matters of engineering design, and in all matters having to do with the
construction, maintenance, operation, and protection of the state highway
system.
(8) The Legislature intends to declare, in general terms, the powers and
duties of the Director-State Engineer, leaving specific details to be
determined by reasonable rules and regulations which may be promulgated by him
or her. It is the intent of the Legislature to grant authority to the Director-
State Engineer to exercise sufficient power and authority to enable him or her
and the department to carry out the broad objectives stated in this section.
(9) While it is necessary to fix responsibilities for the construction,
maintenance, and operation of the several systems of highways, it is intended
that the State of Nebraska shall have an integrated system of all roads and
streets to provide safe and efficient highway transportation throughout the
state. The authority granted in sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and 39-1393 and
section 30 of this act to the Director-State Engineer and to the political or
governmental subdivisions or public corporations of this state to assist and
cooperate with each other is therefor essential.
(10) The Legislature hereby determines and declares that such sections
39-1301 to 39-1393 and section 30 of this act are necessary for the
