5 Sec. 18. (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that
6 Nebraska is experiencing a persistent and present crisis in regards to
7 affordable quality housing, as evidenced by lower inventory than required
8 to support and sustain a healthy housing market. Housing inventory and
9 availability are critical elements in population attraction and
10 retention, workforce development, economic development, and individual
11 family health and economic self-sufficiency. In addition to housing
12 inventory and the availability of homes, another factor that may hinder
13 population attraction is the quality of homes. One measurement of housing
14 quality is age. As such, Nebraska must streamline and maximize all
15 existing housing, weatherization, and home improvement programs to expand
16 access to affordable quality homes and renovate and modernize existing
17 aging housing inventory to meet modern standards.
18 (2) The Home Weatherization Clearinghouse is established within the
19 Department of Environment and Energy.
20 (3) The clearinghouse shall:
21 (a) Serve as a primary contact point for persons applying for
22 grants, loans, or other programs that fund home weatherization projects,
23 whether administered by the department, other state or local agencies,
24 nonprofits, or the federal government;
25 (b) Serve as a coordinator for other state and local agencies
26 administering or applying for any such grants, loans, or programs; and
27 (c) Coordinate efforts by state and local agencies to maximize the
28 receipt of federal dollars for home weatherization projects.
29 (4) The clearinghouse shall have as its primary focus the
30 facilitation of funding for whole-home rehabilitation projects. As such,
31 all grants that accomplish whole-home rehabilitation projects shall be
-19-

2 relevant federal, state, or local grant program. Additionally,
3 administrative costs for public or nonprofit entities administering such
4 grant programs shall never exceed ten percent of program costs unless
5 expressly required under the relevant federal, state, or local grant
6 program.
7 (5) The Department of Environment and Energy shall utilize existing

28 may issue temporary permits which are either valid for any area or valid
29 for a single area.

QNC - 03/21/2025 QNC - 03/21/2025
1 adjoining states are not and cannot be the sole concern of the State of
2 Nebraska. The nature of such bridges requires that a high degree of
3 cooperation be exercised between the State of Nebraska and adjoining
4 states in all phases of planning, construction, maintenance, and
5 operation if proper benefits are to be realized.
6 (5) It is also recognized that parties other than the State of
7 Nebraska may wish to erect and control bridges between the State of
8 Nebraska and adjoining states and that the construction, operation, and
9 financing of such bridges have previously been authorized by the
10 Legislature. Such bridges also benefit the State of Nebraska, and it is
11 not the intent of the Legislature to abolish such power previously
12 granted.

18 system may be clarified within a single act.
19 (7) Acting under the direction of the Director-State Engineer, the
20 department, with the advice of the State Highway Commission and the
21 consent of the Governor, is given the power to enter into agreements with
22 the United States and adjoining states, subject to the limitations
23 imposed by the Constitution and the provisions of the Interstate Bridge
24 Act of 1959.
25 (8) The Legislature intends to place a high degree of trust in the
26 hands of those officials whose duty it may be to enter into agreements
27 with adjoining states and the United States for the planning,
28 development, construction, acquisition, operation, maintenance, and
29 protection of interstate bridges.
30 (9) In order that the persons concerned may understand the
31 limitations and responsibilities for planning, constructing, acquiring,

6 acquiring, maintaining, and operating interstate bridges upon the state
7 highway system in order that the best interests of the State of Nebraska
8 may always be served. The authority of the department to enter into
9 agreements with adjoining states, as granted in the act, is therefor
10 essential.
11 (10) The Legislature hereby determines and declares that the
12 provisions of the act are necessary for the preservation of the public
13 peace, health, and safety, for the promotion of the general welfare, and
14 as a contribution to the national defense.

23 transportation is a matter of important interest to all of the people in

26 State of Nebraska.
27 (2) Providing such a system of facilities and the efficient
28 management, operation, and control thereof are recognized as urgent
29 problems and the proper objectives of highway legislation.

12 (6) The design, construction, maintenance, operation, and protection
13 of adequate state highway facilities sufficient to meet the present
14 demands as well as future requirements will, of necessity, require
15 careful organization, with lines of authority definitely fixed, and basic
16 rules of procedure established by the Legislature.
17 (7) To this end, it is the intent of the Legislature, subject to the
18 limitations of the Constitution and such mandates as the Legislature may
19 impose by the provisions of such sections 39-1301 to 39-1393 and section
20 30 of this act, to designate the Director-State Engineer and the
21 department, acting under the direction of the Director-State Engineer, as
22 direct custodian of the state highway system, with full authority in all
23 departmental administrative details, in all matters of engineering
24 design, and in all matters having to do with the construction,
25 maintenance, operation, and protection of the state highway system.
26 (8) The Legislature intends to declare, in general terms, the powers
27 and duties of the Director-State Engineer, leaving specific details to be
28 determined by reasonable rules and regulations which may be promulgated
29 by him or her. It is the intent of the Legislature to grant authority to

3 construction, maintenance, and operation of the several systems of
4 highways, it is intended that the State of Nebraska shall have an
5 integrated system of all roads and streets to provide safe and efficient
6 highway transportation throughout the state. The authority granted in
7 sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and 39-1393 and section 30 of this act to the
8 Director-State Engineer and to the political or governmental subdivisions
9 or public corporations of this state to assist and cooperate with each
10 other is therefor essential.
11 (10) The Legislature hereby determines and declares that such
12 sections 39-1301 to 39-1393 and section 30 of this act are necessary for
13 the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, for promotion
14 of the general welfare, and as a contribution to the national defense.

8 to support and sustain a healthy housing market. Housing inventory and
9 availability are critical elements in population attraction and
10 retention, workforce development, economic development, and individual
11 family health and economic self-sufficiency. In addition to housing
12 inventory and the availability of homes, another factor that may hinder
13 population attraction is the quality of homes. One measurement of housing
14 quality is age. As such, Nebraska must streamline and maximize all
15 existing housing, weatherization, and home improvement programs to expand
16 access to affordable quality homes and renovate and modernize existing
17 aging housing inventory to meet modern standards.
18 (2) The Home Weatherization Clearinghouse is established within the
19 Department of Environment and Energy.
20 (3) The clearinghouse shall:
21 (a) Serve as a primary contact point for persons applying for
22 grants, loans, or other programs that fund home weatherization projects,
23 whether administered by the department, other state or local agencies,
24 nonprofits, or the federal government;
25 (b) Serve as a coordinator for other state and local agencies
26 administering or applying for any such grants, loans, or programs; and
27 (c) Coordinate efforts by state and local agencies to maximize the
28 receipt of federal dollars for home weatherization projects.
29 (4) The clearinghouse shall have as its primary focus the
30 facilitation of funding for whole-home rehabilitation projects. As such,
31 all grants that accomplish whole-home rehabilitation projects shall be

19 the State of Nebraska impede commerce and travel between the State of
20 Nebraska and adjoining states, the Legislature hereby declares that
21 bridges over these obstructions are essential to the general welfare of
22 the State of Nebraska.
23 (2) Providing bridges over these obstructions and for the safe and
24 efficient operation of such bridges is deemed an urgent problem that is
25 the proper concern of legislative action.
26 (3) Such bridges, properly planned, designated, and managed, provide
27 a safe passage for highway traffic to and from the state highway system
28 and encourage commerce and travel between the State of Nebraska and
29 adjoining states which increase the social and economic progress and

31 (4) It is recognized that bridges between the State of Nebraska and
-33-

AM635 AM635
LB36 LB36
QNC - 03/21/2025 QNC - 03/21/2025
1 adjoining states are not and cannot be the sole concern of the State of
2 Nebraska. The nature of such bridges requires that a high degree of
3 cooperation be exercised between the State of Nebraska and adjoining
4 states in all phases of planning, construction, maintenance, and
5 operation if proper benefits are to be realized.
6 (5) It is also recognized that parties other than the State of
7 Nebraska may wish to erect and control bridges between the State of
8 Nebraska and adjoining states and that the construction, operation, and
9 financing of such bridges have previously been authorized by the
10 Legislature. Such bridges also benefit the State of Nebraska, and it is
11 not the intent of the Legislature to abolish such power previously
12 granted.
13 (6) To this end, it is the intention of the Legislature to
14 supplement sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and 39-1393 and section 30 of this
15 act, relating to state highways, in order that the powers and authority
16 of the department relating to the planning, construction, maintenance,
17 acquisition, and operation of interstate bridges upon the state highway
18 system may be clarified within a single act.
19 (7) Acting under the direction of the Director-State Engineer, the
20 department, with the advice of the State Highway Commission and the
21 consent of the Governor, is given the power to enter into agreements with
22 the United States and adjoining states, subject to the limitations
23 imposed by the Constitution and the provisions of the Interstate Bridge
24 Act of 1959.
25 (8) The Legislature intends to place a high degree of trust in the
26 hands of those officials whose duty it may be to enter into agreements
27 with adjoining states and the United States for the planning,
28 development, construction, acquisition, operation, maintenance, and
29 protection of interstate bridges.
30 (9) In order that the persons concerned may understand the
31 limitations and responsibilities for planning, constructing, acquiring,
-34-

AM635 AM635
LB36 LB36
QNC - 03/21/2025 QNC - 03/21/2025
1 operating, and maintaining interstate bridges upon the state highway
2 system, it is necessary that the responsibilities for such work shall be
3 fixed, but it is intended that the department, acting under the Director-
4 State Engineer, shall have sufficient freedom to enter into agreements
5 with adjoining states regarding any phase of planning, constructing,
6 acquiring, maintaining, and operating interstate bridges upon the state
7 highway system in order that the best interests of the State of Nebraska
8 may always be served. The authority of the department to enter into
9 agreements with adjoining states, as granted in the act, is therefor
10 essential.
11 (10) The Legislature hereby determines and declares that the
12 provisions of the act are necessary for the preservation of the public
13 peace, health, and safety, for the promotion of the general welfare, and
14 as a contribution to the national defense.
15 Sec. 27. Section 39-893, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
16 2024, is amended to read:
17 39-893 The provisions of the Interstate Bridge Act of 1959 are
18 intended to be cumulative to, and not amendatory of, sections 39-1301 to
19 39-1362 and 39-1393 and section 30 of this act.
20 Sec. 28. Section 39-1301, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
21 2024, is amended to read:

23 transportation is a matter of important interest to all of the people in
24 the state, the Legislature hereby determines and declares that an
25 integrated system of highways is essential to the general welfare of the
26 State of Nebraska.
27 (2) Providing such a system of facilities and the efficient
28 management, operation, and control thereof are recognized as urgent
29 problems and the proper objectives of highway legislation.
30 (3) Adequate highways provide for the free flow of traffic, result
31 in low cost of motor vehicle operation, protect the health and safety of

7 sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and 39-1393 and section 30 of this act, the
8 Legislature places a high degree of trust in the hands of those officials
9 whose duty it shall be, within the limits of available funds, to plan,
10 develop, construct, operate, maintain, and protect the highway facilities
11 of this state, for present as well as for future uses.
12 (6) The design, construction, maintenance, operation, and protection
13 of adequate state highway facilities sufficient to meet the present
14 demands as well as future requirements will, of necessity, require
15 careful organization, with lines of authority definitely fixed, and basic
16 rules of procedure established by the Legislature.
17 (7) To this end, it is the intent of the Legislature, subject to the
18 limitations of the Constitution and such mandates as the Legislature may
19 impose by the provisions of such sections 39-1301 to 39-1393 and section
20 30 of this act, to designate the Director-State Engineer and the
21 department, acting under the direction of the Director-State Engineer, as
22 direct custodian of the state highway system, with full authority in all
23 departmental administrative details, in all matters of engineering
24 design, and in all matters having to do with the construction,
25 maintenance, operation, and protection of the state highway system.
26 (8) The Legislature intends to declare, in general terms, the powers
27 and duties of the Director-State Engineer, leaving specific details to be
28 determined by reasonable rules and regulations which may be promulgated
29 by him or her. It is the intent of the Legislature to grant authority to
30 the Director-State Engineer to exercise sufficient power and authority to
31 enable him or her and the department to carry out the broad objectives

2 (9) While it is necessary to fix responsibilities for the
3 construction, maintenance, and operation of the several systems of
4 highways, it is intended that the State of Nebraska shall have an
5 integrated system of all roads and streets to provide safe and efficient
6 highway transportation throughout the state. The authority granted in
7 sections 39-1301 to 39-1362 and 39-1393 and section 30 of this act to the
8 Director-State Engineer and to the political or governmental subdivisions
9 or public corporations of this state to assist and cooperate with each
10 other is therefor essential.
11 (10) The Legislature hereby determines and declares that such
12 sections 39-1301 to 39-1393 and section 30 of this act are necessary for
13 the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, for promotion
14 of the general welfare, and as a contribution to the national defense.
