-19-

LB36 LB36
2025 2025

2 to support and sustain a healthy housing market. Housing inventory and
3 availability are critical elements in population attraction and
4 retention, workforce development, economic development, and individual
5 family health and economic self-sufficiency. In addition to housing
6 inventory and the availability of homes, another factor that may hinder
7 population attraction is the quality of homes. One measurement of housing
8 quality is age. As such, Nebraska must streamline and maximize all
9 existing housing, weatherization, and home improvement programs to expand
10 access to affordable quality homes and renovate and modernize existing
11 aging housing inventory to meet modern standards.
12 (2) The Home Weatherization Clearinghouse is established within the
13 Department of Environment and Energy.
14 (3) The clearinghouse shall:
15 (a) Establish a hub for information about the availability and

19 or the federal government; and
20 (b) Assist in coordination efforts by state and local agencies to
21 optimize the execution of home weatherization projects.
22 (4) The Department of Environment and Energy shall utilize existing
23 staff to carry out this section.
24 Sec. 19. Section 37-438, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,

24 disability was not incurred in the line of duty in the military service.
25 (b) All disabled veteran permits issued pursuant to this subsection
26 shall be perpetual and shall become void only upon termination of
27 eligibility as provided in this subsection.

26 collect and retain an issuing fee pursuant to section 37-406 a fee of not
27 more than one dollar, as established by the commission pursuant to

2 39-891 (1) Recognizing that obstructions on or near the boundary of
3 the State of Nebraska impede commerce and travel between the State of
4 Nebraska and adjoining states, the Legislature hereby declares that
5 bridges over these obstructions are essential to the general welfare of
6 the State of Nebraska.
7 (2) Providing bridges over these obstructions and for the safe and
8 efficient operation of such bridges is deemed an urgent problem that is
9 the proper concern of legislative action.
10 (3) Such bridges, properly planned, designated, and managed, provide
11 a safe passage for highway traffic to and from the state highway system
12 and encourage commerce and travel between the State of Nebraska and
13 adjoining states which increase the social and economic progress and
14 general welfare of the state.
15 (4) It is recognized that bridges between the State of Nebraska and
16 adjoining states are not and cannot be the sole concern of the State of
17 Nebraska. The nature of such bridges requires that a high degree of
18 cooperation be exercised between the State of Nebraska and adjoining
19 states in all phases of planning, construction, maintenance, and
20 operation if proper benefits are to be realized.
21 (5) It is also recognized that parties other than the State of
22 Nebraska may wish to erect and control bridges between the State of
23 Nebraska and adjoining states and that the construction, operation, and
24 financing of such bridges have previously been authorized by the
25 Legislature. Such bridges also benefit the State of Nebraska, and it is
26 not the intent of the Legislature to abolish such power previously
27 granted.

3 (7) Acting under the direction of the Director-State Engineer, the
4 department, with the advice of the State Highway Commission and the
5 consent of the Governor, is given the power to enter into agreements with
6 the United States and adjoining states, subject to the limitations
7 imposed by the Constitution and the provisions of the Interstate Bridge
8 Act of 1959.
9 (8) The Legislature intends to place a high degree of trust in the
10 hands of those officials whose duty it may be to enter into agreements
11 with adjoining states and the United States for the planning,
12 development, construction, acquisition, operation, maintenance, and
13 protection of interstate bridges.
14 (9) In order that the persons concerned may understand the
15 limitations and responsibilities for planning, constructing, acquiring,
16 operating, and maintaining interstate bridges upon the state highway
17 system, it is necessary that the responsibilities for such work shall be
18 fixed, but it is intended that the department, acting under the Director-
19 State Engineer, shall have sufficient freedom to enter into agreements
20 with adjoining states regarding any phase of planning, constructing,
21 acquiring, maintaining, and operating interstate bridges upon the state
22 highway system in order that the best interests of the State of Nebraska
23 may always be served. The authority of the department to enter into
24 agreements with adjoining states, as granted in the act, is therefor
25 essential.

28 peace, health, and safety, for the promotion of the general welfare, and

12 management, operation, and control thereof are recognized as urgent
13 problems and the proper objectives of highway legislation.
14 (3) Adequate highways provide for the free flow of traffic, result
15 in low cost of motor vehicle operation, protect the health and safety of
16 the citizens of the state, increase property values, and generally

24 whose duty it shall be, within the limits of available funds, to plan,

27 (6) The design, construction, maintenance, operation, and protection
28 of adequate state highway facilities sufficient to meet the present
29 demands as well as future requirements will, of necessity, require
30 careful organization, with lines of authority definitely fixed, and basic
31 rules of procedure established by the Legislature.

10 (8) The Legislature intends to declare, in general terms, the powers
11 and duties of the Director-State Engineer, leaving specific details to be
12 determined by reasonable rules and regulations which may be promulgated

14 the Director-State Engineer to exercise sufficient power and authority to
15 enable him or her and the department to carry out the broad objectives
16 stated in this section.
17 (9) While it is necessary to fix responsibilities for the
18 construction, maintenance, and operation of the several systems of
19 highways, it is intended that the State of Nebraska shall have an
20 integrated system of all roads and streets to provide safe and efficient
21 highway transportation throughout the state. The authority granted in

23 Director-State Engineer and to the political or governmental subdivisions
24 or public corporations of this state to assist and cooperate with each
