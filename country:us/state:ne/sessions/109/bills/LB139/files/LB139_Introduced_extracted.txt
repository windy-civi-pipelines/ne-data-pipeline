2 2024, is amended to read:
3 76-2239 (1)(a) (1) The board may, upon its own motion, and shall,
4 upon the written complaint of any aggrieved person, cause an
5 investigation to be made with respect to an alleged violation of the Real
6 Property Appraiser Act. Upon receipt of information indicating a
7 violation of the Real Property Appraiser Act, the board shall make an
8 investigation of the facts to determine if there is evidence of a
9 violation. If technical assistance is required for investigation, the
10 board may contract with or use any qualified person for such technical
11 assistance.
12 (b) The board may revoke or suspend the credential or otherwise
13 discipline a credential holder, revoke or suspend a qualifying or
14 continuing education course or activity, deny any application, or issue a
15 cease and desist order, or enter into a contingent dismissal agreement
16 with remedial measures with a credential holder for any violation of the
17 Real Property Appraiser Act.
18 (c) Any disciplinary action taken against a credentialed real
19 property appraiser, including any action that limits a credentialed real
20 property appraiser's ability to engage in real property appraisal
21 practice, shall be reported to federal authorities as required by Title
22 XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of
23 1989. A successfully completed contingent dismissal agreement is not
24 disciplinary action. Upon receipt of information indicating that a person
25 may have violated any provision of the Real Property Appraiser Act, the
26 board shall make an investigation of the facts to determine whether or
27 not there is evidence of a violation. If technical assistance is
28 required, the board may contract with or use qualified persons.
29 (2)(a) If an investigation indicates that a person may have violated
30 a provision of the act, the board may offer the person an opportunity to
31 voluntarily and informally discuss the alleged violation before the

7 (c) If an investigation indicates that a credential holder has
8 violated a provision of the act, a formal complaint shall be prepared by

10 require the credential holder to file an answer within thirty days of the
11 date of service. In responding to a complaint, the credential holder may
12 admit the allegations of the complaint, deny the allegations of the
13 complaint, or plead otherwise. Failure to make a timely response shall be
14 deemed an admission of the allegations of the complaint. Upon receipt of
15 an answer to the complaint, the director or chairperson of the board
16 shall set a date, time, and place for an administrative hearing on the
17 complaint. The date of the hearing shall not be less than thirty nor more

16 or indirectly for another, offers, attempts, or agrees to perform all

18 described in subdivision (7) of such section, shall be deemed an
19 appraisal management company within the meaning of the Nebraska Appraisal

21 sufficient contact with this state for the exercise of personal
22 jurisdiction over such person in any action arising out of the act.

8 (a) A material violation of the act;
9 (b) A violation of any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated by
10 the board; or

16 fines or civil penalties that are reasonable in light of the nature,
17 extent, and severity of the violation. The board shall also take action
18 against an appraisal management company's registration only after less
19 severe sanctions have proven insufficient to ensure behavior consistent
20 with the Nebraska Appraisal Management Company Registration Act. When
21 deciding whether to impose a sanction permitted by subsection (4) of this
