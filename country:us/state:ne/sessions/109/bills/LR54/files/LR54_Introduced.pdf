ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 54
Introduced by McKinney, 11.
WHEREAS, in his final days as president, former President Joe Biden
posthumously pardoned Marcus Garvey, the leader of the Universal Negro
Improvement Association (UNIA), on January 19, 2025; and
WHEREAS, Marcus formed UNIA in 1914 in Jamaica with an intentional focus
on Black self-reliance and a back-to-Africa movement; and
WHEREAS, Marcus moved to Harlem, New York, in 1916, where Marcus organized
the International Conference for the Negro Peoples of the World and created the
Black Star Line; and
WHEREAS, the Black Star Line eventually failed due to the company being
heavily affected by the Great Depression and due to J. Edgar Hoover's sabotage
by using the Federal Bureau of Investigation to infiltrate the shipping
company; and
WHEREAS, Marcus lost his credibility after the collapse, was prosecuted
for mail fraud, and was eventually deported, and in 1940, Marcus suffered a
stroke causing the media to prematurely publish obituaries focused on his mail
fraud conviction. The action caused Marcus so much distress that he suffered a
second stroke and passed away; and
WHEREAS, Marcus was posthumously pardoned to undo the hate garnered
towards his ideas and to restore respect to his name and ideas.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Legislature recognizes the hard work of the people fighting
continuously to provide evidence for Marcus Garvey's posthumous pardon.
2. That the Legislature congratulates Marcus Garvey, his family, and his
descendents on his posthumous pardon.
