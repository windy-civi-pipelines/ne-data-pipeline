11 (5)(a) Prior to July 1, 2021:
12 (i) Beginning July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, the
13 board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed that will
14 value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
15 required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
16 actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
17 recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with
18 the board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
19 the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate,
20 plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial
21 accrued liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
22 under this method shall be determined for each individual member on a
23 level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount is then summed
24 for all members;
25 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall
26 be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period, and during each
27 subsequent actuarial valuation through June 30, 2021, changes in the
28 unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits,
29 actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or
30 losses shall be measured and amortized over a thirty-year period
31 beginning on the valuation date of such change;
-6-
LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
2 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
3 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
4 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
5 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period
6 as of the actuarial valuation date; and
7 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
8 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
9 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
10 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
11 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act.
12 (5)(a) (b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
13 (i) The board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be
14 performed that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the
15 contributions required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board
16 shall perform an actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of
17 actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved by the board,
18 and kept on file with the board using the entry age actuarial cost
19 method. Under such method, the actuarially required funding rate is equal
20 to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize
21 the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of salary
22 basis. The normal cost under such method shall be determined for each
23 individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
24 amount is then summed for all members;
25 (ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
26 changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method,
27 or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a
28 twenty-five-year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
29 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
30 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
31 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
-7-
LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
2 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a twenty-five-year
3 period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
4 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
5 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
6 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
7 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
8 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the act.
9 (b) (c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and
10 after the board notifies the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of the
11 Legislature, the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases
12 to reduce future volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such
13 notification to the committee shall be in writing and include, at a
14 minimum, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the plan
15 if the combination or offset were not implemented, the actuary's
16 projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or
17 offset were implemented, and the actuary's explanation of why the
18 combination or offset is in the best interests of the plan at the
19 proposed time.
20 (c) (d) For purposes of this subsection, the rate of all
21 contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act includes (i)
22 member contributions, (ii) state contributions pursuant to subsection (6)
23 of this section which shall be considered as a contribution for the plan
24 year ending the prior June 30, (iii) court fees as provided in subsection
25 (3) of this section, and (iv) all fees pursuant to sections 25-2804,
26 33-103, 33-103.01, 33-106.02, 33-123, 33-124, 33-125, 33-126.02,
27 33-126.03, and 33-126.06, as directed to be remitted to the fund.
28 (6)(a) In addition to the contributions otherwise required by this
29 section, beginning July 1, 2023, and on July 1 of each year thereafter,
30 or as soon thereafter as administratively possible, the State Treasurer
31 shall transfer from the General Fund to the Nebraska Retirement Fund for
-8-
LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 Judges an amount equal to five percent of the total annual compensation
2 of all members of the retirement system except as otherwise provided in
3 this subsection and as such rate shall be adjusted or terminated by the
4 Legislature. No adjustment may cause the total contribution rate
5 established in this subsection to exceed five percent. For purposes of
6 this subsection, (i) total annual compensation is based on the total
7 member compensation reported in the most recent annual actuarial
8 valuation report for the retirement system produced for the board
9 pursuant to section 84-1503 and (ii) the contribution described in this
10 subsection shall be considered as a contribution for the plan year ending
11 the prior June 30.
12 (b) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is at or
13 above one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
14 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
15 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
16 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
17 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
18 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
19 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
20 annual actuarial valuation report.
21 (c) If the state contribution rate has been adjusted to less than
22 five percent and the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is
23 below one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
24 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
25 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
26 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
27 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
28 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
29 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
30 annual actuarial valuation report.
31 (d) If an annual actuarial valuation report includes a
-9-
LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 recommendation from the actuary to adjust the contribution rate as
2 described in subdivision (b) or (c) of this subsection, the board shall
3 provide written notice electronically to the Nebraska Retirement Systems
4 Committee of the Legislature, to the Governor, and to the Supreme Court
5 of such recommendation within seven business days after voting to approve
6 an annual actuarial valuation report. The notice shall include the
7 actuary's recommendation and analysis regarding such adjustment.
8 (e) Following receipt of the actuary's recommendation and analysis
9 pursuant to this subsection, the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of
10 the Legislature shall determine the amount of any adjustment of the
11 contribution rate and, if necessary, shall propose any such adjustment to
12 the Legislature.
13 (7) The state or county shall pick up the member contributions
14 required by this section for all compensation paid on or after January 1,

16 contributions pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code
17 in determining federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be
18 included as gross income of the member until such time as they are
19 distributed or made available. The contributions, although designated as
20 member contributions, shall be paid by the state or county in lieu of
21 member contributions. The state or county shall pay these member
22 contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying
23 earnings to the member. The state or county shall pick up these
24 contributions by a compensation deduction through a reduction in the
25 compensation of the member. Member contributions picked up shall be
26 treated for all purposes of the Judges Retirement Act in the same manner
27 and to the extent as member contributions made prior to the date picked
28 up.

-17-
LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 based program or service who defaults on the payment of any such fees
2 may, at the discretion of the court, be subject to removal from such non-
3 probation-based program or service. This subdivision does not preclude a
4 court or other governmental entity from charging additional local fees
5 for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services or
6 other similar non-probation-based programs and services.
7 (3) The court shall establish the administrative enrollment fee and
8 monthly probation programming fees as follows:
9 (a) Adult probationers placed on either probation or intensive
10 supervision probation and participants in non-probation-based programs or

13 probation supervision or participation in a non-probation-based program
14 or service;
15 (b) Adult probationers placed on probation shall pay a monthly
16 probation programming fee of twenty-five dollars, not later than the
17 tenth day of each month, for the duration of probation; and
18 (c) Adult probationers placed on intensive supervision probation and
19 participants in non-probation-based programs or services shall pay a
20 monthly probation programming fee of thirty-five dollars, not later than
21 the tenth day of each month, for the duration of probation or
22 participation in a non-probation-based program or service.
23 (4) The court shall waive payment of the monthly probation
24 programming fees in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination
25 is made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the
26 offender due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical
27 or mental handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period
28 of time that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based
29 program or service is unable to pay his or her monthly probation
30 programming fee.
31 (5) If a probationer defaults in the payment of monthly probation
-18-
LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 programming fees or any installment thereof, the court may revoke his or
2 her probation for nonpayment, except that probation shall not be revoked
3 nor shall the offender be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
4 probationer is financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so
5 states to the court in writing under oath, and if the court so finds
6 after a hearing.
7 (6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
8 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
9 refusal to obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's
10 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
11 payment, the court may enter an order allowing the probationer additional
12 time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking
13 the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.
14 (7) No probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program
15 or service shall be required to pay more than one monthly probation
16 programming fee per month. This subsection does not preclude local fees
17 as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
18 (8) The imposition of monthly probation programming fees in this
19 section shall be considered separate and apart from the fees described in
20 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262.
21 (9) Any adult probationer received for supervision pursuant to
22 section 29-2637 or the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision
23 shall be assessed both a one-time administrative enrollment fee and
24 monthly probation programming fees during the period of time the
25 probationer is actively supervised by Nebraska probation authorities.
26 (10) The probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program
27 or service shall pay the fees described in this section to the clerk of
28 the court. The clerk of the court shall remit all fees so collected to

11 pay the sum ordered or to pay over any health care plan benefit sums
12 received, the court may proceed against him or her as for contempt,

28 exceed twenty-five dollars if the information is not timely received or
29 the money is delinquent. In addition, the board may charge a late fee of
30 thirty-eight thousandths of one percent of the amount required to be
31 submitted pursuant to this section for each day such amount has not been
-5-

1 received. Such late fees shall be remitted to the director who shall
2 promptly thereafter remit such fees to the State Treasurer for credit to
3 the fund.
4 (e) No Nebraska Retirement Fund for Judges fee which is
5 uncollectible for any reason shall be waived by a county judge as
6 provided in section 29-2709.
7 (4) All expenditures from the fund shall be authorized by voucher in
8 the manner prescribed in section 24-713. The fund shall be used for the
9 payment of all annuities and other benefits to members and their
10 beneficiaries and for the expenses of administration.
11 (5)(a) Prior to July 1, 2021:
12 (i) Beginning July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, the
13 board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed that will
14 value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
15 required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
16 actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
17 recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with
18 the board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
19 the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate,
20 plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial
21 accrued liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
22 under this method shall be determined for each individual member on a
23 level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount is then summed
24 for all members;
25 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall
26 be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period, and during each
27 subsequent actuarial valuation through June 30, 2021, changes in the
28 unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits,
29 actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or
30 losses shall be measured and amortized over a thirty-year period
31 beginning on the valuation date of such change;
-6-

LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
2 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
3 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
4 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
5 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period
6 as of the actuarial valuation date; and
7 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
8 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
9 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
10 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
11 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act.
12 (5)(a) (b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
13 (i) The board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be
14 performed that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the
15 contributions required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board
16 shall perform an actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of
17 actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved by the board,
18 and kept on file with the board using the entry age actuarial cost
19 method. Under such method, the actuarially required funding rate is equal
20 to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize
21 the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of salary
22 basis. The normal cost under such method shall be determined for each
23 individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
24 amount is then summed for all members;
25 (ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
26 changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method,
27 or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a
28 twenty-five-year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
29 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
30 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
31 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
-7-

LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
2 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a twenty-five-year
3 period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
4 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
5 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
6 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
7 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
8 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the act.
9 (b) (c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and
10 after the board notifies the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of the
11 Legislature, the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases
12 to reduce future volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such
13 notification to the committee shall be in writing and include, at a
14 minimum, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the plan
15 if the combination or offset were not implemented, the actuary's
16 projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or
17 offset were implemented, and the actuary's explanation of why the
18 combination or offset is in the best interests of the plan at the
19 proposed time.
20 (c) (d) For purposes of this subsection, the rate of all
21 contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act includes (i)
22 member contributions, (ii) state contributions pursuant to subsection (6)
23 of this section which shall be considered as a contribution for the plan
24 year ending the prior June 30, (iii) court fees as provided in subsection
25 (3) of this section, and (iv) all fees pursuant to sections 25-2804,
26 33-103, 33-103.01, 33-106.02, 33-123, 33-124, 33-125, 33-126.02,
27 33-126.03, and 33-126.06, as directed to be remitted to the fund.
28 (6)(a) In addition to the contributions otherwise required by this
29 section, beginning July 1, 2023, and on July 1 of each year thereafter,
30 or as soon thereafter as administratively possible, the State Treasurer
31 shall transfer from the General Fund to the Nebraska Retirement Fund for
-8-

LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 Judges an amount equal to five percent of the total annual compensation
2 of all members of the retirement system except as otherwise provided in
3 this subsection and as such rate shall be adjusted or terminated by the
4 Legislature. No adjustment may cause the total contribution rate
5 established in this subsection to exceed five percent. For purposes of
6 this subsection, (i) total annual compensation is based on the total
7 member compensation reported in the most recent annual actuarial
8 valuation report for the retirement system produced for the board
9 pursuant to section 84-1503 and (ii) the contribution described in this
10 subsection shall be considered as a contribution for the plan year ending
11 the prior June 30.
12 (b) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is at or
13 above one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
14 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
15 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
16 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
17 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
18 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
19 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
20 annual actuarial valuation report.
21 (c) If the state contribution rate has been adjusted to less than
22 five percent and the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is
23 below one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
24 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
25 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
26 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
27 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
28 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
29 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
30 annual actuarial valuation report.
31 (d) If an annual actuarial valuation report includes a
-9-

LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 recommendation from the actuary to adjust the contribution rate as
2 described in subdivision (b) or (c) of this subsection, the board shall
3 provide written notice electronically to the Nebraska Retirement Systems
4 Committee of the Legislature, to the Governor, and to the Supreme Court
5 of such recommendation within seven business days after voting to approve
6 an annual actuarial valuation report. The notice shall include the
7 actuary's recommendation and analysis regarding such adjustment.
8 (e) Following receipt of the actuary's recommendation and analysis
9 pursuant to this subsection, the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of
10 the Legislature shall determine the amount of any adjustment of the
11 contribution rate and, if necessary, shall propose any such adjustment to
12 the Legislature.
13 (7) The state or county shall pick up the member contributions
14 required by this section for all compensation paid on or after January 1,
15 1985, and the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer
16 contributions pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code
17 in determining federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be
18 included as gross income of the member until such time as they are
19 distributed or made available. The contributions, although designated as
20 member contributions, shall be paid by the state or county in lieu of
21 member contributions. The state or county shall pay these member
22 contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying
23 earnings to the member. The state or county shall pick up these
24 contributions by a compensation deduction through a reduction in the
25 compensation of the member. Member contributions picked up shall be
26 treated for all purposes of the Judges Retirement Act in the same manner
27 and to the extent as member contributions made prior to the date picked
28 up.

14 whenever a district court or county court sentences an adult offender to
15 probation, the court shall require the probationer to pay a one-time
16 administrative enrollment fee and thereafter a monthly probation
17 programming fee. An individual described in section 1 of this act shall
18 not be required to pay any fees under this section. No court or
19 governmental entity shall charge such an individual any local fee for
20 participation in a non-probation-based program or service.
21 (2) Participants in non-probation-based programs or services in
22 which probation personnel or probation resources are utilized pursuant to
23 an interlocal agreement authorized by subdivision (16) of section 29-2252
24 and in which all or a portion of the costs of such probation personnel or
25 such probation resources are covered by funds provided pursuant to
26 section 29-2262.07 shall pay the one-time administrative enrollment fee
27 described in subdivision (3)(a) of this section and the monthly probation
28 programming fee described in subdivision (3)(c) of this section. In

31 probation-based programs or services. Any participant in a non-probation-
-17-

LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 based program or service who defaults on the payment of any such fees
2 may, at the discretion of the court, be subject to removal from such non-
3 probation-based program or service. This subdivision does not preclude a
4 court or other governmental entity from charging additional local fees
5 for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services or
6 other similar non-probation-based programs and services.
7 (3) The court shall establish the administrative enrollment fee and
8 monthly probation programming fees as follows:
9 (a) Adult probationers placed on either probation or intensive
10 supervision probation and participants in non-probation-based programs or
11 services shall pay a one-time administrative enrollment fee of thirty
12 dollars. The fee shall be paid in a lump sum upon the beginning of
13 probation supervision or participation in a non-probation-based program
14 or service;
15 (b) Adult probationers placed on probation shall pay a monthly
16 probation programming fee of twenty-five dollars, not later than the
17 tenth day of each month, for the duration of probation; and
18 (c) Adult probationers placed on intensive supervision probation and
19 participants in non-probation-based programs or services shall pay a
20 monthly probation programming fee of thirty-five dollars, not later than
21 the tenth day of each month, for the duration of probation or
22 participation in a non-probation-based program or service.
23 (4) The court shall waive payment of the monthly probation
24 programming fees in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination
25 is made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the
26 offender due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical
27 or mental handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period
28 of time that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based
29 program or service is unable to pay his or her monthly probation
30 programming fee.
31 (5) If a probationer defaults in the payment of monthly probation
-18-

LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 programming fees or any installment thereof, the court may revoke his or
2 her probation for nonpayment, except that probation shall not be revoked
3 nor shall the offender be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
4 probationer is financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so
5 states to the court in writing under oath, and if the court so finds
6 after a hearing.
7 (6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
8 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
9 refusal to obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's
10 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
11 payment, the court may enter an order allowing the probationer additional
12 time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking
13 the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.
14 (7) No probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program
15 or service shall be required to pay more than one monthly probation
16 programming fee per month. This subsection does not preclude local fees
17 as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
18 (8) The imposition of monthly probation programming fees in this
19 section shall be considered separate and apart from the fees described in
20 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262.
21 (9) Any adult probationer received for supervision pursuant to

13 they desire to retain counsel.
14 (b) In counties having a population of one hundred fifty thousand or
15 more inhabitants, when any juvenile court petition is filed alleging
16 jurisdiction of a juvenile pursuant to subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or
17 (4) of section 43-247, counsel shall be appointed for such juvenile.
18 (c) The court shall inform any juvenile described in this subsection
19 and his or her parent or guardian of such juvenile's right to counsel at
20 county expense if none of them is able to afford counsel. If the juvenile
21 or his or her parent or guardian desires to have counsel appointed for
22 such juvenile, or the parent or guardian of such juvenile cannot be
23 located, and the court ascertains that none of such persons are able to
24 afford an attorney, the court shall forthwith appoint an attorney to
25 represent such juvenile for all proceedings before the juvenile court. ,
26 except that if an attorney is appointed to represent such juvenile and
27 the court later determines that a parent of such juvenile is able to
28 afford an attorney, the court shall order such parent or juvenile to pay
29 for services of the attorney to be collected in the same manner as
30 provided by section 43-290. If the parent willfully refuses to pay any
31 such sum, the court may commit him or her for contempt, and execution may

1 issue at the request of the appointed attorney or the county attorney or
2 by the court without a request.
3 (2) The court, on its own motion or upon application of a party to
4 the proceedings, shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the juvenile: (a)
5 If the juvenile has no parent or guardian of his or her person or if the
6 parent or guardian of the juvenile cannot be located or cannot be brought
7 before the court; (b) if the parent or guardian of the juvenile is
8 excused from participation in all or any part of the proceedings; (c) if
9 the parent is a juvenile or an incompetent; (d) if the parent is
10 indifferent to the interests of the juvenile; or (e) in any proceeding
11 pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (3)(a) of section 43-247.
12 A guardian ad litem shall have the duty to protect the interests of
13 the juvenile for whom he or she has been appointed guardian, and shall be
14 deemed a parent of the juvenile as to those proceedings with respect to
15 which his or her guardianship extends.
16 (3) The court shall appoint an attorney as guardian ad litem. A
17 guardian ad litem shall act as his or her own counsel and as counsel for
18 the juvenile, unless there are special reasons in a particular case why
19 the guardian ad litem or the juvenile or both should have separate
20 counsel. In such cases the guardian ad litem shall have the right to
21 counsel, except that the guardian ad litem shall be entitled to appointed
22 counsel without regard to his or her financial ability to retain counsel.
23 Whether such appointed counsel shall be provided at the cost of the
24 county shall be determined as provided in subsection (1) of this section.
25 (4) The By July 1, 2015, the Supreme Court shall provide by court
26 rule standards for guardians ad litem for juveniles in juvenile court
27 proceedings.
28 (5) The By July 1, 2017, the Supreme Court shall provide guidelines
29 setting forth standards for all attorneys who practice in juvenile court.

LB65 LB65
2025 2025
1 43-290 (1) It is the purpose of this section to promote parental
2 responsibility and to provide for the most equitable use and availability
3 of public money.
4 (2) Pursuant to a petition filed by a county attorney or city
5 attorney having knowledge of a juvenile in his or her jurisdiction who
6 appears to be a juvenile described in subdivision (3)(a), (3)(c) (1),
7 (2), (3), or (4) of section 43-247, whenever the care or custody of a
8 juvenile is given by the court to someone other than his or her parent,
9 which shall include placement with a state agency, or when a juvenile is
10 given medical, psychological, or psychiatric study or treatment under
11 order of the court, the court shall make a determination of support to be
12 paid by a parent for the juvenile at the same proceeding at which
13 placement, study, or treatment is determined or at a separate proceeding.
14 Such proceeding, which may occur prior to, at the same time as, or
15 subsequent to adjudication, shall be in the nature of a disposition
16 hearing.
17 (3) At such proceeding, after summons to the parent of the time and
18 place of hearing served as provided in sections 43-262 to 43-267, the
19 court may order and decree that the parent shall pay, in such manner as
20 the court may direct, a reasonable sum that will cover in whole or part
21 the support, study, and treatment of the juvenile, which amount ordered
22 paid shall be the extent of the liability of the parent. The court in
23 making such order shall give due regard to the cost of the support,
24 study, and treatment of the juvenile, the ability of the parent to pay,
25 and the availability of money for the support of the juvenile from
26 previous judicial decrees, social security benefits, veterans benefits,
27 or other sources. Support thus received by the court shall be transmitted
28 to the person, agency, or institution having financial responsibility for
29 such support, study, or treatment and, if a state agency or institution,
30 remitted by such state agency or institution quarterly to the Director of
31 Administrative Services for credit to the proper fund.

1 (4) Whenever medical, psychological, or psychiatric study or
2 treatment is ordered by the court, whether or not the juvenile is placed
3 with someone other than his or her parent, or if such study or treatment
4 is otherwise provided as determined necessary by the custodian of the
5 juvenile, the court shall inquire as to the availability of insured or
6 uninsured health care coverage or service plans which include the
7 juvenile. The court may order the parent to pay over any plan benefit
8 sums received on coverage for the juvenile. The payment of any deductible
9 under the health care benefit plan covering the juvenile shall be the
10 responsibility of the parent. If the parent willfully fails or refuses to
11 pay the sum ordered or to pay over any health care plan benefit sums
12 received, the court may proceed against him or her as for contempt,
13 either on the court's own motion or on the motion of the county attorney
14 or authorized attorney as provided in section 43-512, or execution shall
15 issue at the request of any person, agency, or institution treating or
16 maintaining such juvenile. The court may afterwards, because of a change
17 in the circumstances of the parties, revise or alter the order of payment
18 for support, study, or treatment.
19 (5) If the juvenile has been committed to the care and custody of
20 the Department of Health and Human Services, the department shall pay the
21 costs for the support, study, or treatment of the juvenile which are not
22 otherwise paid by the juvenile's parent.
23 (6) If no provision is otherwise made by law for the support or
24 payment for the study or treatment of the juvenile, compensation for the
25 support, study, or treatment shall be paid, when approved by an order of
26 the court, out of a fund which shall be appropriated by the county in
27 which the petition is filed.
28 (7) The juvenile court shall retain jurisdiction over a parent
29 ordered to pay support for the purpose of enforcing such support order
30 for so long as such support remains unpaid but not to exceed ten years
31 from the nineteenth birthday of the youngest child for whom support was

2 (8) The court shall not assess any costs described in this section
3 against a juvenile or the juvenile's parent or guardian in any case filed
4 under subdivision (1), (2), or (3)(b) of section 43-247. However, the
5 court may inquire as to the availability of insured or uninsured health
6 care coverage or service plans which include the juvenile. If such
7 coverage or plans are in effect, the court may order the parent or
8 guardian to continue paying any deductible for such coverage or plan.
9 Sec. 30. No fine shall be imposed against a juvenile or parent or
10 guardian of a juvenile in any proceeding under the Nebraska Juvenile
11 Code.
