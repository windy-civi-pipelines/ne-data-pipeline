1 Section 1. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
4 villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define,
5 regulate, suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race,
6 color, creed, religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin,
7 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in
8 section 20-308.01, or age, or military or veteran status in employment,
9 public accommodation, and housing and may provide for the enforcement of
10 such ordinances by providing appropriate penalties for the violation
11 thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment practice to refuse
12 employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses if such policy
13 is equally applied to both sexes.
14 Sec. 2. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county
17 may adopt resolutions which are substantially equivalent to the Age
18 Discrimination in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice
19 Act, the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and
20 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
21 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
22 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
23 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to
24 those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or resolution may
25 include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages or other
26 equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a petition
27 in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
28 local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
29 equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission
30 or other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and
31 shall have authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to
-2-

LB694 LB694
2025 2025
1 enforce such orders or relief in the district court with appropriate
2 jurisdiction. Certified copies of such ordinances or resolutions shall be
3 transmitted to the commission. When the commission determines that any
4 such city or county has enacted an ordinance or adopted a resolution that
5 is substantially equivalent to such acts and sections or is more
6 comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
7 rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance or
8 resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
9 such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints
10 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
11 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
12 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
13 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
14 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
15 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
16 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
17 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties
18 or the interests of justice require such action, the commission may
19 regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in the same
20 manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies. In
21 cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
22 subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.
23 (2)(a) Any club which has been issued a license by the Nebraska
24 Liquor Control Commission to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic liquor
25 shall have that license revoked if the club discriminates because of
26 race, color, religion, sex, familial status as defined in section 20-311,
27 disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or national origin, or
28 military or veteran status in the sale, serving, or dispensing of
29 alcoholic liquor to any person who is a guest of a member of such club.
30 (b) The procedure for revocation shall be as prescribed in sections
31 53-134.04, 53-1,115, and 53-1,116.

20 guilty of discriminatory practice and shall be subject to the penalties
21 of sections 20-132 to 20-143.
22 (2) It is not a discriminatory practice under sections 20-132 to
23 20-143 for a person or a place of public accommodation to, on an
24 otherwise nondiscriminatory basis, limit admission or service to veterans
25 or servicemembers or their family members or provide discounts or other
26 benefits to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.

3 23-2525 The county personnel officer shall, with the assistance of

7 within the department in which the vacancy occurs;

27 charges at a hearing before the commission at a time and place which
28 shall be specified in such notice. Such hearing shall be within the
29 county where the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. The
30 complainant shall be a party to the proceeding, and in the discretion of
31 the commission any other person whose testimony has a bearing on the
-41-

LB694 LB694
2025 2025
1 matter may be allowed to intervene therein. Both the complainant and the
2 respondent, in addition to the commission, may introduce witnesses at the
3 hearing. The respondent may file a verified answer to the allegations of
4 the complaint and may appear at such hearing in person and with or
5 without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by either
6 party. All evidence shall be under oath and a record thereof shall be
7 made and preserved. Such proceedings shall, so far as practicable, be
8 conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the
9 district courts of the State of Nebraska, and shall be of public record.
10 (2) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any
11 book, document, paper, or account in any investigation, or inquiry by, or
12 hearing before the commission when ordered to do so, upon the ground that
13 the testimony or evidence, book, document, paper, or account required of
14 such person may tend to incriminate such person in or subject such person
15 to penalty or forfeiture; but no person shall be prosecuted, punished, or
16 subjected to any forfeiture or penalty for or on account of any act,
17 transaction, matter, or thing concerning which such person shall have
18 been compelled under oath to testify or produce documentary evidence,
19 except that no person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or
20 punishment for any perjury committed by such person in his or her
21 testimony. Such immunity shall extend only to a natural person who, in
22 obedience to a subpoena, gives testimony under oath or produces evidence,
23 documentary or otherwise, under oath. Nothing in this subsection shall be

27 (3) After the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall,
28 within ten days of the receipt of the transcript or the receipt of the
29 recommendations from the hearing officer, make and file its findings of
30 fact and conclusions of law and make and enter an appropriate order. The
31 hearing officer need not refer to the page and line numbers of the
-42-

LB694 LB694
2025 2025
1 transcript when making his or her recommendation to the commission. Such
2 findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be in sufficient detail to
3 enable a court on appeal to determine the controverted questions
4 presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight was given to the
5 evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
6 intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
7 employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such
8 respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from
9 such unlawful employment practice and order such other affirmative action
10 as may be appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to,
11 reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay
12 liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the
13 filing of the charge with the commission. Interim earnings or amounts
14 earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated
15 against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.
16 (4) A complainant who has suffered physical, emotional, or financial
17 harm as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any
18 stage of the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in
19 the district court of the county where such alleged violation occurred.
20 If the complainant files a district court action on the charge, the
21 complainant shall provide written notice of such filing to the
22 commission, and such notification shall immediately terminate all
23 proceedings before the commission. The district court shall file and try
24 such case as any other civil action, and any successful complainant shall
25 be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or permanent
26 injunctive relief, general and special damages, reasonable attorney's
27 fees, and costs.
28 (5) No order of the commission shall require the admission or
29 reinstatement of an individual as a member of a labor organization or the
30 hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or
31 the payment to him or her of any backpay, if such individual was refused
-43-
