3 43-512 (1) Any dependent child as defined in section 43-504 or any
4 relative or eligible caretaker of such a dependent child may file with
5 the Department of Health and Human Services a written application for
6 financial assistance for such child on forms furnished by the department.
7 (2) The department, through its agents and employees, shall make
8 such investigation pursuant to the application as it deems necessary or
9 as may be required by the county attorney or authorized attorney. If the
10 investigation or the application for financial assistance discloses that
11 such child has a parent or stepparent who is able to contribute to the
12 support of such child and has failed to do so, a copy of the finding of
13 such investigation and a copy of the application shall immediately be
14 filed with the county attorney or authorized attorney.
15 (3) The department shall make a finding as to whether the
16 application referred to in subsection (1) of this section should be
17 allowed or denied. If the department finds that the application should be
18 allowed, the department shall further find the amount of monthly
19 assistance which should be paid with reference to such dependent child.
20 Except as may be otherwise provided, payments shall be made by unit size
21 and shall be consistent with subdivisions (1)(p), (1)(q), (1)(t), (1)(u),

23 2015, the maximum payment level for monthly assistance shall be
24 calculated and tied to the annual inflation factor fifty-five percent of
25 the standard of need described in section 43-513.
26 No payments shall be made for amounts totaling less than ten dollars
27 per month except in the recovery of overpayments.

29 dependent child shall be based in each case upon the conditions disclosed
