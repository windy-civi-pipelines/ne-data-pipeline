1 more, may agree to pay a call premium of not to exceed four percent of
2 the par value for the redemption of such bonds. Districts organized under
3 Chapter 31 or 39 may agree to pay a call premium of not to exceed two
4 percent of the par value of such bonds when a single issue is five
5 hundred thousand dollars or more, and bonds of such districts shall have
6 no other bond redemption call or prepayment restrictions except as
7 provided in this section. Bonds listed in subdivisions (1)(a) through (1)
8 (d) of this section may contain such provisions with respect to their
9 redemption as the public power district, public power and irrigation

11 authority, school district, Board of Regents, or Board of Trustees shall
12 provide.
13 (3) All bonds issued which do not provide a special procedure for
14 calling and prepayments may shall be called by a resolution or ordinance
15 passed by the governing body of the obligor, which resolution or
16 ordinance may condition such call for redemption upon the issuance of
17 refunding bonds of the obligor for such redemption or a similar event
18 which produces funds necessary for such prepayment shall designate the
19 bond or bonds to be prepaid by stating the date of the bonds, the purpose
20 for which the bonds were issued, the bond numbers of the bonds so called,
21 and the date set for prepayment. The issuer of any bonds which are

23 shall, at least thirty days prior to the date set for prepayment of such
24 bonds, send notice by mail of the call to each holder of the called bonds
25 as shown in its records. A true copy of the resolution shall be filed by
26 the obligor with the paying agent on or before the call date.
27 (4) If the obligor deposits sufficient funds with the paying agent
28 to pay the called bonds and accrued interest to date of call in full on
29 or before the call date, the bonds shall cease to be a liability of the
30 obligor, otherwise the call shall be revoked, and the bonds continue in
31 effect the same as though no call had been made.
