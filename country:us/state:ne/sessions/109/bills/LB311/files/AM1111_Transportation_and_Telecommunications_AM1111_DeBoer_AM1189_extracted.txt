20 otherwise be applicable to a competitive local exchange carrier.
21 Sec. 4. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapters 75 and
22 86, only an electing local exchange carrier may initiate a proceeding to
23 deregulate one of such carrier's exchanges. The commission may hold a
24 hearing on the application and receive testimony from the applicant and
25 any other interested person. No later than one hundred twenty days after
26 the date the commission receives an application to initiate such
27 proceeding, the commission shall determine whether the regulated exchange
28 should be deregulated or remain regulated and issue a final order
29 classifying the exchange in accordance with this section. An electing
30 local exchange carrier may file an application with the commission to
31 deregulate an exchange of the carrier that the commission previously
-3-
AM1111 AM1111
LB311 LB311
MLU - 04/17/2025 MLU - 04/17/2025
1 determined should remain regulated upon a material change in the exchange
2 including the entrance of additional carriers providing voice
3 communications service by carriers previously operating in the exchange.
4 The commission may set an application fee at an amount to cover the
5 commission's cost of processing such application.
6 (2)(a) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this
7 section, the commission shall presume that an exchange is competitive and
8 that deregulation of the exchange is in the public interest if, in
9 addition to the electing local exchange carrier, there are at least two
10 other carriers, including one wireline or cable carrier, providing voice
11 communications service in at least ninety percent of the household
12 locations outside of tribal areas known at the time of application in the
13 exchange. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence sufficient to
14 determine that:
15 (i) More than ten percent of the household locations outside of
16 tribal areas known at the time of application in the exchange do not
17 have, in addition to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two
18 other carriers, including one wireline or cable carrier, providing voice
19 communications service; or
20 (ii) Household locations outside of tribal areas known at the time
21 of application in the exchange have no carrier other than the electing
22 local exchange carrier capable of providing voice communications service
23 to locations known at the time of application. For purposes of this
24 subdivision (2)(a)(ii), voice communications shall not include the
25 transmission, conveyance, or routing of real-time, two-way voice
26 communications to a point or between or among points by or through
27 satellite.
28 (b) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section,
29 the commission may determine that an exchange should be deregulated if,
30 in addition to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two other
31 carriers are providing, or are capable of providing, voice communications
-4-
AM1111 AM1111
LB311 LB311
MLU - 04/17/2025 MLU - 04/17/2025
1 service in at least seventy-five percent of the household locations
2 outside of tribal areas known at the time of application in the exchange.
3 (c) In determining whether household locations are capable of being
4 provided voice communications services by a carrier other than the
5 electing local exchange carrier, the commission shall consider evidence
6 related to vacant locations, declination of service to the location, and
7 other evidence related to inaccuracies in the Federal Communications
8 Commission's Broadband Data Collection or other data related to service
9 capability for the location.
10 (d) For the purposes of this subsection, an electing local exchange
11 carrier may rely on data available to the carrier regarding the voice
12 communications service capability, including, but not limited to, data
13 from the Federal Communications Commission's Broadband Data Collection
14 that is available at the time of the application.
15 (e) If the commission deregulates an exchange under this section and
16 the deregulation results in a regulated carrier no longer regulated or a
17 transitioning carrier no longer meeting the definition of a transitioning
18 carrier, the commission shall issue an order reclassifying such carrier
19 as a deregulated carrier.
20 Sec. 5. (1) A deregulated carrier is not required to:
21 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
22 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to
23 quality of retail service;
24 (c) Comply with restrictions on rates for retail telecommunications
25 services, including advanced telecommunications services, unless the
26 restrictions are a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
27 commission or imposed for compliance with sections 86-139 to 86-157; or
28 (d) File an earnings report with the commission.
29 (2) The commission shall not provide a deregulated carrier with any
30 funds from the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund.
31 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapter 86, the
-5-

LB311 LB311
MLU - 04/17/2025 MLU - 04/17/2025
1 commission shall have only the authority over a deregulated carrier
2 provided under the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act. If there
3 is a conflict between the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act
4 and the other applicable provisions of Chapter 86, the Telecommunications
5 Exchange Deregulation Act shall control.
6 (4) Nothing in this section affects the continuing applicability of
7 sections 86-122 to 86-124.
8 (5) The commission may receive, mediate, and hear complaints filed
9 by any retail or wholesale customers against a deregulated carrier that
10 are in the scope of the commission's authority provided under Chapter 86.
11 (6) A telecommunications company or communications provider shall
12 not be required to fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort in
13 an exchange that has been deregulated, unless such telecommunications
14 company or communications provider consents to fulfilling such
15 obligations.
16 Sec. 6. Except as provided by section 7 of this act, a
17 transitioning carrier is governed by the Telecommunications Exchange
18 Deregulation Act and the provisions of Chapters 75 and 86 that applied to
19 the carrier immediately before the date the carrier was classified as a
20 transitioning carrier. If there is a conflict between the
21 Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and other applicable
22 provisions of Chapter 86, the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation
23 Act shall control.
24 Sec. 7. (1) A transitioning carrier is no longer required to do the
25 following in the deregulated exchange:
26 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
27 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to
28 quality of retail service; or
29 (c) Comply with a pricing requirement for retail service unless the
30 requirement is a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
31 commission.

1 (2) A transitioning carrier is not eligible to receive funds from
2 the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund for deregulated
3 exchanges and the commission shall, to the extent feasible in the funding
4 formula, reduce a transitioning carrier's allocation of funds from the
5 Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund to account for
6 deregulated exchanges.
7 Sec. 8. In an exchange that remains regulated, a transitioning
8 carrier shall price the carrier's retail services in accordance with the
9 provisions that applied to that carrier immediately before the date the
10 carrier was classified by the commission as a transitioning carrier.
11 Sec. 9. Nothing in the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act
12 shall relieve a telecommunications or communications provider from the
13 requirements in section 86-124.
14 Sec. 10. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
15 service in a deregulated exchange shall be exempt from subdivision (1)(a)
16 of section 86-134. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
17 service in a deregulated exchange shall be solely subject to subdivision
18 (1)(b) of section 86-134.
19 Sec. 11. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and
20 regulations and conduct any proceedings necessary to administer and
21 enforce the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act, including rules

LB311 LB311
MLU - 04/17/2025 MLU - 04/17/2025
1 disadvantage shall not be created through the granting or withholding of

8 the use by a telecommunications company of a public highway other than:
9 (i) An occupation tax authorized under section 14-109, 15-202,

1 whether to increase such rate has been submitted at a primary or general
2 election at which members of the governing body of the municipality are
3 nominated or elected or at a special election held within the
4 municipality and in which all registered voters shall be entitled to vote
5 on such question. A municipality may not increase its existing rate
6 pursuant to this subsection by more than twenty-five hundredths percent
7 at any one election. The officials of the municipality shall order the
8 submission of the question by submitting a certified copy of the
9 resolution proposing the rate increase to the election commissioner or
10 county clerk at least fifty days before the election. The election shall
11 be conducted in accordance with the Election Act. If a majority of the
12 votes cast upon such question are in favor of such rate increase, then

15 to such rate increase, then the governing body of the municipality shall
16 not impose such rate increase.

18 affect the terms or conditions of any franchise, license, or permit
19 issued by a municipality prior to August 28, 1999, or to release any
20 party from any obligations thereunder. Such franchises, licenses, or
21 permits shall remain fully enforceable in accordance with their terms. A
22 municipality may lawfully enter into agreements with franchise holders,
23 licensees, or permittees to modify or terminate an existing franchise,
24 license, or agreement.

3 to a governing entity municipality by a telecommunications company which
4 such telecommunications company determines to be proprietary shall be
5 deemed to be a trade secret pursuant to subdivision (3) of section
6 84-712.05 and shall be accorded full protection from disclosure to third
7 parties in a manner consistent with state law.
8 (9) For purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise
9 requires:

11 act;
12 (b) Internet-protocol-enabled service has the same meaning as in

2 to, intercarrier compensation;
3 (e) The eligibility and requirements for the receipt of funds from
4 the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund and the rules,
5 regulations, and orders under the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal
6 Service Fund Act or the receipt of funds from the federal Universal
7 Service Fund, regardless of the unregulated status of the provider's

9 (f) Any entity's rights and obligations with respect to (i)

17 (i) The commission's authority to apply or enforce statutory or
18 regulatory provisions against an incumbent local exchange carrier in a

20 otherwise be applicable to a competitive local exchange carrier.
21 Sec. 4. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapters 75 and
22 86, only an electing local exchange carrier may initiate a proceeding to
23 deregulate one of such carrier's exchanges. The commission may hold a
24 hearing on the application and receive testimony from the applicant and
25 any other interested person. No later than one hundred twenty days after
26 the date the commission receives an application to initiate such
27 proceeding, the commission shall determine whether the regulated exchange
28 should be deregulated or remain regulated and issue a final order
29 classifying the exchange in accordance with this section. An electing
30 local exchange carrier may file an application with the commission to
31 deregulate an exchange of the carrier that the commission previously
-3-

AM1111 AM1111
LB311 LB311
MLU - 04/17/2025 MLU - 04/17/2025
1 determined should remain regulated upon a material change in the exchange
2 including the entrance of additional carriers providing voice
3 communications service by carriers previously operating in the exchange.
4 The commission may set an application fee at an amount to cover the
5 commission's cost of processing such application.
6 (2)(a) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this
7 section, the commission shall presume that an exchange is competitive and
8 that deregulation of the exchange is in the public interest if, in
9 addition to the electing local exchange carrier, there are at least two
10 other carriers, including one wireline or cable carrier, providing voice
11 communications service in at least ninety percent of the household
12 locations outside of tribal areas known at the time of application in the
13 exchange. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence sufficient to
14 determine that:
15 (i) More than ten percent of the household locations outside of
16 tribal areas known at the time of application in the exchange do not
17 have, in addition to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two
18 other carriers, including one wireline or cable carrier, providing voice
19 communications service; or
20 (ii) Household locations outside of tribal areas known at the time
21 of application in the exchange have no carrier other than the electing
22 local exchange carrier capable of providing voice communications service
23 to locations known at the time of application. For purposes of this
24 subdivision (2)(a)(ii), voice communications shall not include the
25 transmission, conveyance, or routing of real-time, two-way voice
26 communications to a point or between or among points by or through
27 satellite.
28 (b) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section,
29 the commission may determine that an exchange should be deregulated if,
30 in addition to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two other
31 carriers are providing, or are capable of providing, voice communications
-4-

AM1111 AM1111
LB311 LB311
MLU - 04/17/2025 MLU - 04/17/2025
1 service in at least seventy-five percent of the household locations
2 outside of tribal areas known at the time of application in the exchange.
3 (c) In determining whether household locations are capable of being
4 provided voice communications services by a carrier other than the
5 electing local exchange carrier, the commission shall consider evidence
6 related to vacant locations, declination of service to the location, and
7 other evidence related to inaccuracies in the Federal Communications
8 Commission's Broadband Data Collection or other data related to service
9 capability for the location.
10 (d) For the purposes of this subsection, an electing local exchange
11 carrier may rely on data available to the carrier regarding the voice
12 communications service capability, including, but not limited to, data
13 from the Federal Communications Commission's Broadband Data Collection
14 that is available at the time of the application.
15 (e) If the commission deregulates an exchange under this section and
16 the deregulation results in a regulated carrier no longer regulated or a
17 transitioning carrier no longer meeting the definition of a transitioning
18 carrier, the commission shall issue an order reclassifying such carrier
19 as a deregulated carrier.
20 Sec. 5. (1) A deregulated carrier is not required to:
21 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
22 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to
23 quality of retail service;
24 (c) Comply with restrictions on rates for retail telecommunications
25 services, including advanced telecommunications services, unless the
26 restrictions are a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
27 commission or imposed for compliance with sections 86-139 to 86-157; or
28 (d) File an earnings report with the commission.
29 (2) The commission shall not provide a deregulated carrier with any
30 funds from the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund.

5 Exchange Deregulation Act shall control.
6 (4) Nothing in this section affects the continuing applicability of
7 sections 86-122 to 86-124.
8 (5) The commission may receive, mediate, and hear complaints filed
9 by any retail or wholesale customers against a deregulated carrier that
10 are in the scope of the commission's authority provided under Chapter 86.
11 (6) A telecommunications company or communications provider shall
12 not be required to fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort in
13 an exchange that has been deregulated, unless such telecommunications
14 company or communications provider consents to fulfilling such
15 obligations.
16 Sec. 6. Except as provided by section 7 of this act, a
17 transitioning carrier is governed by the Telecommunications Exchange
18 Deregulation Act and the provisions of Chapters 75 and 86 that applied to
19 the carrier immediately before the date the carrier was classified as a
20 transitioning carrier. If there is a conflict between the
21 Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and other applicable
22 provisions of Chapter 86, the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation
23 Act shall control.
24 Sec. 7. (1) A transitioning carrier is no longer required to do the
25 following in the deregulated exchange:
26 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
27 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to
28 quality of retail service; or
29 (c) Comply with a pricing requirement for retail service unless the
30 requirement is a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
31 commission.

5 Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund to account for
6 deregulated exchanges.
7 Sec. 8. In an exchange that remains regulated, a transitioning
8 carrier shall price the carrier's retail services in accordance with the
9 provisions that applied to that carrier immediately before the date the
10 carrier was classified by the commission as a transitioning carrier.
11 Sec. 9. Nothing in the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act
12 shall relieve a telecommunications or communications provider from the
13 requirements in section 86-124.
14 Sec. 10. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
15 service in a deregulated exchange shall be exempt from subdivision (1)(a)
16 of section 86-134. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
17 service in a deregulated exchange shall be solely subject to subdivision
18 (1)(b) of section 86-134.
19 Sec. 11. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and
20 regulations and conduct any proceedings necessary to administer and
21 enforce the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act, including rules

1 whether to increase such rate has been submitted at a primary or general
2 election at which members of the governing body of the municipality are
3 nominated or elected or at a special election held within the
4 municipality and in which all registered voters shall be entitled to vote
5 on such question. A municipality may not increase its existing rate
6 pursuant to this subsection by more than twenty-five hundredths percent
7 at any one election. The officials of the municipality shall order the
8 submission of the question by submitting a certified copy of the
9 resolution proposing the rate increase to the election commissioner or
10 county clerk at least fifty days before the election. The election shall

18 affect the terms or conditions of any franchise, license, or permit
19 issued by a municipality prior to August 28, 1999, or to release any
20 party from any obligations thereunder. Such franchises, licenses, or
21 permits shall remain fully enforceable in accordance with their terms. A
22 municipality may lawfully enter into agreements with franchise holders,
23 licensees, or permittees to modify or terminate an existing franchise,
24 license, or agreement.
