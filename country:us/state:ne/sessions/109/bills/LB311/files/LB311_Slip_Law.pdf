2025 2025
terms, and conditions, including the resolution of disputes arising from, and

compensation;
(e) The eligibility and requirements for the receipt of funds from the

and orders under the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund Act or
the receipt of funds from the federal Universal Service Fund, regardless of the
unregulated status of the provider's service under the Telecommunications
Exchange Deregulation Act;
(f) Any entity's rights and obligations with respect to (i) registration
under section 86-125, (ii) the use of public streets, roads, highways, and

(g) The commission's authority under the 911 Service System Act or the
Telecommunications Relay System Act;
(h) Any provision of the Rural Communications Sustainability Act; and
(i) The commission's authority to apply or enforce statutory or regulatory
provisions against an incumbent local exchange carrier in a deregulated
exchange if such statutory or regulatory provisions could otherwise be
applicable to a competitive local exchange carrier.
Sec. 4. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapters 75 and 86,
only an electing local exchange carrier may initiate a proceeding to deregulate
one of such carrier's exchanges. The commission may hold a hearing on the
application and receive testimony from the applicant and any other interested
person. No later than one hundred twenty days after the date the commission
receives an application to initiate such proceeding, the commission shall
determine whether the regulated exchange should be deregulated or remain
regulated and issue a final order classifying the exchange in accordance with
this section. An electing local exchange carrier may file an application with
the commission to deregulate an exchange of the carrier that the commission
previously determined should remain regulated upon a material change in the
exchange including the entrance of additional carriers providing voice
communications service by carriers previously operating in the exchange. The
commission may set an application fee at an amount to cover the commission's
cost of processing such application.
(2)(a) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section, the
commission shall presume that an exchange is competitive and that deregulation
of the exchange is in the public interest if, in addition to the electing local
exchange carrier, there are at least two other carriers, including one wireline
or cable carrier, providing voice communications service in at least ninety
percent of the household locations outside of tribal areas known at the time of
application in the exchange. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence
sufficient to determine that:
(i) More than ten percent of the household locations outside of tribal
areas known at the time of application in the exchange do not have, in addition
to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two other carriers, including
one wireline or cable carrier, providing voice communications service; or
(ii) Household locations outside of tribal areas known at the time of
application in the exchange have no carrier other than the electing local
exchange carrier capable of providing voice communications service to locations
known at the time of application. For purposes of this subdivision (2)(a)(ii),
voice communications shall not include the transmission, conveyance, or routing
of real-time, two-way voice communications to a point or between or among
points by or through satellite.
(b) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section, the
commission may determine that an exchange should be deregulated if, in addition
to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two other carriers are
providing, or are capable of providing, voice communications service in at
least seventy-five percent of the household locations outside of tribal areas
known at the time of application in the exchange.
(c) In determining whether household locations are capable of being
provided voice communications services by a carrier other than the electing
local exchange carrier, the commission shall consider evidence related to
vacant locations, declination of service to the location, and other evidence
related to inaccuracies in the Federal Communications Commission's Broadband
Data Collection or other data related to service capability for the location.
(d) For the purposes of this subsection, an electing local exchange
carrier may rely on data available to the carrier regarding the voice
communications service capability, including, but not limited to, data from the
Federal Communications Commission's Broadband Data Collection that is available
at the time of the application.
(e) If the commission deregulates an exchange under this section and the
deregulation results in a regulated carrier no longer regulated or a
transitioning carrier no longer meeting the definition of a transitioning
carrier, the commission shall issue an order reclassifying such carrier as a
deregulated carrier.
Sec. 5. (1) A deregulated carrier is not required to:
(a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
(b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to quality of
retail service;
(c) Comply with restrictions on rates for retail telecommunications
services, including advanced telecommunications services, unless the
restrictions are a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
-2-

2025 2025
commission or imposed for compliance with sections 86-139 to 86-157; or
(d) File an earnings report with the commission.
(2) The commission shall not provide a deregulated carrier with any funds
from the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapter 86, the commission
shall have only the authority over a deregulated carrier provided under the
Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act. If there is a conflict between
the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and the other applicable
provisions of Chapter 86, the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act
shall control.
(4) Nothing in this section affects the continuing applicability of
sections 86-122 to 86-124.
(5) The commission may receive, mediate, and hear complaints filed by any
retail or wholesale customers against a deregulated carrier that are in the
scope of the commission's authority provided under Chapter 86.
(6) A telecommunications company or communications provider shall not be
required to fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort in an exchange
that has been deregulated, unless such telecommunications company or
communications provider consents to fulfilling such obligations.
Sec. 6. Except as provided by section 7 of this act, a transitioning
carrier is governed by the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and the
provisions of Chapters 75 and 86 that applied to the carrier immediately before
the date the carrier was classified as a transitioning carrier. If there is a
conflict between the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and other
applicable provisions of Chapter 86, the Telecommunications Exchange
Deregulation Act shall control.
Sec. 7. (1) A transitioning carrier is no longer required to do the
following in the deregulated exchange:
(a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
(b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to quality of
retail service; or
(c) Comply with a pricing requirement for retail service unless the
requirement is a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
commission.
(2) A transitioning carrier is not eligible to receive funds from the
Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund for deregulated exchanges
and the commission shall, to the extent feasible in the funding formula, reduce
a transitioning carrier's allocation of funds from the Nebraska
Telecommunications Universal Service Fund to account for deregulated exchanges.
Sec. 8. In an exchange that remains regulated, a transitioning carrier
shall price the carrier's retail services in accordance with the provisions
that applied to that carrier immediately before the date the carrier was
classified by the commission as a transitioning carrier.
Sec. 9. Nothing in the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act shall
relieve a telecommunications or communications provider from the requirements
in section 86-124.
Sec. 10. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue service in a
deregulated exchange shall be exempt from subdivision (1)(a) of section 86-134.
A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue service in a deregulated
exchange shall be solely subject to subdivision (1)(b) of section 86-134.
Sec. 11. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
and conduct any proceedings necessary to administer and enforce the
Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act, including rules and regulations
to determine whether an exchange should remain regulated, be deregulated, or be
reregulated.
Sec. 12. (1) For purposes of this section:
(a) Action means any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, resolution, or
similar action by a governing entity;
(b) Governing entity means (i) a state agency acting in any capacity and
(ii) an agency, municipality, county, member of the public power industry, or
