7 commercial information and withhold such information from public
8 disclosure pursuant to subdivision (3) of section 84-712.05.
9 (3) The Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act shall not
10 affect or modify:
11 (a) The enforcement of criminal or civil laws, including, but not
12 limited to, laws concerning consumer protection and unfair or deceptive
13 trade practices which apply generally to the conduct of business;

2 service under the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act;
3 (f) Any entity's rights and obligations with respect to (i)

15 Sec. 4. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapters 75 and
16 86, only an electing local exchange carrier may initiate a proceeding to
17 deregulate one of such carrier's exchanges. The commission may hold a
18 hearing on the application and receive testimony from the applicant and
19 any other interested person. No later than one hundred twenty days after
20 the date the commission receives an application to initiate such
21 proceeding, the commission shall determine whether the regulated exchange
22 should be deregulated or remain regulated and issue a final order
23 classifying the exchange in accordance with this section. An electing
24 local exchange carrier may file an application with the commission to
25 deregulate an exchange of the carrier that the commission previously
26 determined should remain regulated upon a material change in the exchange
27 including the entrance of additional carriers providing voice
28 communications service by carriers previously operating in the exchange.
29 The commission may set an application fee at an amount to cover the
30 commission's cost of processing such application.
31 (2)(a) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this
-5-

LB311 LB311
2025 2025
1 section, the commission shall presume that an exchange is competitive and
2 that deregulation of the exchange is in the public interest if, in
3 addition to the electing local exchange carrier, there are at least two
4 other carriers, including one wireline or cable carrier, providing voice
5 communications service in at least ninety percent of the household
6 locations outside of tribal areas known at the time of application in the
7 exchange. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence sufficient to
8 determine that:
9 (i) More than ten percent of the household locations outside of
10 tribal areas known at the time of application in the exchange do not
11 have, in addition to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two
12 other carriers, including one wireline or cable carrier, providing voice
13 communications service; or
14 (ii) Household locations outside of tribal areas known at the time
15 of application in the exchange have no carrier other than the electing
16 local exchange carrier capable of providing voice communications service
17 to locations known at the time of application. For purposes of this
18 subdivision (2)(a)(ii), voice communications shall not include the
19 transmission, conveyance, or routing of real-time, two-way voice
20 communications to a point or between or among points by or through
21 satellite.
22 (b) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section,
23 the commission may determine that an exchange should be deregulated if,
24 in addition to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two other
25 carriers are providing, or are capable of providing, voice communications
26 service in at least seventy-five percent of the household locations
27 outside of tribal areas known at the time of application in the exchange.
28 (c) In determining whether household locations are capable of being
29 provided voice communications services by a carrier other than the
30 electing local exchange carrier, the commission shall consider evidence
31 related to vacant locations, declination of service to the location, and
-6-

LB311 LB311
2025 2025
1 other evidence related to inaccuracies in the Federal Communications
2 Commission's Broadband Data Collection or other data related to service
3 capability for the location.
4 (d) For the purposes of this subsection, an electing local exchange
5 carrier may rely on data available to the carrier regarding the voice
6 communications service capability, including, but not limited to, data
7 from the Federal Communications Commission's Broadband Data Collection
8 that is available at the time of the application.
9 (e) If the commission deregulates an exchange under this section and
10 the deregulation results in a regulated carrier no longer regulated or a
11 transitioning carrier no longer meeting the definition of a transitioning
12 carrier, the commission shall issue an order reclassifying such carrier
13 as a deregulated carrier.
14 Sec. 5. (1) A deregulated carrier is not required to:
15 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
16 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to
17 quality of retail service;
18 (c) Comply with restrictions on rates for retail telecommunications
19 services, including advanced telecommunications services, unless the
20 restrictions are a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
21 commission or imposed for compliance with sections 86-139 to 86-157; or
22 (d) File an earnings report with the commission.
23 (2) The commission shall not provide a deregulated carrier with any
24 funds from the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund.
25 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapter 86, the
26 commission shall have only the authority over a deregulated carrier
27 provided under the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act. If there
28 is a conflict between the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act
29 and the other applicable provisions of Chapter 86, the Telecommunications
30 Exchange Deregulation Act shall control.
31 (4) Nothing in this section affects the continuing applicability of
-7-

LB311 LB311
2025 2025
1 sections 86-122 to 86-124.
2 (5) The commission may receive, mediate, and hear complaints filed
3 by any retail or wholesale customers against a deregulated carrier that
4 are in the scope of the commission's authority provided under Chapter 86.
5 (6) A telecommunications company or communications provider shall
6 not be required to fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort in
7 an exchange that has been deregulated, unless such telecommunications
8 company or communications provider consents to fulfilling such
9 obligations.
10 Sec. 6. Except as provided by section 7 of this act, a
11 transitioning carrier is governed by the Telecommunications Exchange
12 Deregulation Act and the provisions of Chapters 75 and 86 that applied to
13 the carrier immediately before the date the carrier was classified as a
14 transitioning carrier. If there is a conflict between the
15 Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and other applicable
16 provisions of Chapter 86, the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation
17 Act shall control.
18 Sec. 7. (1) A transitioning carrier is no longer required to do the
19 following in the deregulated exchange:
20 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
21 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to
22 quality of retail service; or
23 (c) Comply with a pricing requirement for retail service unless the
24 requirement is a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
25 commission.
26 (2) A transitioning carrier is not eligible to receive funds from
27 the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund for deregulated
28 exchanges and the commission shall, to the extent feasible in the funding
29 formula, reduce a transitioning carrier's allocation of funds from the
30 Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund to account for
31 deregulated exchanges.

LB311 LB311
2025 2025
1 Sec. 8. In an exchange that remains regulated, a transitioning
2 carrier shall price the carrier's retail services in accordance with the
3 provisions that applied to that carrier immediately before the date the
4 carrier was classified by the commission as a transitioning carrier.
5 Sec. 9. Nothing in the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act
6 shall relieve a telecommunications or communications provider from the
7 requirements in section 86-124.
8 Sec. 10. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
9 service in a deregulated exchange shall be exempt from subdivision (1)(a)
10 of section 86-134. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
11 service in a deregulated exchange shall be solely subject to subdivision
12 (1)(b) of section 86-134.
13 Sec. 11. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and
14 regulations and conduct any proceedings necessary to administer and
15 enforce the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act, including rules
16 and regulations to determine whether an exchange should remain regulated,
17 be deregulated, or be reregulated.
