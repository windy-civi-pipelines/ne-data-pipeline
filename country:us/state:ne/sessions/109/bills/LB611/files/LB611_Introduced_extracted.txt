14 assistance to low-income Nebraskans, (6) to reduce the amount of money
15 expended to import energy, (7) to reduce the growth of energy
16 consumption, (8) to lessen the need for new power plants, and (9) to
17 provide training for local code officials and residential and commercial
18 builders who implement the 2021 2018 International Energy Conservation
19 Code.
20 Sec. 7. Section 81-1611, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 81-1611 The Legislature hereby adopts the 2021 2018 International

25 adopt regulations specifying alternative standards for building systems,
26 techniques, equipment designs, or building materials that shall be deemed
27 equivalent to the Nebraska Energy Code. Regulations specifying
28 alternative standards may be deemed equivalent to the Nebraska Energy
29 Code and may be approved for general or limited use if the use of such
30 alternative standards would not result in energy consumption greater than
31 would result from the strict application of the Nebraska Energy Code.
