WHEREAS, over twenty-four thousand babies are born in Nebraska each year
and the mental health of women before, during, and after pregnancy is an issue
of great concern to women, their families, and Nebraska; and
WHEREAS, one in five women and one in seven men are affected by a
Perinatal Mood, Anxiety, and Depression disorder, and may experience associated
symptoms, which are often overlooked and heavily stigmatized because new and
expectant parents suffering from Perinatal Mood, Anxiety, and Depression
disorders often feel confused, ashamed, and isolated; and
WHEREAS, according to the 2024 Maternal Death Review Team report eighteen
percent of pregnancy-associated deaths in Nebraska between 2014 and 2022 had a
contributing circumstance of mental health; and
WHEREAS, seventy percent of women identified during routine screenings do
not seek help because they are not informed about Perinatal Mood, Anxiety, and
Depression disorders as part of their health care, there is a lack of provider
knowledge and use of screening tools, and they are unaware of treatment and
community supportive services for Perinatal Mood, Anxiety, and Depression
disorders; and
WHEREAS, Perinatal Mood, Anxiety, and Depression disorders are highly
treatable with therapeutic intervention such as medication, therapy,
counseling, support groups, and community support services.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Legislature recognizes May 2025 as Maternal Mental Health
Awareness Month in Nebraska.
