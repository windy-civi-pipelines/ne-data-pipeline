18 PART C: OPTIONAL SPECIAL POWERS AND GUIDANCE
19 This part lets you give your Agent additional powers, and to provide

23 My Agent can do the following things ONLY if I have marked or
24 initialed them below:
25 (....) Admit me as a voluntary patient to a facility for mental
26 health treatment for up to ...... days (write in the number of days you
27 want like 7, 14, 30 or another number).
28 (If I do not mark or initial this choice, my Agent MAY NOT admit me
29 as a voluntary patient to this type of facility.)
30 (....) Place me in a nursing home for more than one hundred days
31 even if my needs can be met somewhere else, I am not terminally ill, and
-18-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 I object.
2 (If I do not mark or initial this choice, my Agent MAY NOT do this.)
3 2. ACCESS TO MY HEALTH INFORMATION
4 My Agent may obtain, examine, and share information about my health
5 needs and health care if I am not able to make decisions for myself. If I

10 their own.
11 2. If you make a decision for the person, follow any instructions
12 the person gave, including any in this form.
13 3. If you do not know what the person would want, make the decision
14 that you think is in the person's best interest. To figure out what is in

27 has not been appointed or is not reasonably available.
28 (b) Unless the individual has an advance health-care directive that
29 indicates otherwise, a member of the following classes, in descending
30 order of priority, who is reasonably available and not disqualified under
31 section 14 of this act, may act as a default surrogate for the
-21-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 individual:
2 (1) an adult the individual has identified, other than in a power of
3 attorney for health care, to make a health-care decision for the
4 individual if the individual cannot make the decision;
5 (2) the individual's spouse, unless:
6 (A) a petition for annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage,
7 legal separation, or termination has been filed and not dismissed or
8 withdrawn;
9 (B) a decree of annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal
10 separation, or termination has been issued;

14 (3) the individual's adult child or parent;
15 (4) the individual's cohabitant;
16 (5) the individual's adult sibling;
17 (6) the individual's adult grandchild or grandparent;
18 (7) an adult not listed in subdivisions (1) through (6) who has
19 assisted the individual with supported decision making routinely during
20 the preceding six months;
21 (8) the individual's adult stepchild not listed in subdivisions (1)
22 through (7) whom the individual actively parented during the stepchild's

25 exhibited special care and concern for the individual and is familiar
26 with the individual's personal values.
27 (c) A responsible health-care professional may require an individual
28 who assumes authority to act as a default surrogate to provide a
29 declaration in a record under penalty of perjury stating facts and
30 circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the authority.
31 (d) If a responsible health-care professional reasonably determines
-22-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 that an individual who assumed authority to act as a default surrogate is
2 not willing or able to comply with a duty under section 17 of this act or
3 fails to comply with the duty in a timely manner, the professional may
4 recognize the individual next in priority under subsection (b) of this
5 section as the default surrogate.
6 (e) A health-care decision made by a default surrogate is effective
7 without judicial approval.
8 Sec. 13. (a) A default surrogate who assumes authority under
9 section 12 of this act shall inform a responsible health-care
10 professional if two or more members of a class under subsection (b) of
11 section 12 of this act have assumed authority to act as default
12 surrogates and the members do not agree on a health-care decision.
13 (b) A responsible health-care professional shall comply with the
14 decision of a majority of the members of the class with highest priority
15 under subsection (b) of section 12 of this act who have communicated
16 their views to the professional and the professional reasonably believes
17 are acting consistent with their duties under section 17 of this act.
18 (c) If a responsible health-care professional is informed that the
19 members of the class who have communicated their views to the
20 professional are evenly divided concerning the health-care decision, the
21 professional shall make a reasonable effort to solicit the views of
22 members of the class who are reasonably available but have not yet
23 communicated their views to the professional. The professional, after the
24 solicitation, shall comply with the decision of a majority of the members
25 who have communicated their views to the professional and the
26 professional reasonably believes are acting consistent with their duties
27 under section 17 of this act.
28 (d) If the class remains evenly divided after the effort is made
29 under subsection (c) of this section, the health-care decision must be
30 made as provided by other law of this state regarding the treatment of an
31 individual who is found to lack capacity.
-23-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 Sec. 14. (a) An individual for whom a health-care decision would be
2 made may disqualify another individual from acting as default surrogate
3 for the first individual. The disqualification must be in a record signed
4 by the first individual or communicated verbally or nonverbally to the
5 individual being disqualified, another individual, or a responsible
6 health-care professional. Disqualification under this subsection is
7 effective even if made by an individual who lacks capacity to make an
8 advance directive if the individual clearly communicates a desire that
9 the individual being disqualified not make health-care decisions for the
10 individual.
11 (b) An individual is disqualified from acting as a default surrogate
12 for an individual who lacks capacity to make health-care decisions if:
13 (1) a court finds that the potential default surrogate poses a
14 danger to the individual's well-being, even if the court does not issue a
15 protection order against the potential surrogate;
16 (2) the potential default surrogate is an owner, operator, employee,
17 or contractor of a nursing home or an assisted-living facility as defined
18 in section 71-5903 in which the individual is residing or receiving care
19 unless the owner, operator, employee, or contractor is a family member of
20 the individual, the cohabitant of the individual, or a descendant of the
21 cohabitant; or
22 (3) the potential default surrogate refuses to provide a timely
23 declaration under subsection (c) of section 12 of this act.
24 Sec. 15. (a) An individual may revoke the appointment of an agent,
25 the designation of a default surrogate, or a health-care instruction in
26 whole or in part, unless:
27 (1) a court finds the individual lacks capacity to do so;
28 (2) the individual is found under subsection (b) of section 4 of
29 this act to lack capacity to do so and, if the individual objects to the
30 finding, the finding is confirmed under subdivision (d)(4) of section 5
31 of this act; or
-24-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 (3) the individual created an advance mental health-care directive
2 that includes the provision under subsection (d) of section 9 of this act
3 and the individual is experiencing the psychiatric or psychological event
4 specified in the directive.
5 (b) Revocation under subsection (a) of this section may be by any
6 act of the individual that clearly indicates that the individual intends
7 to revoke the appointment, designation, or instruction, including an oral
8 statement to a health-care professional.
9 (c) Except as provided in section 10 of this act, an advance health-
10 care directive of an individual that conflicts with another advance
11 health-care directive of the individual revokes the earlier directive to
12 the extent of the conflict.
13 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an individual's advance health-care
14 directive appointing an agent, the appointment of a spouse of an
15 individual as agent for the individual is revoked if:
16 (1) a petition for annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage,
17 legal separation, or termination has been filed and not dismissed or
18 withdrawn;
19 (2) a decree of annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal
20 separation, or termination has been issued;
21 (3) the individual and the spouse have agreed in a record to a legal
22 separation; or
23 (4) the spouse has abandoned the individual for more than one year.
24 Sec. 16. (a) An advance health-care directive created outside this
25 state is valid if it complies with:
26 (1) the law of the state specified in the directive or, if a state
27 is not specified, the state in which the individual created the
28 directive; or
29 (2) the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act.
30 (b) A person may assume without inquiry that an advance health-care
31 directive is genuine, valid, and still in effect, and may implement and
-25-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 rely on it, unless the person has good cause to believe the directive is
2 invalid or has been revoked.
3 (c) An advance health-care directive, revocation of a directive, or
4 a signature on a directive or revocation may not be denied legal effect
5 or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.
6 (d) Evidence relating to an advance health-care directive,
7 revocation of a directive, or a signature on a directive or revocation
8 may not be excluded in a proceeding solely because the evidence is in
9 electronic form.
10 (e) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not affect the
11 validity of an electronic record or signature that is valid under the
12 Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
13 (f) If the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act conflicts with other
14 law of this state relating to the creation, execution, implementation, or
15 revocation of an advance health-care directive, the Uniform Health-Care
16 Decisions Act prevails.
17 Sec. 17. (a) An agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary duty to
18 the individual for whom the agent or default surrogate is acting when
19 exercising or purporting to exercise a power under section 18 of this
20 act.
21 (b) An agent or default surrogate shall make a health-care decision
22 in accordance with the direction of the individual in an advance health-
23 care directive and other goals, preferences, and wishes of the individual
24 to the extent known or reasonably ascertainable by the agent or default
25 surrogate.
26 (c) If there is not a direction in an advance health-care directive
27 and the goals, preferences, and wishes of the individual regarding a
28 health-care decision are not known or reasonably ascertainable by the
29 agent or default surrogate, the agent or default surrogate shall make the
30 decision in accordance with the agent's or default surrogate's
31 determination of the individual's best interest.
-26-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 (d) In determining the individual's best interest under subsection
2 (c) of this section, the agent or default surrogate shall:
3 (1) give primary consideration to the individual's contemporaneous
4 communications, including verbal and nonverbal expressions;
5 (2) consider the individual's values to the extent known or
6 reasonably ascertainable by the agent or default surrogate; and
7 (3) consider the risks and benefits of the potential health-care
8 decision.
9 (e) As soon as reasonably feasible, an agent or default surrogate
10 who is informed of a revocation of an advance health-care directive or
11 disqualification of the agent or default surrogate shall communicate the
12 revocation or disqualification to a responsible health-care professional.
13 Sec. 18. (a) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section,
14 the power of an agent or default surrogate commences when the individual
15 is found under subsection (b) of section 4 of this act or by a court to
16 lack capacity to make a health-care decision. The power ceases if the
17 individual later is found to have capacity to make a health-care
18 decision, or the individual objects under subsection (c) of section 5 of
19 this act to the finding of lack of capacity under subsection (b) of
20 section 4 of this act. The power resumes if:
21 (1) the power ceased because the individual objected under
22 subsection (c) of section 5 of this act; and
23 (2) the finding of lack of capacity is confirmed under subdivision
24 (d)(4) of section 5 of this act or a court finds that the individual
25 lacks capacity to make a health-care decision.
26 (b) An agent or default surrogate may request, receive, examine,
27 copy, and consent to the disclosure of medical and other health-care
28 information about the individual if the individual would have the right
29 to request, receive, examine, copy, or consent to the disclosure of the
30 information.
31 (c) A power of attorney for health care may provide that the power
-27-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 of an agent under subsection (b) of this section commences on
2 appointment.
3 (d) If no other person is authorized to do so, an agent or default
4 surrogate may apply for public or private health insurance and benefits
5 on behalf of the individual. An agent or default surrogate who may apply
6 for insurance and benefits does not, solely by reason of the power, have
7 a duty to apply for the insurance or benefits.
8 (e) An agent or default surrogate may not consent to voluntary
9 admission of the individual to a facility for mental health treatment
10 unless:
11 (1) voluntary admission is specifically authorized by the individual
12 in an advance health-care directive in a record; and
13 (2) the admission is for no more than the maximum of the number of
14 days specified in the directive or [insert the number of days a guardian
15 may commit an adult subject to guardianship without using the state's
16 involuntary commitment procedure], whichever is less.
17 (f) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, an agent
18 or default surrogate may not consent to placement of the individual in a
19 nursing home if the placement is intended to be for more than one hundred
20 days if:
21 (1) an alternative living arrangement is reasonably feasible;
22 (2) the individual objects to the placement; or
23 (3) the individual is not terminally ill.
24 (g) If specifically authorized by the individual in an advance
25 health-care directive in a record, an agent or default surrogate may
26 consent to placement of the individual in a nursing home for more than
27 one hundred days even if:
28 (1) an alternative living arrangement is reasonably feasible;
29 (2) the individual objects to the placement; and
30 (3) the individual is not terminally ill.
31 Sec. 19. (a) If an individual has a long-term disability requiring
-28-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 routine treatment by artificial nutrition, hydration, or mechanical
2 ventilation and a history of using the treatment without objection, an
3 agent or default surrogate may not consent to withhold or withdraw the
4 treatment unless:
5 (1) the treatment is not necessary to sustain the individual's life
6 or maintain the individual's well-being;
7 (2) the individual has expressly authorized the withholding or
8 withdrawal in a health-care instruction that has not been revoked; or
9 (3) the individual has experienced a major reduction in health or
10 functional ability from which the individual is not expected to recover,
11 even with other appropriate treatment, and the individual has not:
12 (A) given a direction inconsistent with withholding or withdrawal;
13 or
14 (B) communicated by verbal or nonverbal expression a desire for
15 artificial nutrition, hydration, or mechanical ventilation.
16 (b) A default surrogate may not make a health-care decision if,
17 under other law of this state, the decision:
18 (1) may not be made by a guardian; or
19 (2) may be made by a guardian only if the court appointing the
20 guardian specifically authorizes the guardian to make the decision.
21 Sec. 20. (a) An individual in a power of attorney for health care
22 may appoint multiple individuals as co-agents. Unless the power of
23 attorney provides otherwise, each co-agent may exercise independent
24 authority.
25 (b) An individual in a power of attorney for health care may appoint
26 one or more individuals to act as alternate agents if a predecessor agent
27 resigns, dies, becomes disqualified, is not reasonably available, or
28 otherwise is unwilling or unable to act as agent.
29 (c) Unless the power of attorney provides otherwise, an alternate
30 agent has the same authority as the original agent:
31 (1) at any time the original agent is not reasonably available or is
-29-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 otherwise unwilling or unable to act, for the duration of the
2 unavailability, unwillingness, or inability to act; or
3 (2) if the original agent and all other predecessor agents have
4 resigned or died or are disqualified from acting as agent.
5 Sec. 21. (a) A responsible health-care professional who is aware
6 that an individual has been found to lack capacity to make a decision
7 shall make a reasonable effort to determine if the individual has a
8 surrogate.
9 (b) If possible before implementing a health-care decision made by a
10 surrogate, a responsible health-care professional as soon as reasonably
11 feasible shall communicate to the individual the decision made and the
12 identity of the surrogate.
13 (c) A responsible health-care professional who makes or is informed
14 of a finding that an individual lacks capacity to make a health-care
15 decision or no longer lacks capacity, or that other circumstances exist
16 that affect a health-care instruction or the authority of a surrogate, as
17 soon as reasonably feasible, shall:
18 (1) document the finding or circumstance in the individual's medical
19 record; and
20 (2) if possible, communicate to the individual and the individual's
21 surrogate the finding or circumstance and that the individual may object
22 under subsection (c) of section 5 of this act to the finding under
23 subsection (b) of section 4 of this act.
24 (d) A responsible health-care professional who is informed that an
25 individual has created or revoked an advance health-care directive, or
26 that a surrogate for an individual has been appointed, designated, or
27 disqualified, shall:
28 (1) document the information as soon as reasonably feasible in the
29 individual's medical record; and
30 (2) if evidence of the directive, revocation, appointment,
31 designation, or disqualification is in a record, request a copy and, on
-30-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 receipt, cause the copy to be included in the individual's medical
2 record.
3 (e) Except as provided in subsections (f) and (g) of this section, a
4 health-care professional or health-care institution providing health care
5 to an individual shall comply with:
6 (1) a health-care instruction given by the individual regarding the
7 individual's health care;
8 (2) a reasonable interpretation by the individual's surrogate of an
9 instruction given by the individual; and
10 (3) a health-care decision for the individual made by the
11 individual's surrogate in accordance with sections 17 and 18 of this act
12 to the same extent as if the decision had been made by the individual at
13 a time when the individual had capacity.
14 (f) A health-care professional or a health-care institution may
15 refuse to provide health care consistent with a health-care instruction
16 or health-care decision if:
17 (1) the instruction or decision is contrary to a policy of the
18 health-care institution providing care to the individual that is based
19 expressly on reasons of conscience and the policy was timely communicated
20 to the individual or to the individual's surrogate;
21 (2) the care would require health care that is not available to the
22 professional or institution; or
23 (3) compliance with the instruction or decision would:
24 (A) require the professional to provide care that is contrary to the
25 professional's religious belief or moral conviction if other law permits
26 the professional to refuse to provide care for that reason;
27 (B) require the professional or institution to provide care that is
28 contrary to generally accepted health-care standards applicable to the
29 professional or institution; or
30 (C) violate a court order or other law.
31 (g) A health-care professional or health-care institution that
-31-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025

4 (2) immediately make a reasonable effort to transfer the individual
5 to another health-care professional or health-care institution that is
6 willing to comply with the instruction or decision; and
7 (3) either:
8 (A) if care is refused under subdivision (f)(1) or (2) of this
9 section, provide life-sustaining care and care needed to keep or make the
10 individual comfortable, consistent with accepted medical standards to the
11 extent feasible, until a transfer is made; or
12 (B) if care is refused under subdivision (f)(3) of this section,
13 provide life-sustaining care and care needed to keep or make the
14 individual comfortable, consistent with accepted medical standards, until
15 a transfer is made or, if the professional or institution reasonably
16 believes that a transfer cannot be made, for at least ten days after the
17 refusal.
18 Sec. 22. (a) A guardian may refuse to comply with or revoke the
19 individual's advance health-care directive only if the court appointing
20 the guardian expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation.
21 (b) Unless a court orders otherwise, a health-care decision made by
22 an agent appointed by an individual subject to guardianship prevails over
23 a decision of the guardian appointed for the individual.
24 Sec. 23. (a) A health-care professional or health-care institution
25 acting in good faith is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to
26 discipline for unprofessional conduct for:

28 another person if compliance is based on a reasonable belief that the
29 person has authority to make the decision, including a decision to
30 withhold or withdraw health care;
31 (2) refusing to comply with a health-care decision made for an
-32-
LB66 LB66

3 (3) complying with an advance health-care directive based on a
4 reasonable belief that the directive is valid;
5 (4) refusing to comply with an advance health-care directive based
6 on a reasonable belief that the directive is not valid, including a

8 after its creation, was substantively altered by a person other than the
9 individual who created it;
10 (5) determining that an individual who otherwise might be authorized
11 to act as an agent or default surrogate is not reasonably available; or
12 (6) complying with an individual's direction under subsection (d) of
13 section 9 of this act.
14 (b) An agent, default surrogate, or individual with a reasonable
15 belief that the individual is an agent or a default surrogate is not

18 effort to comply with section 17 of this act.
19 Sec. 24. (a) A person may not:
20 (1) intentionally falsify, in whole or in part, an advance health-
21 care directive;
22 (2) for the purpose of frustrating the intent of the individual who
23 created an advance health-care directive or with knowledge that doing so
24 is likely to frustrate the intent:
25 (A) intentionally conceal, deface, obliterate, or delete the
26 directive or a revocation of the directive without consent of the
27 individual who created or revoked the directive; or
28 (B) intentionally withhold knowledge of the existence or revocation
29 of the directive from a responsible health-care professional or health-

31 revoked the directive;
-33-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 (3) coerce or fraudulently induce an individual to create, revoke,
2 or refrain from creating or revoking an advance health-care directive or

5 health-care directive as a condition for providing health care.
6 (b) An individual who is the subject of conduct prohibited under
7 subsection (a) of this section, or the individual's estate, has a cause
8 of action against a person that violates subsection (a) of this section
9 for statutory damages of twenty-five thousand dollars or actual damages
10 resulting from the violation, whichever is greater.
11 (c) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, an individual who
12 makes a health-care instruction, or the individual's estate, has a cause
13 of action against a health-care professional or health-care institution
14 that intentionally violates section 21 of this act for statutory damages
15 of fifty thousand dollars or actual damages resulting from the violation,
16 whichever is greater.
17 (d) A health-care professional who is an emergency medical responder
18 is not liable under subsection (c) of this section for a violation of
19 subsection (e) of section 21 of this act if:
20 (1) the violation occurs in the course of providing care to an
21 individual experiencing a health condition for which the professional
22 reasonably believes the care was appropriate to avoid imminent loss of
23 life or serious harm to the individual;
24 (2) the failure to comply is consistent with accepted standards of
25 the profession of the professional; and
26 (3) the provision of care does not begin in a health-care
27 institution in which the individual resides or was receiving care.
28 (e) In an action under this section, a prevailing plaintiff may
29 recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other reasonable
30 litigation expenses.
31 (f) A cause of action or remedy under this section is in addition to
-34-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 any cause of action or remedy under other law.
2 Sec. 25. (a) A physical or electronic copy of an advance health-
3 care directive, revocation of an advance health-care directive, or
4 appointment, designation, or disqualification of a surrogate has the same
5 effect as the original.
6 (b) An individual may create a certified physical copy of an advance
7 health-care directive or revocation of an advance health-care directive
8 that is in electronic form by affirming under penalty of perjury that the
9 physical copy is a complete and accurate copy of the directive or
10 revocation.
11 Sec. 26. (a) On petition of an individual, the individual's
12 surrogate, a health-care professional or health-care institution
13 providing health care to the individual, or a person interested in the
14 welfare of the individual, the court may:
15 (1) enjoin implementation of a health-care decision made by an agent
16 or default surrogate on behalf of the individual, on a finding that the
17 decision is inconsistent with section 17 or 18 of this act;
18 (2) enjoin an agent from making a health-care decision for the
19 individual, on a finding that the individual's appointment of the agent
20 has been revoked or the agent:
21 (A) is disqualified under subsection (b) of section 8 of this act;
22 (B) is unwilling or unable to comply with section 17 of this act; or
23 (C) poses a danger to the individual's well-being;
24 (3) enjoin another individual from acting as a default surrogate, on
25 a finding that the other individual acting as a default surrogate did not
26 comply with section 12 of this act or the other individual:
27 (A) is disqualified under section 14 of this act;
28 (B) is unwilling or unable to comply with section 17 of this act; or
29 (C) poses a danger to the first individual's well-being; or

31 (A) by and for the individual; or
-35-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 (B) by an agent or default surrogate who is acting in compliance
2 with the powers and duties of the agent or default surrogate.
3 (b) In the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act, advocacy for the
4 withholding or withdrawal of health care or mental health care from an
5 individual is not itself evidence that an agent or default surrogate, or
6 a potential agent or default surrogate, poses a danger to the
7 individual's well-being.
8 (c) A proceeding under this section is governed by [cite to the
9 state's rules of procedure or statutory provisions governing expedited
10 proceedings and proceedings affecting persons found or alleged to lack
11 capacity].
12 Sec. 27. (a) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not
13 authorize mercy killing, assisted suicide, or euthanasia.
14 (b) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not affect other law
15 of this state governing treatment for mental illness of an individual
16 involuntarily committed for treatment under the Nebraska Mental Health
17 Commitment Act or the Sex Offender Commitment Act.
18 (c) Death of an individual caused by withholding or withdrawing
19 health care in accordance with the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does
20 not constitute a suicide or homicide or legally impair or invalidate a
21 policy of insurance or an annuity providing a death benefit,
22 notwithstanding any term of the policy or annuity.
23 (d) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not create a
24 presumption concerning the intention of an individual who has not created
25 an advance health-care directive.
26 (e) An advance health-care directive created before, on, or after
27 the effective date of this act must be interpreted in accordance with
28 other law of this state, excluding the state's choice-of-law rules, at
29 the time the directive is implemented.
30 Sec. 28. In applying and construing the Uniform Health-Care
31 Decisions Act, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity of the
-36-
LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 law among jurisdictions that enact it.
2 Sec. 29. (a) An advance health-care directive created before the
3 effective date of this act is valid if it complies with the Uniform
4 Health-Care Decisions Act or complied at the time of creation with the
5 law of the state in which it was created.
6 (b) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not affect the
7 validity or effect of an act done before the effective date of this act.
8 (c) An individual who assumed authority to act as default surrogate
9 before the effective date of this act may continue to act as default
10 surrogate until the individual for whom the default surrogate is acting
11 has capacity or the default surrogate is disqualified, whichever occurs
12 first.
13 Sec. 30. The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act applies to an
14 advance health-care directive created before, on, or after the effective
15 date of this act.
16 Sec. 31. If any section in this act or any part of any section is
17 declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect
18 the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.

23 My Agent can do the following things ONLY if I have marked or
24 initialed them below:
25 (....) Admit me as a voluntary patient to a facility for mental
26 health treatment for up to ...... days (write in the number of days you
27 want like 7, 14, 30 or another number).
28 (If I do not mark or initial this choice, my Agent MAY NOT admit me
29 as a voluntary patient to this type of facility.)
30 (....) Place me in a nursing home for more than one hundred days
31 even if my needs can be met somewhere else, I am not terminally ill, and
-18-

LB66 LB66

2 (If I do not mark or initial this choice, my Agent MAY NOT do this.)
3 2. ACCESS TO MY HEALTH INFORMATION
4 My Agent may obtain, examine, and share information about my health

27 has not been appointed or is not reasonably available.
28 (b) Unless the individual has an advance health-care directive that
29 indicates otherwise, a member of the following classes, in descending

2 (1) an adult the individual has identified, other than in a power of
3 attorney for health care, to make a health-care decision for the
4 individual if the individual cannot make the decision;

8 withdrawn;
9 (B) a decree of annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal
10 separation, or termination has been issued;

15 (4) the individual's cohabitant;
16 (5) the individual's adult sibling;
17 (6) the individual's adult grandchild or grandparent;
18 (7) an adult not listed in subdivisions (1) through (6) who has
19 assisted the individual with supported decision making routinely during
20 the preceding six months;
21 (8) the individual's adult stepchild not listed in subdivisions (1)
22 through (7) whom the individual actively parented during the stepchild's

25 exhibited special care and concern for the individual and is familiar
26 with the individual's personal values.
27 (c) A responsible health-care professional may require an individual
28 who assumes authority to act as a default surrogate to provide a
29 declaration in a record under penalty of perjury stating facts and
30 circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the authority.
31 (d) If a responsible health-care professional reasonably determines
-22-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 that an individual who assumed authority to act as a default surrogate is
2 not willing or able to comply with a duty under section 17 of this act or
3 fails to comply with the duty in a timely manner, the professional may
4 recognize the individual next in priority under subsection (b) of this
5 section as the default surrogate.
6 (e) A health-care decision made by a default surrogate is effective
7 without judicial approval.
8 Sec. 13. (a) A default surrogate who assumes authority under
9 section 12 of this act shall inform a responsible health-care
10 professional if two or more members of a class under subsection (b) of
11 section 12 of this act have assumed authority to act as default
12 surrogates and the members do not agree on a health-care decision.
13 (b) A responsible health-care professional shall comply with the
14 decision of a majority of the members of the class with highest priority
15 under subsection (b) of section 12 of this act who have communicated
16 their views to the professional and the professional reasonably believes
17 are acting consistent with their duties under section 17 of this act.
18 (c) If a responsible health-care professional is informed that the
19 members of the class who have communicated their views to the
20 professional are evenly divided concerning the health-care decision, the
21 professional shall make a reasonable effort to solicit the views of
22 members of the class who are reasonably available but have not yet
23 communicated their views to the professional. The professional, after the
24 solicitation, shall comply with the decision of a majority of the members
25 who have communicated their views to the professional and the
26 professional reasonably believes are acting consistent with their duties
27 under section 17 of this act.
28 (d) If the class remains evenly divided after the effort is made
29 under subsection (c) of this section, the health-care decision must be
30 made as provided by other law of this state regarding the treatment of an
31 individual who is found to lack capacity.
-23-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 Sec. 14. (a) An individual for whom a health-care decision would be
2 made may disqualify another individual from acting as default surrogate
3 for the first individual. The disqualification must be in a record signed
4 by the first individual or communicated verbally or nonverbally to the
5 individual being disqualified, another individual, or a responsible
6 health-care professional. Disqualification under this subsection is
7 effective even if made by an individual who lacks capacity to make an
8 advance directive if the individual clearly communicates a desire that
9 the individual being disqualified not make health-care decisions for the
10 individual.
11 (b) An individual is disqualified from acting as a default surrogate
12 for an individual who lacks capacity to make health-care decisions if:
13 (1) a court finds that the potential default surrogate poses a
14 danger to the individual's well-being, even if the court does not issue a
15 protection order against the potential surrogate;
16 (2) the potential default surrogate is an owner, operator, employee,
17 or contractor of a nursing home or an assisted-living facility as defined
18 in section 71-5903 in which the individual is residing or receiving care
19 unless the owner, operator, employee, or contractor is a family member of
20 the individual, the cohabitant of the individual, or a descendant of the
21 cohabitant; or
22 (3) the potential default surrogate refuses to provide a timely
23 declaration under subsection (c) of section 12 of this act.
24 Sec. 15. (a) An individual may revoke the appointment of an agent,
25 the designation of a default surrogate, or a health-care instruction in
26 whole or in part, unless:
27 (1) a court finds the individual lacks capacity to do so;
28 (2) the individual is found under subsection (b) of section 4 of
29 this act to lack capacity to do so and, if the individual objects to the
30 finding, the finding is confirmed under subdivision (d)(4) of section 5
31 of this act; or

2 that includes the provision under subsection (d) of section 9 of this act
3 and the individual is experiencing the psychiatric or psychological event
4 specified in the directive.

6 act of the individual that clearly indicates that the individual intends
7 to revoke the appointment, designation, or instruction, including an oral
8 statement to a health-care professional.
9 (c) Except as provided in section 10 of this act, an advance health-
10 care directive of an individual that conflicts with another advance
11 health-care directive of the individual revokes the earlier directive to
12 the extent of the conflict.
13 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an individual's advance health-care
14 directive appointing an agent, the appointment of a spouse of an
15 individual as agent for the individual is revoked if:
16 (1) a petition for annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage,
17 legal separation, or termination has been filed and not dismissed or
18 withdrawn;
19 (2) a decree of annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal
20 separation, or termination has been issued;
21 (3) the individual and the spouse have agreed in a record to a legal
22 separation; or
23 (4) the spouse has abandoned the individual for more than one year.
24 Sec. 16. (a) An advance health-care directive created outside this
25 state is valid if it complies with:
26 (1) the law of the state specified in the directive or, if a state
27 is not specified, the state in which the individual created the
28 directive; or
29 (2) the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act.
30 (b) A person may assume without inquiry that an advance health-care
31 directive is genuine, valid, and still in effect, and may implement and
-25-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 rely on it, unless the person has good cause to believe the directive is
2 invalid or has been revoked.
3 (c) An advance health-care directive, revocation of a directive, or
4 a signature on a directive or revocation may not be denied legal effect
5 or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.
6 (d) Evidence relating to an advance health-care directive,
7 revocation of a directive, or a signature on a directive or revocation
8 may not be excluded in a proceeding solely because the evidence is in
9 electronic form.
10 (e) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not affect the
11 validity of an electronic record or signature that is valid under the
12 Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
13 (f) If the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act conflicts with other
14 law of this state relating to the creation, execution, implementation, or
15 revocation of an advance health-care directive, the Uniform Health-Care
16 Decisions Act prevails.
17 Sec. 17. (a) An agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary duty to
18 the individual for whom the agent or default surrogate is acting when
19 exercising or purporting to exercise a power under section 18 of this
20 act.
21 (b) An agent or default surrogate shall make a health-care decision
22 in accordance with the direction of the individual in an advance health-
23 care directive and other goals, preferences, and wishes of the individual
24 to the extent known or reasonably ascertainable by the agent or default
25 surrogate.
26 (c) If there is not a direction in an advance health-care directive
27 and the goals, preferences, and wishes of the individual regarding a
28 health-care decision are not known or reasonably ascertainable by the
29 agent or default surrogate, the agent or default surrogate shall make the
30 decision in accordance with the agent's or default surrogate's
31 determination of the individual's best interest.
-26-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 (d) In determining the individual's best interest under subsection
2 (c) of this section, the agent or default surrogate shall:
3 (1) give primary consideration to the individual's contemporaneous
4 communications, including verbal and nonverbal expressions;
5 (2) consider the individual's values to the extent known or
6 reasonably ascertainable by the agent or default surrogate; and
7 (3) consider the risks and benefits of the potential health-care
8 decision.
9 (e) As soon as reasonably feasible, an agent or default surrogate
10 who is informed of a revocation of an advance health-care directive or
11 disqualification of the agent or default surrogate shall communicate the
12 revocation or disqualification to a responsible health-care professional.
13 Sec. 18. (a) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section,
14 the power of an agent or default surrogate commences when the individual
15 is found under subsection (b) of section 4 of this act or by a court to
16 lack capacity to make a health-care decision. The power ceases if the
17 individual later is found to have capacity to make a health-care
18 decision, or the individual objects under subsection (c) of section 5 of
19 this act to the finding of lack of capacity under subsection (b) of
20 section 4 of this act. The power resumes if:
21 (1) the power ceased because the individual objected under
22 subsection (c) of section 5 of this act; and
23 (2) the finding of lack of capacity is confirmed under subdivision
24 (d)(4) of section 5 of this act or a court finds that the individual
25 lacks capacity to make a health-care decision.
26 (b) An agent or default surrogate may request, receive, examine,
27 copy, and consent to the disclosure of medical and other health-care
28 information about the individual if the individual would have the right
29 to request, receive, examine, copy, or consent to the disclosure of the
30 information.
31 (c) A power of attorney for health care may provide that the power
-27-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025

2 appointment.
3 (d) If no other person is authorized to do so, an agent or default
4 surrogate may apply for public or private health insurance and benefits
5 on behalf of the individual. An agent or default surrogate who may apply
6 for insurance and benefits does not, solely by reason of the power, have
7 a duty to apply for the insurance or benefits.
8 (e) An agent or default surrogate may not consent to voluntary
9 admission of the individual to a facility for mental health treatment
10 unless:
11 (1) voluntary admission is specifically authorized by the individual
12 in an advance health-care directive in a record; and
13 (2) the admission is for no more than the maximum of the number of
14 days specified in the directive or [insert the number of days a guardian
15 may commit an adult subject to guardianship without using the state's
16 involuntary commitment procedure], whichever is less.
17 (f) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, an agent
18 or default surrogate may not consent to placement of the individual in a
19 nursing home if the placement is intended to be for more than one hundred
20 days if:
21 (1) an alternative living arrangement is reasonably feasible;
22 (2) the individual objects to the placement; or
23 (3) the individual is not terminally ill.
24 (g) If specifically authorized by the individual in an advance
25 health-care directive in a record, an agent or default surrogate may
26 consent to placement of the individual in a nursing home for more than
27 one hundred days even if:
28 (1) an alternative living arrangement is reasonably feasible;
29 (2) the individual objects to the placement; and
30 (3) the individual is not terminally ill.
31 Sec. 19. (a) If an individual has a long-term disability requiring
-28-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 routine treatment by artificial nutrition, hydration, or mechanical
2 ventilation and a history of using the treatment without objection, an
3 agent or default surrogate may not consent to withhold or withdraw the
4 treatment unless:
5 (1) the treatment is not necessary to sustain the individual's life
6 or maintain the individual's well-being;
7 (2) the individual has expressly authorized the withholding or
8 withdrawal in a health-care instruction that has not been revoked; or
9 (3) the individual has experienced a major reduction in health or
10 functional ability from which the individual is not expected to recover,
11 even with other appropriate treatment, and the individual has not:
12 (A) given a direction inconsistent with withholding or withdrawal;
13 or
14 (B) communicated by verbal or nonverbal expression a desire for
15 artificial nutrition, hydration, or mechanical ventilation.
16 (b) A default surrogate may not make a health-care decision if,
17 under other law of this state, the decision:
18 (1) may not be made by a guardian; or
19 (2) may be made by a guardian only if the court appointing the
20 guardian specifically authorizes the guardian to make the decision.
21 Sec. 20. (a) An individual in a power of attorney for health care
22 may appoint multiple individuals as co-agents. Unless the power of
23 attorney provides otherwise, each co-agent may exercise independent
24 authority.
25 (b) An individual in a power of attorney for health care may appoint
26 one or more individuals to act as alternate agents if a predecessor agent
27 resigns, dies, becomes disqualified, is not reasonably available, or
28 otherwise is unwilling or unable to act as agent.
29 (c) Unless the power of attorney provides otherwise, an alternate
30 agent has the same authority as the original agent:
31 (1) at any time the original agent is not reasonably available or is
-29-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 otherwise unwilling or unable to act, for the duration of the
2 unavailability, unwillingness, or inability to act; or
3 (2) if the original agent and all other predecessor agents have
4 resigned or died or are disqualified from acting as agent.
5 Sec. 21. (a) A responsible health-care professional who is aware
6 that an individual has been found to lack capacity to make a decision
7 shall make a reasonable effort to determine if the individual has a
8 surrogate.
9 (b) If possible before implementing a health-care decision made by a
10 surrogate, a responsible health-care professional as soon as reasonably
11 feasible shall communicate to the individual the decision made and the
12 identity of the surrogate.
13 (c) A responsible health-care professional who makes or is informed
14 of a finding that an individual lacks capacity to make a health-care
15 decision or no longer lacks capacity, or that other circumstances exist
16 that affect a health-care instruction or the authority of a surrogate, as
17 soon as reasonably feasible, shall:
18 (1) document the finding or circumstance in the individual's medical
19 record; and
20 (2) if possible, communicate to the individual and the individual's
21 surrogate the finding or circumstance and that the individual may object
22 under subsection (c) of section 5 of this act to the finding under
23 subsection (b) of section 4 of this act.
24 (d) A responsible health-care professional who is informed that an
25 individual has created or revoked an advance health-care directive, or
26 that a surrogate for an individual has been appointed, designated, or
27 disqualified, shall:
28 (1) document the information as soon as reasonably feasible in the
29 individual's medical record; and
30 (2) if evidence of the directive, revocation, appointment,
31 designation, or disqualification is in a record, request a copy and, on
-30-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025

2 record.
3 (e) Except as provided in subsections (f) and (g) of this section, a
4 health-care professional or health-care institution providing health care
5 to an individual shall comply with:
6 (1) a health-care instruction given by the individual regarding the
7 individual's health care;
8 (2) a reasonable interpretation by the individual's surrogate of an
9 instruction given by the individual; and
10 (3) a health-care decision for the individual made by the
11 individual's surrogate in accordance with sections 17 and 18 of this act
12 to the same extent as if the decision had been made by the individual at
13 a time when the individual had capacity.
14 (f) A health-care professional or a health-care institution may
15 refuse to provide health care consistent with a health-care instruction
16 or health-care decision if:
17 (1) the instruction or decision is contrary to a policy of the
18 health-care institution providing care to the individual that is based
19 expressly on reasons of conscience and the policy was timely communicated
20 to the individual or to the individual's surrogate;
21 (2) the care would require health care that is not available to the
22 professional or institution; or
23 (3) compliance with the instruction or decision would:
24 (A) require the professional to provide care that is contrary to the
25 professional's religious belief or moral conviction if other law permits
26 the professional to refuse to provide care for that reason;
27 (B) require the professional or institution to provide care that is
28 contrary to generally accepted health-care standards applicable to the
29 professional or institution; or
30 (C) violate a court order or other law.
31 (g) A health-care professional or health-care institution that
-31-

LB66 LB66

18 Sec. 22. (a) A guardian may refuse to comply with or revoke the
19 individual's advance health-care directive only if the court appointing
20 the guardian expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation.
21 (b) Unless a court orders otherwise, a health-care decision made by
22 an agent appointed by an individual subject to guardianship prevails over
23 a decision of the guardian appointed for the individual.

25 acting in good faith is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to
26 discipline for unprofessional conduct for:

9 individual who created it;
10 (5) determining that an individual who otherwise might be authorized

10 resulting from the violation, whichever is greater.
11 (c) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, an individual who

16 whichever is greater.
17 (d) A health-care professional who is an emergency medical responder
18 is not liable under subsection (c) of this section for a violation of
19 subsection (e) of section 21 of this act if:
20 (1) the violation occurs in the course of providing care to an
21 individual experiencing a health condition for which the professional

23 life or serious harm to the individual;
24 (2) the failure to comply is consistent with accepted standards of

30 litigation expenses.

LB66 LB66
2025 2025

2 Sec. 25. (a) A physical or electronic copy of an advance health-

4 appointment, designation, or disqualification of a surrogate has the same
5 effect as the original.
6 (b) An individual may create a certified physical copy of an advance
7 health-care directive or revocation of an advance health-care directive
8 that is in electronic form by affirming under penalty of perjury that the
9 physical copy is a complete and accurate copy of the directive or
10 revocation.
11 Sec. 26. (a) On petition of an individual, the individual's
12 surrogate, a health-care professional or health-care institution
13 providing health care to the individual, or a person interested in the
14 welfare of the individual, the court may:
15 (1) enjoin implementation of a health-care decision made by an agent

17 decision is inconsistent with section 17 or 18 of this act;
18 (2) enjoin an agent from making a health-care decision for the
19 individual, on a finding that the individual's appointment of the agent
20 has been revoked or the agent:
21 (A) is disqualified under subsection (b) of section 8 of this act;
22 (B) is unwilling or unable to comply with section 17 of this act; or
23 (C) poses a danger to the individual's well-being;

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 (B) by an agent or default surrogate who is acting in compliance
2 with the powers and duties of the agent or default surrogate.
3 (b) In the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act, advocacy for the
4 withholding or withdrawal of health care or mental health care from an
5 individual is not itself evidence that an agent or default surrogate, or
6 a potential agent or default surrogate, poses a danger to the
7 individual's well-being.
8 (c) A proceeding under this section is governed by [cite to the
9 state's rules of procedure or statutory provisions governing expedited
10 proceedings and proceedings affecting persons found or alleged to lack
11 capacity].
12 Sec. 27. (a) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not
13 authorize mercy killing, assisted suicide, or euthanasia.

15 of this state governing treatment for mental illness of an individual
16 involuntarily committed for treatment under the Nebraska Mental Health
17 Commitment Act or the Sex Offender Commitment Act.
18 (c) Death of an individual caused by withholding or withdrawing
19 health care in accordance with the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does
20 not constitute a suicide or homicide or legally impair or invalidate a
21 policy of insurance or an annuity providing a death benefit,
22 notwithstanding any term of the policy or annuity.
23 (d) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not create a
24 presumption concerning the intention of an individual who has not created
25 an advance health-care directive.
26 (e) An advance health-care directive created before, on, or after
27 the effective date of this act must be interpreted in accordance with
28 other law of this state, excluding the state's choice-of-law rules, at
29 the time the directive is implemented.
30 Sec. 28. In applying and construing the Uniform Health-Care
31 Decisions Act, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity of the
-36-

LB66 LB66
2025 2025
1 law among jurisdictions that enact it.
2 Sec. 29. (a) An advance health-care directive created before the
3 effective date of this act is valid if it complies with the Uniform
4 Health-Care Decisions Act or complied at the time of creation with the
5 law of the state in which it was created.
6 (b) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act does not affect the
7 validity or effect of an act done before the effective date of this act.
8 (c) An individual who assumed authority to act as default surrogate
9 before the effective date of this act may continue to act as default
10 surrogate until the individual for whom the default surrogate is acting
11 has capacity or the default surrogate is disqualified, whichever occurs
12 first.
13 Sec. 30. The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act applies to an
14 advance health-care directive created before, on, or after the effective
15 date of this act.
16 Sec. 31. If any section in this act or any part of any section is
17 declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect
18 the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.
