is familiar with the procedures and rules of the State Fire Marshal relating to
water-based fire protection systems. If the responsible managing employee
passes the examination, the State Fire Marshal shall issue the certificate to
the water-based fire protection system contractor within thirty days.
(4) A certificate shall expire on September 30 of the year following
issuance. An application for renewal shall be filed at least ten days prior to
expiration and shall be accompanied by a renewal fee of up to two one hundred
dollars and a sworn affidavit that the responsible managing employee is
currently employed by the water-based fire protection system contractor. A
water-based fire protection system contractor who fails to apply for renewal
within the time stated in this subsection must make a new application for a
certificate.
(5) A responsible managing employee may only act as such for one water-
based fire protection system contractor at a time. When a responsible managing
employee terminates his or her association with a water-based fire protection
system contractor, the water-based fire protection system contractor shall
notify the State Fire Marshal within thirty days after termination. The
responsible managing employee shall not be designated as the responsible
managing employee for more than two water-based fire protection system
contractors in any twelve-month period. The State Fire Marshal shall revoke the
certificate of a water-based fire protection system contractor whose
responsible managing employee has terminated his or her association with the
water-based fire protection system contractor unless an application designating
a new responsible managing employee is filed within six months after
termination or prior to expiration of the current certificate, whichever is
earlier.

registration shall specify the ownership of, location of, and substance stored
in the tank to be registered. The State Fire Marshal shall remit the fee to the
State Treasurer for credit to the Petroleum Products and Hazardous Substances
Storage and Handling Fund which is hereby created as a cash fund. The fund

Handling Act, including the provision of matching funds required by Public Law
99-499 for actions otherwise authorized by the act. Any money in such fund

five fifty dollars. The State Fire Marshal shall remit the fee to the State

tank. The State Fire Marshal shall remit the fee to the State Treasurer for
credit to the Underground Storage Tank Fund. Such permits shall contain the
information specified in subsection (5) of this section.
(4) In the case of tanks permanently abandoned on or after January 1,
1974, an annual permit shall not be required and an initial registration permit
shall be sufficient.
(5) The application for a registration permit shall be provided by and
filed with the State Fire Marshal's office and shall require, but not be
limited to, the following information:
(a) The date the tank was placed in or taken out of operation;
(b) The age of the tank;
(c) The size, type, and location of the tank; and
