7 not to exceed the actual costs for the performance of services by the

11 Marshal shall hold a public hearing on the question of the adoption of or
12 change in fees. Notice of such hearing shall be given at least thirty
13 days prior thereto (a) by publication in a newspaper having general
14 circulation in the state and (b) by notifying in writing the head of any

17 Marshal shall be paid to the State Fire Marshal and shall be remitted to
18 the State Treasurer for credit to the State Fire Marshal Cash Fund. Fees
19 for services performed by local fire prevention personnel shall be paid
20 directly to the office of the local fire prevention personnel.

24 reviewing plans, blueprints, and shop drawings to determine compliance
25 with the accessibility standards and specifications adopted pursuant to
26 section 81-5,147, except that the additional fee assessed pursuant to

5 period. The State Fire Marshal shall revoke the certificate of a water-
6 based fire protection system contractor whose responsible managing
7 employee has terminated his or her association with the water-based fire
8 protection system contractor unless an application designating a new
9 responsible managing employee is filed within six months after

11 is earlier.
