22 Security, Form I-766, and (ii) documentation issued by the United States

2025 2025
1 the requirements to obtain a professional or commercial license that are
2 unrelated to the lawful presence requirements demonstrated pursuant to
3 this subsection.
4 (c) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant
5 eligibility for any public benefits other than obtaining a professional
6 or commercial license.
7 (d) Any person who has complied with the requirements of this
8 subsection shall have his or her employment authorization document

21 Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program operated by the
22 United States Department of Homeland Security or an equivalent program
23 designated by the United States Department of Homeland Security.

18 in the retirement system solely because such employee also maintains
19 separate employment which qualifies the employee for membership in
20 another public retirement system, nor may membership in this retirement
21 system disqualify such an employee from membership in another public
22 retirement system solely by reason of separate employment which qualifies
