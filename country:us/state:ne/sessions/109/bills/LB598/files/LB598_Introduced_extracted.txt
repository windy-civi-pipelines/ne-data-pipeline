1 Section 1. (1) On or before January 15 of each school fiscal year,
2 a school district with expected expenditures for limited English
3 proficiency students that total (a) at least fifty thousand dollars
4 annually or (b) one-half percent or more of such school district's annual
5 budget, whichever is greater, may submit an application as prescribed by
6 the Commissioner of Education to the State Department of Education for a
7 payment from the Education Future Fund to cover an extraordinary increase
8 in limited English proficiency student expenditures pursuant to the
9 requirements of this section.
10 (2) Such application shall include the limited English proficiency
11 student expenditures of the applicant school district as of the
12 immediately preceding December 31 for the school fiscal year in which the
13 application is submitted.
14 (3) The department shall divide the limited English proficiency
15 student expenditures for the school fiscal year immediately preceding the
16 school fiscal year in which an application is submitted by two and
17 multiply the result by one hundred seven percent for each applicant
18 school district.
19 (4) Each applicant school district shall qualify for a maximum
20 payment equal to the difference of the limited English proficiency
21 student expenditures for the current school fiscal year submitted
22 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section minus the amount calculated
23 pursuant to subsection (3) of this section for such school district for
24 such school fiscal year.
25 (5) The department shall make a payment to each applicant school
26 district on or before January 31 for the school fiscal year in which the
27 application is submitted. Such payment shall equal the maximum payment
28 determined pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, except that if the
29 sum of all maximum payments for applicant school districts for such
30 school fiscal year exceeds the available balance for such purpose in the
31 Education Future Fund, each payment shall be reduced proportionally so
-2-

2 school fiscal year equals the available balance for such purpose in the
3 fund.
4 Sec. 2. Section 79-1007.15, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 79-1007.15 (1) For school fiscal year 2008-09, the department shall
7 calculate an elementary site allowance for any district in which (a) the
8 district has more than one elementary attendance site, (b) at least one
9 of the elementary attendance sites does not offer any other grades, (c)
10 the square miles in the district divided by the number of elementary
11 attendance sites in the district equals one hundred square miles or more
12 per elementary attendance site, and (d) the fall membership in elementary
13 site grades in the district divided by the number of elementary site
14 grades then divided again by the number of elementary attendance sites
15 equals fifteen or fewer students per grade per elementary attendance
16 site. Qualifying elementary attendance sites for such districts shall
17 only offer elementary site grades and shall have an average of fifteen or
18 fewer students per grade in the fall membership.
19 (2) For school fiscal year 2009-10 and each school fiscal year
20 thereafter, the department shall calculate an elementary site allowance
21 for any district which has at least one qualifying elementary attendance
22 site and which submits the information required for the calculation on a
23 form prescribed by the department on or before October 15 of the school
24 fiscal year preceding the school fiscal year for which aid is being
25 calculated. A qualifying elementary attendance site shall be an
26 elementary attendance site, in a district with multiple elementary
27 attendance sites, which does not have another elementary attendance site
28 within seven miles in the same school district or which is the only
29 public elementary attendance site located in an incorporated city or
30 village.

-3-
LB598 LB598
2025 2025
1 district shall equal the sum of the elementary site allowances for each
2 qualifying elementary attendance site in the district. The elementary
3 site allowance for each qualifying elementary attendance site shall equal
4 five hundred percent of the statewide average general fund operating
5 expenditures per formula student multiplied by the result of rounding the
6 ratio of the fall membership attributed to the elementary attendance site
7 divided by eight up to the next whole number if the result was not a
8 whole number, except that if the resulting whole number is greater than
9 the number of elementary site grades, the whole number shall be reduced
10 to equal the number of elementary site grades.
11 (b) An elementary attendance site that provides at least sixty
12 minutes of planning time per school day to its elementary school teachers
13 shall qualify for an additional funding allowance as part of the
14 elementary site allowance equal to one hundred percent of the statewide
15 average general fund operating expenditures per formula student
16 multiplied by the ratio of the fall membership attributed to the
17 elementary attendance site divided by eight.
18 (4) For purposes of this section:
19 (a) Each district shall determine which grades are considered
20 elementary site grades, except that (i) all grades designated as
21 elementary site grades shall be offered in each elementary attendance
22 site in the district, without any preference indicated by the school
23 board or any school district administrator for students to attend
24 different elementary attendance sites depending on their elementary site
25 grade level, for the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated
26 and for each of the five school fiscal years preceding the school fiscal

1 site to which the most formula students are attributed in the district
2 and shall not be a qualifying elementary attendance site; and
3 (d) Fall membership means the fall membership for the school fiscal
4 year immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which aid is being
5 calculated.
6 (5) If the elementary attendance site is new or is being reopened
7 after being closed for at least one school year, the requirements of
8 subdivision (4)(a)(i) of this section with respect to preceding school
9 fiscal years shall not apply to school fiscal years in which the
10 elementary attendance site was not in operation.
11 (6) The department shall determine if the qualifications for the
12 elementary site allowance have been met for each elementary attendance
13 site for which information has been submitted. The department may rely on
14 the information submitted and any other information available to the
15 department, including, but not limited to, past attendance patterns. The
16 state board shall establish a procedure for appeal of decisions of the
17 department to the state board for a final determination.

2025 2025
1 Section 1. (1) On or before January 15 of each school fiscal year,
2 a school district with expected expenditures for limited English
3 proficiency students that total (a) at least fifty thousand dollars
4 annually or (b) one-half percent or more of such school district's annual
5 budget, whichever is greater, may submit an application as prescribed by
6 the Commissioner of Education to the State Department of Education for a
7 payment from the Education Future Fund to cover an extraordinary increase
8 in limited English proficiency student expenditures pursuant to the
9 requirements of this section.
10 (2) Such application shall include the limited English proficiency
11 student expenditures of the applicant school district as of the
12 immediately preceding December 31 for the school fiscal year in which the
13 application is submitted.
14 (3) The department shall divide the limited English proficiency
15 student expenditures for the school fiscal year immediately preceding the
16 school fiscal year in which an application is submitted by two and
17 multiply the result by one hundred seven percent for each applicant
18 school district.
19 (4) Each applicant school district shall qualify for a maximum
20 payment equal to the difference of the limited English proficiency
21 student expenditures for the current school fiscal year submitted
22 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section minus the amount calculated
23 pursuant to subsection (3) of this section for such school district for
24 such school fiscal year.
25 (5) The department shall make a payment to each applicant school
26 district on or before January 31 for the school fiscal year in which the
27 application is submitted. Such payment shall equal the maximum payment
28 determined pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, except that if the
29 sum of all maximum payments for applicant school districts for such
30 school fiscal year exceeds the available balance for such purpose in the
31 Education Future Fund, each payment shall be reduced proportionally so
-2-

LB598 LB598
2025 2025
1 that the sum of all payments for applicant school districts for such
2 school fiscal year equals the available balance for such purpose in the
3 fund.
4 Sec. 2. Section 79-1007.15, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 79-1007.15 (1) For school fiscal year 2008-09, the department shall
7 calculate an elementary site allowance for any district in which (a) the
8 district has more than one elementary attendance site, (b) at least one
9 of the elementary attendance sites does not offer any other grades, (c)
10 the square miles in the district divided by the number of elementary
11 attendance sites in the district equals one hundred square miles or more
12 per elementary attendance site, and (d) the fall membership in elementary
13 site grades in the district divided by the number of elementary site
14 grades then divided again by the number of elementary attendance sites
15 equals fifteen or fewer students per grade per elementary attendance
16 site. Qualifying elementary attendance sites for such districts shall
17 only offer elementary site grades and shall have an average of fifteen or
18 fewer students per grade in the fall membership.
19 (2) For school fiscal year 2009-10 and each school fiscal year
20 thereafter, the department shall calculate an elementary site allowance
21 for any district which has at least one qualifying elementary attendance
22 site and which submits the information required for the calculation on a
23 form prescribed by the department on or before October 15 of the school
24 fiscal year preceding the school fiscal year for which aid is being
25 calculated. A qualifying elementary attendance site shall be an
26 elementary attendance site, in a district with multiple elementary
27 attendance sites, which does not have another elementary attendance site
28 within seven miles in the same school district or which is the only
29 public elementary attendance site located in an incorporated city or
30 village.
31 (3)(a) (3) The elementary site allowance for each qualifying
-3-

LB598 LB598
2025 2025
1 district shall equal the sum of the elementary site allowances for each
2 qualifying elementary attendance site in the district. The elementary
3 site allowance for each qualifying elementary attendance site shall equal
4 five hundred percent of the statewide average general fund operating
5 expenditures per formula student multiplied by the result of rounding the
6 ratio of the fall membership attributed to the elementary attendance site
7 divided by eight up to the next whole number if the result was not a
8 whole number, except that if the resulting whole number is greater than
9 the number of elementary site grades, the whole number shall be reduced
10 to equal the number of elementary site grades.
11 (b) An elementary attendance site that provides at least sixty
12 minutes of planning time per school day to its elementary school teachers
13 shall qualify for an additional funding allowance as part of the
14 elementary site allowance equal to one hundred percent of the statewide
15 average general fund operating expenditures per formula student
16 multiplied by the ratio of the fall membership attributed to the
17 elementary attendance site divided by eight.
18 (4) For purposes of this section:
19 (a) Each district shall determine which grades are considered
20 elementary site grades, except that (i) all grades designated as
21 elementary site grades shall be offered in each elementary attendance
22 site in the district, without any preference indicated by the school
23 board or any school district administrator for students to attend
24 different elementary attendance sites depending on their elementary site
25 grade level, for the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated
26 and for each of the five school fiscal years preceding the school fiscal
27 year for which aid is being calculated and (ii) elementary site grades
28 shall not include grades nine, ten, eleven, or twelve;
29 (b) An elementary attendance site is an attendance site in which
30 elementary site grades are offered;
31 (c) The primary elementary site shall be the elementary attendance
-4-

2025 2025
1 site to which the most formula students are attributed in the district
2 and shall not be a qualifying elementary attendance site; and
3 (d) Fall membership means the fall membership for the school fiscal
4 year immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which aid is being
5 calculated.
6 (5) If the elementary attendance site is new or is being reopened
7 after being closed for at least one school year, the requirements of
8 subdivision (4)(a)(i) of this section with respect to preceding school
9 fiscal years shall not apply to school fiscal years in which the
10 elementary attendance site was not in operation.
11 (6) The department shall determine if the qualifications for the
12 elementary site allowance have been met for each elementary attendance
13 site for which information has been submitted. The department may rely on
14 the information submitted and any other information available to the
15 department, including, but not limited to, past attendance patterns. The
16 state board shall establish a procedure for appeal of decisions of the
17 department to the state board for a final determination.
18 Sec. 3. Section 79-1021, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 79-1021 (1) The Education Future Fund is created. The fund shall be
21 administered by the department and shall consist of money transferred to
22 the fund by the Legislature. Transfers may be made from the Education
23 Future Fund to the Computer Science and Technology Education Fund at the
24 direction of the Legislature. Any money in the Education Future Fund
25 available for investment shall be invested by the state investment
26 officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska
27 State Funds Investment Act.
