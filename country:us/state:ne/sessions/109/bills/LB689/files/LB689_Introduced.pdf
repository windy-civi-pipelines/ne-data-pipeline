LB689 LB689
2025 2025
1 by the member; and (b) any contributions made to a previously existing
2 system which were refundable under the terms of that system. Any member
3 receiving a refund of contributions shall thereby forfeit and relinquish
4 all accrued rights in the retirement system including all accumulated
5 creditable service, except that if any member who has withdrawn his or
6 her contributions as provided in this section reenters the service of the
7 district and again becomes a member of the retirement system, he or she

12 and he or she shall then again receive credit for that portion of service
13 which the restored money represents. Such restoration may be made as the
14 board may direct until September 1, 2024, and as the retirement board may
15 direct beginning September 1, 2024, through direct payments to the system
16 or on an installment basis pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll
17 deduction authorized between the member and the school district over a
18 period of not to exceed five years from the date of reemployment.
19 Interest on delayed payments shall be at the rate of interest for
20 determining interest on delayed payments by members to the retirement
21 system. Creditable service may be purchased only in one-tenth-year
22 increments, starting with the most recent years' salary.
23 (2) Except as provided in section 79-992.01:
24 (a)(i) A retired member, or a member described in subdivision (2)(c)
25 or (d) of this subsection, who returns to employment as or again becomes

1 employee of the school district shall receive creditable service only for
2 service performed after his or her return to employment and in no event
3 shall creditable service which accrues or the compensation paid to the

5 amount of the member's original retirement annuity;
6 (b) Upon termination of employment of the reemployed member, the
7 member shall receive in addition to the retirement annuity which
8 commenced at the time of the previous retirement (i) if the member has
9 accrued five years or more of creditable service after his or her return
10 to employment, excluding years of prior service acquired pursuant to
11 section 79-990, 79-991, 79-994, 79-995, or 79-997, a retirement annuity
12 as provided in section 79-999 or 79-9,100, as applicable, calculated
13 solely on the basis of creditable service and final average compensation
14 accrued and earned after the member's return to employment after his or
15 her original retirement, and as adjusted to reflect any payment in other
16 than the normal form or (ii) if the member has not accrued five years or
17 more of creditable service after his or her return to employment, a
18 refund equal to the member's accumulated contributions which were
19 credited to the member after the member's return to employment. In no
20 event shall the member's creditable service which accrued prior to a
21 previous retirement be considered as part of the member's creditable
22 service after his or her return to employment for any purpose of the
23 Class V School Employees Retirement Act;
24 (c) A member who experiences a separation from service but has not
25 submitted a retirement application or request for distribution pursuant
26 to this section or as described in subdivision (32) of section 79-978, or
27 received a retirement benefit, disability retirement benefit, or refund
28 may return to work as a temporary employee, substitute employee, or
29 volunteer. Such a temporary employee, substitute employee, or volunteer:
