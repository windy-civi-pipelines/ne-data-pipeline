warrants and acts relating to disposition of seized property in circumstances
for which special provision is made. The term property is used in sections
29-812 to 29-821 to include documents, books, papers, and any other tangible
objects, and controllable electronic records as defined in section 8-3003.
Nothing in sections 29-812 to 29-821 shall be construed as restricting or in
any way affecting the constitutional right of any officer to make reasonable
searches and seizures as an incident to a lawful arrest nor to restrict or in
any way affect reasonable searches and seizures authorized or consented to by

any other manner or way authorized or permitted to be made under the
Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of
Nebraska.
All search warrants shall be issued with all practicable secrecy and the

a criminal contempt of court.
Sec. 14. If any section in this act or any part of any section is
declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect the
validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.
Sec. 15. Original section 29-817, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
