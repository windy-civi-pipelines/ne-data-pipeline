Sec. 12. Section 48-648, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
48-648 (1) With respect to wages for employment, combined tax shall accrue
and become payable by each employer not otherwise entitled to make payments in
lieu of contributions for each calendar year in which he or she is subject to
the Employment Security Law. Such combined tax shall become due and be paid by
each employer to the commissioner for the Workforce Development Program Cash
State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund and the Unemployment Trust Fund in such
manner and at such times as the commissioner may, by rule and regulation,
prescribe. Such combined tax shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from
the wages of individuals in such employer's employ.
(2) The commissioner may require any employer whose annual payroll for
either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or exceeded one hundred
thousand dollars to file combined tax returns and pay combined taxes owed by an
electronic method approved by the commissioner, except when the employer
establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that filing the combined
tax return or payment of the tax by an electronic method would create a
hardship for the employer.
(3) In the payment of any combined tax, a fractional part of a cent shall
be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it
shall be increased to one cent. If the combined tax due for any reporting
period is less than five dollars, the employer need not remit the combined tax.
(4) If two or more related corporations or limited liability companies
concurrently employ the same individual and compensate such individual through
a common paymaster which is one of such corporations or limited liability
companies, each such corporation or limited liability company shall be
considered to have paid as remuneration to such individual only the amounts
actually disbursed by it to such individual and shall not be considered to have
paid as remuneration to such individual amounts actually disbursed to such
individual by another of such corporations or limited liability companies. An
employee of a wholly owned subsidiary shall be considered to be concurrently
employed by the parent corporation, company, or other entity and the wholly
owned subsidiary whether or not both companies separately provide remuneration.
(5) The professional employer organization shall report and pay combined
tax, penalties, and interest owed for wages earned by worksite employees under
the client's employer account number using the client's combined tax rate. The
client is liable for the payment of unpaid combined tax, penalties, and
interest owed for wages paid to worksite employees, and the worksite employees
shall be considered employees of the client for purposes of the Employment
Security Law.
(6) The Commissioner of Labor may require by rule and regulation that each
employer subject to the Employment Security Law shall submit to the
commissioner quarterly wage reports on such forms and in such manner as the
commissioner may prescribe. The commissioner may require any employer whose
annual payroll for either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or
exceeded one hundred thousand dollars to file wage reports by an electronic
method approved by the commissioner, except when the employer establishes to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that filing by an electronic method would
create a hardship for the employer. The quarterly wage reports shall be used by
the commissioner to make monetary determinations of claims for benefits.
Sec. 13. Section 48-649.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
48-649.01 (1) By December 1 of each calendar year, the commissioner shall
determine the state unemployment insurance tax rate for the following year
based on information available through the department. The state unemployment
insurance tax rate shall be zero percent if:
(a) The average balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund at
the end of any three months in the preceding calendar year is greater than one
percent of state taxable wages for the same preceding year; or
(b) The balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund equals or
exceeds thirty percent of the average month end balance of the state's account
in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the three lowest calendar months in the
preceding year.
(2) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is determined to be zero
percent pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the contribution rate for
all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined tax rate.
(3) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is not zero percent as
determined in this section, the combined tax rate shall be divided so that not
less than eighty percent of the combined tax rate equals the contribution rate
and not more than twenty percent of the combined tax rate equals the state
unemployment insurance tax rate except for employers who are assigned a
combined tax rate of five and four-tenths percent or more. For those employers,
the state unemployment insurance tax rate shall equal zero and their combined
tax rate shall equal their contribution rate.
Sec. 14. Section 48-649.03, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
48-649.03 (1) Once benefits have been payable from and chargeable to an
-7-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
employer's experience account throughout the preceding four calendar quarters
and wages for employment have been paid by the employer in each of the two
preceding four-calendar-quarter periods, the employer's combined tax rate shall
be calculated according to this section. The combined tax rate shall be based
upon the employer's experience rating record and determined from the employer's
reserve ratio.
(2) The employer's reserve ratio is the percent obtained by dividing (a)
the amount by which the employer's contributions credited from the time the
employer first or most recently became an employer, whichever date is later,
and up to and including September 30 of the year the rate computation is made,
plus any part of the employer's contributions due for that year paid on or
before October 31 of such year, exceed the employer's benefits charged during
the same period, by (b) the employer's average annual taxable payroll for the
sixteen-consecutive-calendar-quarter period ending September 30 of the year in
which the rate computation is made. For an employer with less than sixteen
consecutive calendar quarters of contribution experience, the employer's
average taxable payroll shall be determined based upon the four-calendar-
quarter periods for which contributions were payable.
(3) Each eligible experience rated employer shall be assigned to one of
twenty rate categories with a corresponding experience factor as follows:
Category Experience Factor
1 0.00
2 0.25
3 0.40
4 0.45
5 0.50
6 0.60
7 0.65
8 0.70
9 0.80
10 0.90
11 0.95
12 1.00
13 1.05
14 1.10
15 1.20
16 1.35
17 1.55
18 1.80
19 2.15
20 2.60
Eligible experience rated employers shall be assigned to rate categories
from highest to lowest according to their experience reserve ratio, with
category one assigned to accounts with the highest reserve ratios and category
twenty assigned to accounts with the lowest reserve ratios. Each category shall
be limited to no more than five percent of the state's total taxable payroll,
except that:
(a) Any employer with a portion of its taxable wages falling into two
consecutive categories shall be assigned to the lower category;
(b) No employer with a reserve ratio calculated to five decimal places
equal to the similarly calculated reserve ratio of another employer shall be
assigned to a higher rate than the employer to which it has the equal reserve
ratio; and
(c) No employer with a positive experience account balance shall be
assigned to category twenty.
(4) The state's reserve ratio shall be calculated annually by dividing the
amount available to pay benefits in the Unemployment Trust Fund and the State
Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund as of September 30, plus any amount of
combined tax owed by employers eligible for and electing annual payment status
for the four most recent quarters ending on September 30 in accordance with
-8-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner, by the state's total wages
from the four calendar quarters ending on September 30. For purposes of this

Section 4:
section, total wages means all remuneration paid by an employer in employment.
The state's reserve ratio shall be applied to the table in this subsection to
determine the yield factor for the upcoming rate year.
State's Reserve Ratio Yield Factor

Section 5:
1.75 percent and above = 0.50

Section 6:
1.60 percent up to but not including 1.75 = 0.60

Section 7:
1.45 percent up to but not including 1.60 = 0.70

Section 8:
1.30 percent up to but not including 1.45 = 0.75

Section 9:
1.15 percent up to but not including 1.30 = 0.80

Section 10:
1.00 percent up to but not including 1.15 = 0.90

Section 11:
0.85 percent up to but not including 1.00 = 1.00

Section 12:
0.70 percent up to but not including 0.85 = 1.10

Section 13:
0.60 percent up to but not including 0.70 = 1.20

Section 14:
0.50 percent up to but not including 0.60 = 1.25

Section 15:
0.45 percent up to but not including 0.50 = 1.30

Section 16:
0.40 percent up to but not including 0.45 = 1.35

Section 17:
0.35 percent up to but not including 0.40 = 1.40

Section 18:
0.30 percent up to but not including 0.35 = 1.45
Below 0.30 percent = 1.50
The commissioner may adjust the yield factor determined pursuant to the
preceding table to a lower scheduled yield factor if the state's reserve ratio
is 1.00 percent or greater. Once the yield factor for the upcoming rate year
has been determined, it is multiplied by the amount of unemployment benefits
paid from combined tax during the four calendar quarters ending September 30 of
the preceding year. The resulting figure is the planned yield for the rate
year. The planned yield is divided by the total taxable wages for the four
calendar quarters ending September 30 of the previous year and carried to four
decimal places to create the average combined tax rate for the rate year.
Beginning January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2029, the final average
combined tax rate shall be reduced by five percent.
(5) The average combined tax rate is assigned to rate category twelve as
established in subsection (3) of this section. Rates for each of the remaining
nineteen categories are determined by multiplying the average combined tax rate
by the experience factor associated with each category and carried to four
decimal places. Employers who are delinquent in filing their combined tax
reports as of October 31 of any year shall be assigned to category twenty for
the following calendar year unless the delinquency is corrected prior to
December 31 of the year of rate calculation.
(6) In addition to required contributions, an employer may make voluntary
contributions to the fund to be credited to his or her account. Voluntary
contributions by employers may be made up to the amount necessary to qualify
for one rate category reduction. Voluntary contributions received after
February 28 shall not be used in rate calculations for the same calendar year.
(7) As used in sections 48-648 to 48-654, the term payroll means the total
amount of wages during a calendar year, except as otherwise provided in section
48-654, by which the combined tax was measured.
Sec. 15. Section 48-657, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
48-657 (1)(a) If any employer defaults in any payment of combined tax or
interest, the commissioner may make in any manner feasible and cause to be
filed as a secured transaction as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial
Code, and in the real estate mortgage records of any county in which such
employer is engaged in business or owns real or personal property, a statement,
under oath, showing the amount of combined tax and interest in default, which
statement, when filed for record, shall operate as a lien and mortgage on all
of the real and personal property of the employer, subject only to the liens of
prior record, and the property of such employer shall be subject to seizure and
sale for the payment of such combined taxes and interest. Such lien on personal
property may be enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by article 9,
Uniform Commercial Code, and such liens on real estate may be enforced or
dissolved in the manner provided by Chapter 25, article 21, in the enforcing
and dissolving of real estate mortgages. This subdivision shall only apply to
liens filed prior to May 1, 1999.

(b) A lien for unpaid combined taxes filed or recorded pursuant to
subdivision (a) of this subsection shall lapse at the earlier of its expiration
date or the fifth anniversary of the filing or recording date, unless the
commissioner files a notice of continuation in the place of the original filing
or recording and with the appropriate filing officer in the manner provided for
in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and Enforcement Act before such lien
lapses. A notice of continuation shall include all of the information required
by the act, the date of the filing or recording of the original lien, and a
statement that the original lien is to be continued for ten years. Thereafter,
such lien shall be enforced and notices of continuation filed in accordance
with the act.
(c) On and after May 1, 1999, if any employer defaults in any payment of
combined tax or interest, the commissioner may file a lien against such
employer in accordance with the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
Enforcement Act. Such liens shall set forth the amount of combined tax and
interest in default and shall be continued and enforced as provided in the
Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and Enforcement Act.
(2) It shall be the duty of the State of Nebraska, or any department or
agency thereof, county boards, the contracting board of all cities, villages,

any public building, bridge, highway, or other public structure or improvement,

entered into by the State of Nebraska, a department or agency thereof, an
officer or officers, or a board referred to in such subsection unless the

such contract awarded on or after June 1, 1957, the State of Nebraska,
department or agency thereof, officer or officers, or board awarding the
contract must have received from the contractor a written clearance from the
commissioner certifying that all payments then due of combined tax or interest
which may have arisen under such contract have been made by the contractor or
his or her subcontractor to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.
(5) The final three percent of any such contract referred to in subsection
(4) of this section may be paid if the contractor has supplied a bond with a
satisfactory surety company guaranteeing full payment to the Unemployment

Insurance Trust Fund of all combined tax and interest due under the Employment
Security Law.

claimant as to his or her wages, and any benefit payments based on such
statement of earnings, in the absence of fraud or collusion, shall be final as
to the amount.
(7) It is the intent of the Legislature that the amount of benefits to
which an eligible individual is entitled shall not be affected by any changes

Sec. 12. Section 48-648, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
48-648 (1) With respect to wages for employment, combined tax shall accrue
and become payable by each employer not otherwise entitled to make payments in
lieu of contributions for each calendar year in which he or she is subject to
the Employment Security Law. Such combined tax shall become due and be paid by
each employer to the commissioner for the Workforce Development Program Cash
State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund and the Unemployment Trust Fund in such
manner and at such times as the commissioner may, by rule and regulation,
prescribe. Such combined tax shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from
the wages of individuals in such employer's employ.
(2) The commissioner may require any employer whose annual payroll for
either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or exceeded one hundred
thousand dollars to file combined tax returns and pay combined taxes owed by an
electronic method approved by the commissioner, except when the employer
establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that filing the combined
tax return or payment of the tax by an electronic method would create a
hardship for the employer.
(3) In the payment of any combined tax, a fractional part of a cent shall
be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it
shall be increased to one cent. If the combined tax due for any reporting
period is less than five dollars, the employer need not remit the combined tax.
(4) If two or more related corporations or limited liability companies
concurrently employ the same individual and compensate such individual through
a common paymaster which is one of such corporations or limited liability
companies, each such corporation or limited liability company shall be
considered to have paid as remuneration to such individual only the amounts
actually disbursed by it to such individual and shall not be considered to have
paid as remuneration to such individual amounts actually disbursed to such
individual by another of such corporations or limited liability companies. An
employee of a wholly owned subsidiary shall be considered to be concurrently
employed by the parent corporation, company, or other entity and the wholly
owned subsidiary whether or not both companies separately provide remuneration.
(5) The professional employer organization shall report and pay combined
tax, penalties, and interest owed for wages earned by worksite employees under
the client's employer account number using the client's combined tax rate. The
client is liable for the payment of unpaid combined tax, penalties, and
interest owed for wages paid to worksite employees, and the worksite employees
shall be considered employees of the client for purposes of the Employment
Security Law.
(6) The Commissioner of Labor may require by rule and regulation that each
employer subject to the Employment Security Law shall submit to the
commissioner quarterly wage reports on such forms and in such manner as the
commissioner may prescribe. The commissioner may require any employer whose
annual payroll for either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or
exceeded one hundred thousand dollars to file wage reports by an electronic
method approved by the commissioner, except when the employer establishes to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that filing by an electronic method would
create a hardship for the employer. The quarterly wage reports shall be used by
the commissioner to make monetary determinations of claims for benefits.
Sec. 13. Section 48-649.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
48-649.01 (1) By December 1 of each calendar year, the commissioner shall
determine the state unemployment insurance tax rate for the following year
based on information available through the department. The state unemployment
insurance tax rate shall be zero percent if:
(a) The average balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund at
the end of any three months in the preceding calendar year is greater than one
percent of state taxable wages for the same preceding year; or
(b) The balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund equals or
exceeds thirty percent of the average month end balance of the state's account
in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the three lowest calendar months in the
preceding year.
(2) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is determined to be zero
percent pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the contribution rate for
all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined tax rate.
(3) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is not zero percent as
determined in this section, the combined tax rate shall be divided so that not
less than eighty percent of the combined tax rate equals the contribution rate
and not more than twenty percent of the combined tax rate equals the state
unemployment insurance tax rate except for employers who are assigned a
combined tax rate of five and four-tenths percent or more. For those employers,
the state unemployment insurance tax rate shall equal zero and their combined
tax rate shall equal their contribution rate.
Sec. 14. Section 48-649.03, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
48-649.03 (1) Once benefits have been payable from and chargeable to an
-7-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
employer's experience account throughout the preceding four calendar quarters
and wages for employment have been paid by the employer in each of the two
preceding four-calendar-quarter periods, the employer's combined tax rate shall
be calculated according to this section. The combined tax rate shall be based
upon the employer's experience rating record and determined from the employer's
reserve ratio.
(2) The employer's reserve ratio is the percent obtained by dividing (a)
the amount by which the employer's contributions credited from the time the
employer first or most recently became an employer, whichever date is later,
and up to and including September 30 of the year the rate computation is made,
plus any part of the employer's contributions due for that year paid on or
before October 31 of such year, exceed the employer's benefits charged during
the same period, by (b) the employer's average annual taxable payroll for the
sixteen-consecutive-calendar-quarter period ending September 30 of the year in
which the rate computation is made. For an employer with less than sixteen
consecutive calendar quarters of contribution experience, the employer's
average taxable payroll shall be determined based upon the four-calendar-
quarter periods for which contributions were payable.
(3) Each eligible experience rated employer shall be assigned to one of
twenty rate categories with a corresponding experience factor as follows:
Category Experience Factor
1 0.00
2 0.25
3 0.40
4 0.45
5 0.50
6 0.60
7 0.65
8 0.70
9 0.80
10 0.90
11 0.95
12 1.00
13 1.05
14 1.10
15 1.20
16 1.35
17 1.55
18 1.80
19 2.15
20 2.60
Eligible experience rated employers shall be assigned to rate categories
from highest to lowest according to their experience reserve ratio, with
category one assigned to accounts with the highest reserve ratios and category
twenty assigned to accounts with the lowest reserve ratios. Each category shall
be limited to no more than five percent of the state's total taxable payroll,
except that:
(a) Any employer with a portion of its taxable wages falling into two
consecutive categories shall be assigned to the lower category;
(b) No employer with a reserve ratio calculated to five decimal places
equal to the similarly calculated reserve ratio of another employer shall be
assigned to a higher rate than the employer to which it has the equal reserve
ratio; and
(c) No employer with a positive experience account balance shall be
assigned to category twenty.
(4) The state's reserve ratio shall be calculated annually by dividing the
amount available to pay benefits in the Unemployment Trust Fund and the State
Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund as of September 30, plus any amount of
combined tax owed by employers eligible for and electing annual payment status
for the four most recent quarters ending on September 30 in accordance with
-8-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner, by the state's total wages
from the four calendar quarters ending on September 30. For purposes of this
section, total wages means all remuneration paid by an employer in employment.
The state's reserve ratio shall be applied to the table in this subsection to
determine the yield factor for the upcoming rate year.
State's Reserve Ratio Yield Factor
1.75 percent and above = 0.50
1.60 percent up to but not including 1.75 = 0.60
1.45 percent up to but not including 1.60 = 0.70
1.30 percent up to but not including 1.45 = 0.75
1.15 percent up to but not including 1.30 = 0.80
1.00 percent up to but not including 1.15 = 0.90
0.85 percent up to but not including 1.00 = 1.00
0.70 percent up to but not including 0.85 = 1.10
0.60 percent up to but not including 0.70 = 1.20
0.50 percent up to but not including 0.60 = 1.25
0.45 percent up to but not including 0.50 = 1.30
0.40 percent up to but not including 0.45 = 1.35
0.35 percent up to but not including 0.40 = 1.40
0.30 percent up to but not including 0.35 = 1.45
Below 0.30 percent = 1.50
The commissioner may adjust the yield factor determined pursuant to the
preceding table to a lower scheduled yield factor if the state's reserve ratio
is 1.00 percent or greater. Once the yield factor for the upcoming rate year
has been determined, it is multiplied by the amount of unemployment benefits
paid from combined tax during the four calendar quarters ending September 30 of
the preceding year. The resulting figure is the planned yield for the rate
year. The planned yield is divided by the total taxable wages for the four
calendar quarters ending September 30 of the previous year and carried to four
decimal places to create the average combined tax rate for the rate year.
Beginning January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2029, the final average
combined tax rate shall be reduced by five percent.
(5) The average combined tax rate is assigned to rate category twelve as
established in subsection (3) of this section. Rates for each of the remaining
nineteen categories are determined by multiplying the average combined tax rate
by the experience factor associated with each category and carried to four
decimal places. Employers who are delinquent in filing their combined tax
reports as of October 31 of any year shall be assigned to category twenty for
the following calendar year unless the delinquency is corrected prior to
December 31 of the year of rate calculation.
(6) In addition to required contributions, an employer may make voluntary
contributions to the fund to be credited to his or her account. Voluntary
contributions by employers may be made up to the amount necessary to qualify
for one rate category reduction. Voluntary contributions received after
February 28 shall not be used in rate calculations for the same calendar year.
(7) As used in sections 48-648 to 48-654, the term payroll means the total
amount of wages during a calendar year, except as otherwise provided in section
48-654, by which the combined tax was measured.
Sec. 15. Section 48-657, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
48-657 (1)(a) If any employer defaults in any payment of combined tax or
interest, the commissioner may make in any manner feasible and cause to be
filed as a secured transaction as provided in article 9, Uniform Commercial
Code, and in the real estate mortgage records of any county in which such
employer is engaged in business or owns real or personal property, a statement,
under oath, showing the amount of combined tax and interest in default, which
statement, when filed for record, shall operate as a lien and mortgage on all
of the real and personal property of the employer, subject only to the liens of
prior record, and the property of such employer shall be subject to seizure and
sale for the payment of such combined taxes and interest. Such lien on personal
property may be enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by article 9,
Uniform Commercial Code, and such liens on real estate may be enforced or
dissolved in the manner provided by Chapter 25, article 21, in the enforcing
and dissolving of real estate mortgages. This subdivision shall only apply to
liens filed prior to May 1, 1999.
-9-

2025 2025
(b) A lien for unpaid combined taxes filed or recorded pursuant to
subdivision (a) of this subsection shall lapse at the earlier of its expiration
date or the fifth anniversary of the filing or recording date, unless the
commissioner files a notice of continuation in the place of the original filing
or recording and with the appropriate filing officer in the manner provided for
in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and Enforcement Act before such lien
lapses. A notice of continuation shall include all of the information required
by the act, the date of the filing or recording of the original lien, and a
statement that the original lien is to be continued for ten years. Thereafter,
such lien shall be enforced and notices of continuation filed in accordance
with the act.
(c) On and after May 1, 1999, if any employer defaults in any payment of
combined tax or interest, the commissioner may file a lien against such
employer in accordance with the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
Enforcement Act. Such liens shall set forth the amount of combined tax and
interest in default and shall be continued and enforced as provided in the
Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and Enforcement Act.
(2) It shall be the duty of the State of Nebraska, or any department or
agency thereof, county boards, the contracting board of all cities, villages,
and school districts, all public boards empowered by law to enter into a
contract by public bidding for the erecting and finishing or the repairing of
any public building, bridge, highway, or other public structure or improvement,
and any officer or officers so empowered by law to enter into such contract to
provide in such contract that the person, persons, firm, or corporation to whom
the contract is awarded will pay to the Unemployment Compensation Fund of the
State of Nebraska and the Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment
Insurance Trust Fund unemployment combined tax and interest due under the
Employment Security Law on wages paid to individuals employed in the
performance of such contract.
(3) No contract referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall be
entered into by the State of Nebraska, a department or agency thereof, an
officer or officers, or a board referred to in such subsection unless the
contract contains the proviso mentioned in such subsection.
(4) Before final payment may be made on the final three percent of any
such contract awarded on or after June 1, 1957, the State of Nebraska,
department or agency thereof, officer or officers, or board awarding the
contract must have received from the contractor a written clearance from the
commissioner certifying that all payments then due of combined tax or interest
which may have arisen under such contract have been made by the contractor or
his or her subcontractor to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.
(5) The final three percent of any such contract referred to in subsection
(4) of this section may be paid if the contractor has supplied a bond with a
satisfactory surety company guaranteeing full payment to the Unemployment
Compensation Fund and the Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment
Insurance Trust Fund of all combined tax and interest due under the Employment
Security Law.
Sec. 16. Section 48-3405, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
