25 in subsection (3) of this section:
26 (a) If the claimant has been separated from his or her employment
27 under circumstances under which he or she was or could have been

12 sections 48-624 and 48-625, each employer shall make reports, in
13 conformity with reasonable rules and regulations adopted and promulgated
14 by the commissioner, of the wages of any claimant. If any employer fails

17 benefit payments based on such statement of earnings, in the absence of
18 fraud or collusion, shall be final as to the amount.
19 (7) It is the intent of the Legislature that the amount of benefits
20 to which an eligible individual is entitled shall not be affected by any
21 changes made in this legislative bill.
22 Sec. 12. Section 48-648, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 48-648 (1) With respect to wages for employment, combined tax shall
25 accrue and become payable by each employer not otherwise entitled to make
26 payments in lieu of contributions for each calendar year in which he or
27 she is subject to the Employment Security Law. Such combined tax shall
28 become due and be paid by each employer to the commissioner for the
29 Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment Insurance Trust
30 Fund and the Unemployment Trust Fund in such manner and at such times as
31 the commissioner may, by rule and regulation, prescribe. Such combined
-18-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 tax shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the wages of
2 individuals in such employer's employ.
3 (2) The commissioner may require any employer whose annual payroll
4 for either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or exceeded
5 one hundred thousand dollars to file combined tax returns and pay
6 combined taxes owed by an electronic method approved by the commissioner,
7 except when the employer establishes to the satisfaction of the
8 commissioner that filing the combined tax return or payment of the tax by
9 an electronic method would create a hardship for the employer.
10 (3) In the payment of any combined tax, a fractional part of a cent
11 shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which
12 case it shall be increased to one cent. If the combined tax due for any
13 reporting period is less than five dollars, the employer need not remit
14 the combined tax.
15 (4) If two or more related corporations or limited liability
16 companies concurrently employ the same individual and compensate such
17 individual through a common paymaster which is one of such corporations
18 or limited liability companies, each such corporation or limited
19 liability company shall be considered to have paid as remuneration to
20 such individual only the amounts actually disbursed by it to such
21 individual and shall not be considered to have paid as remuneration to
22 such individual amounts actually disbursed to such individual by another
23 of such corporations or limited liability companies. An employee of a
24 wholly owned subsidiary shall be considered to be concurrently employed
25 by the parent corporation, company, or other entity and the wholly owned
26 subsidiary whether or not both companies separately provide remuneration.
27 (5) The professional employer organization shall report and pay
28 combined tax, penalties, and interest owed for wages earned by worksite
29 employees under the client's employer account number using the client's
30 combined tax rate. The client is liable for the payment of unpaid
31 combined tax, penalties, and interest owed for wages paid to worksite

1 employees, and the worksite employees shall be considered employees of
2 the client for purposes of the Employment Security Law.
3 (6) The Commissioner of Labor may require by rule and regulation
4 that each employer subject to the Employment Security Law shall submit to
5 the commissioner quarterly wage reports on such forms and in such manner
6 as the commissioner may prescribe. The commissioner may require any
7 employer whose annual payroll for either of the two preceding calendar
8 years has equaled or exceeded one hundred thousand dollars to file wage
9 reports by an electronic method approved by the commissioner, except when
10 the employer establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that
11 filing by an electronic method would create a hardship for the employer.
12 The quarterly wage reports shall be used by the commissioner to make
13 monetary determinations of claims for benefits.
14 Sec. 13. Section 48-649.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 48-649.01 (1) By December 1 of each calendar year, the commissioner
17 shall determine the state unemployment insurance tax rate for the
18 following year based on information available through the department. The
19 state unemployment insurance tax rate shall be zero percent if:
20 (a) The average balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust
21 Fund at the end of any three months in the preceding calendar year is
22 greater than one percent of state taxable wages for the same preceding
23 year; or
24 (b) The balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund
25 equals or exceeds thirty percent of the average month end balance of the
26 state's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the three lowest
27 calendar months in the preceding year.
28 (2) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is determined to be
29 zero percent pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the contribution
30 rate for all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined
31 tax rate.
-20-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 (3) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is not zero percent
2 as determined in this section, the combined tax rate shall be divided so
3 that not less than eighty percent of the combined tax rate equals the
4 contribution rate and not more than twenty percent of the combined tax
5 rate equals the state unemployment insurance tax rate except for
6 employers who are assigned a combined tax rate of five and four-tenths
7 percent or more. For those employers, the state unemployment insurance
8 tax rate shall equal zero and their combined tax rate shall equal their
9 contribution rate.
10 Sec. 14. Section 48-649.03, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
11 2024, is amended to read:
12 48-649.03 (1) Once benefits have been payable from and chargeable to
13 an employer's experience account throughout the preceding four calendar
14 quarters and wages for employment have been paid by the employer in each
15 of the two preceding four-calendar-quarter periods, the employer's
16 combined tax rate shall be calculated according to this section. The
17 combined tax rate shall be based upon the employer's experience rating
18 record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.
19 (2) The employer's reserve ratio is the percent obtained by dividing
20 (a) the amount by which the employer's contributions credited from the
21 time the employer first or most recently became an employer, whichever
22 date is later, and up to and including September 30 of the year the rate
23 computation is made, plus any part of the employer's contributions due
24 for that year paid on or before October 31 of such year, exceed the
25 employer's benefits charged during the same period, by (b) the employer's
26 average annual taxable payroll for the sixteen-consecutive-calendar-
27 quarter period ending September 30 of the year in which the rate
28 computation is made. For an employer with less than sixteen consecutive
29 calendar quarters of contribution experience, the employer's average
30 taxable payroll shall be determined based upon the four-calendar-quarter
31 periods for which contributions were payable.
-21-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 (3) Each eligible experience rated employer shall be assigned to one
2 of twenty rate categories with a corresponding experience factor as
3 follows:
4 Category Experience Factor
5 1 0.00
6 2 0.25
7 3 0.40
8 4 0.45
9 5 0.50
10 6 0.60
11 7 0.65
12 8 0.70
13 9 0.80
14 10 0.90
15 11 0.95
16 12 1.00
17 13 1.05
18 14 1.10
19 15 1.20
20 16 1.35
21 17 1.55
22 18 1.80
23 19 2.15
24 20 2.60
25 Eligible experience rated employers shall be assigned to rate
26 categories from highest to lowest according to their experience reserve
27 ratio, with category one assigned to accounts with the highest reserve
28 ratios and category twenty assigned to accounts with the lowest reserve
29 ratios. Each category shall be limited to no more than five percent of
30 the state's total taxable payroll, except that:
-22-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 (a) Any employer with a portion of its taxable wages falling into
2 two consecutive categories shall be assigned to the lower category;
3 (b) No employer with a reserve ratio calculated to five decimal
4 places equal to the similarly calculated reserve ratio of another
5 employer shall be assigned to a higher rate than the employer to which it
6 has the equal reserve ratio; and
7 (c) No employer with a positive experience account balance shall be
8 assigned to category twenty.
9 (4) The state's reserve ratio shall be calculated annually by
10 dividing the amount available to pay benefits in the Unemployment Trust
11 Fund and the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund as of September 30,
12 plus any amount of combined tax owed by employers eligible for and
13 electing annual payment status for the four most recent quarters ending
14 on September 30 in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the
15 commissioner, by the state's total wages from the four calendar quarters
16 ending on September 30. For purposes of this section, total wages means
17 all remuneration paid by an employer in employment. The state's reserve
18 ratio shall be applied to the table in this subsection to determine the
19 yield factor for the upcoming rate year.
20 State's Reserve Ratio Yield Factor
21 1.75 percent and above = 0.50
22 1.60 percent up to but not including 1.75 = 0.60
23 1.45 percent up to but not including 1.60 = 0.70
24 1.30 percent up to but not including 1.45 = 0.75
25 1.15 percent up to but not including 1.30 = 0.80
26 1.00 percent up to but not including 1.15 = 0.90
27 0.85 percent up to but not including 1.00 = 1.00
28 0.70 percent up to but not including 0.85 = 1.10
29 0.60 percent up to but not including 0.70 = 1.20
30 0.50 percent up to but not including 0.60 = 1.25
31 0.45 percent up to but not including 0.50 = 1.30
-23-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 0.40 percent up to but not including 0.45 = 1.35
2 0.35 percent up to but not including 0.40 = 1.40
3 0.30 percent up to but not including 0.35 = 1.45
4 Below 0.30 percent = 1.50
5 The commissioner may adjust the yield factor determined pursuant to
6 the preceding table to a lower scheduled yield factor if the state's
7 reserve ratio is 1.00 percent or greater. Once the yield factor for the
8 upcoming rate year has been determined, it is multiplied by the amount of
9 unemployment benefits paid from combined tax during the four calendar
10 quarters ending September 30 of the preceding year. The resulting figure
11 is the planned yield for the rate year. The planned yield is divided by
12 the total taxable wages for the four calendar quarters ending September
13 30 of the previous year and carried to four decimal places to create the
14 average combined tax rate for the rate year. Beginning January 1, 2025,
15 through December 31, 2029, the final average combined tax rate shall be
16 reduced by five percent.
17 (5) The average combined tax rate is assigned to rate category
18 twelve as established in subsection (3) of this section. Rates for each
19 of the remaining nineteen categories are determined by multiplying the
20 average combined tax rate by the experience factor associated with each
21 category and carried to four decimal places. Employers who are delinquent
22 in filing their combined tax reports as of October 31 of any year shall
23 be assigned to category twenty for the following calendar year unless the
24 delinquency is corrected prior to December 31 of the year of rate
25 calculation.
26 (6) In addition to required contributions, an employer may make
27 voluntary contributions to the fund to be credited to his or her account.
28 Voluntary contributions by employers may be made up to the amount
29 necessary to qualify for one rate category reduction. Voluntary
30 contributions received after February 28 shall not be used in rate
31 calculations for the same calendar year.

10 county in which such employer is engaged in business or owns real or
11 personal property, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of
12 combined tax and interest in default, which statement, when filed for
13 record, shall operate as a lien and mortgage on all of the real and
14 personal property of the employer, subject only to the liens of prior
15 record, and the property of such employer shall be subject to seizure and
16 sale for the payment of such combined taxes and interest. Such lien on
17 personal property may be enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by
18 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, and such liens on real estate may be
19 enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by Chapter 25, article 21,
20 in the enforcing and dissolving of real estate mortgages. This
21 subdivision shall only apply to liens filed prior to May 1, 1999.
22 (b) A lien for unpaid combined taxes filed or recorded pursuant to
23 subdivision (a) of this subsection shall lapse at the earlier of its
24 expiration date or the fifth anniversary of the filing or recording date,
25 unless the commissioner files a notice of continuation in the place of
26 the original filing or recording and with the appropriate filing officer
27 in the manner provided for in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
28 Enforcement Act before such lien lapses. A notice of continuation shall
29 include all of the information required by the act, the date of the
30 filing or recording of the original lien, and a statement that the
31 original lien is to be continued for ten years. Thereafter, such lien

19 Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment Insurance Trust
20 Fund unemployment combined tax and interest due under the Employment

22 such contract.
23 (3) No contract referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall
24 be entered into by the State of Nebraska, a department or agency thereof,
25 an officer or officers, or a board referred to in such subsection unless
26 the contract contains the proviso mentioned in such subsection.
27 (4) Before final payment may be made on the final three percent of

29 Nebraska, department or agency thereof, officer or officers, or board
30 awarding the contract must have received from the contractor a written
