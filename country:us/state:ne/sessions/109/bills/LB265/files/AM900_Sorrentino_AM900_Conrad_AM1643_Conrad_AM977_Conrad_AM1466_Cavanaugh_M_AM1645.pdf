1 she is subject to the Employment Security Law. Such combined tax shall
2 become due and be paid by each employer to the commissioner for the
3 Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment Insurance Trust
4 Fund and the Unemployment Trust Fund in such manner and at such times as
5 the commissioner may, by rule and regulation, prescribe. Such combined
6 tax shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the wages of
7 individuals in such employer's employ.
8 (2) The commissioner may require any employer whose annual payroll
9 for either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or exceeded
10 one hundred thousand dollars to file combined tax returns and pay
11 combined taxes owed by an electronic method approved by the commissioner,
12 except when the employer establishes to the satisfaction of the
13 commissioner that filing the combined tax return or payment of the tax by
14 an electronic method would create a hardship for the employer.
15 (3) In the payment of any combined tax, a fractional part of a cent
16 shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which
17 case it shall be increased to one cent. If the combined tax due for any
18 reporting period is less than five dollars, the employer need not remit
19 the combined tax.

25 such individual only the amounts actually disbursed by it to such
26 individual and shall not be considered to have paid as remuneration to
27 such individual amounts actually disbursed to such individual by another
28 of such corporations or limited liability companies. An employee of a
29 wholly owned subsidiary shall be considered to be concurrently employed
30 by the parent corporation, company, or other entity and the wholly owned
31 subsidiary whether or not both companies separately provide remuneration.

21 48-649.01 (1) By December 1 of each calendar year, the commissioner
22 shall determine the state unemployment insurance tax rate for the
23 following year based on information available through the department. The
24 state unemployment insurance tax rate shall be zero percent if:
25 (a) The average balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust
26 Fund at the end of any three months in the preceding calendar year is
27 greater than one percent of state taxable wages for the same preceding
28 year; or
29 (b) The balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund
30 equals or exceeds thirty percent of the average month end balance of the
31 state's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the three lowest

1 calendar months in the preceding year.
2 (2) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is determined to be
3 zero percent pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the contribution
4 rate for all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined
5 tax rate.
6 (3) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is not zero percent
7 as determined in this section, the combined tax rate shall be divided so
8 that not less than eighty percent of the combined tax rate equals the
9 contribution rate and not more than twenty percent of the combined tax
10 rate equals the state unemployment insurance tax rate except for
11 employers who are assigned a combined tax rate of five and four-tenths
12 percent or more. For those employers, the state unemployment insurance
13 tax rate shall equal zero and their combined tax rate shall equal their
14 contribution rate.
15 Sec. 14. Section 48-649.03, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
16 2024, is amended to read:
17 48-649.03 (1) Once benefits have been payable from and chargeable to
18 an employer's experience account throughout the preceding four calendar
19 quarters and wages for employment have been paid by the employer in each
20 of the two preceding four-calendar-quarter periods, the employer's
21 combined tax rate shall be calculated according to this section. The
22 combined tax rate shall be based upon the employer's experience rating
23 record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.
24 (2) The employer's reserve ratio is the percent obtained by dividing
25 (a) the amount by which the employer's contributions credited from the
26 time the employer first or most recently became an employer, whichever
27 date is later, and up to and including September 30 of the year the rate
28 computation is made, plus any part of the employer's contributions due
29 for that year paid on or before October 31 of such year, exceed the
30 employer's benefits charged during the same period, by (b) the employer's
31 average annual taxable payroll for the sixteen-consecutive-calendar-

AM900 AM900
LB265 LB265
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 quarter period ending September 30 of the year in which the rate
2 computation is made. For an employer with less than sixteen consecutive
3 calendar quarters of contribution experience, the employer's average
4 taxable payroll shall be determined based upon the four-calendar-quarter
5 periods for which contributions were payable.
6 (3) Each eligible experience rated employer shall be assigned to one
7 of twenty rate categories with a corresponding experience factor as
8 follows:
9 Category Experience Factor
10 1 0.00
11 2 0.25
12 3 0.40
13 4 0.45

25 16 1.35
26 17 1.55
27 18 1.80
28 19 2.15
29 20 2.60
30 Eligible experience rated employers shall be assigned to rate
-21-

AM900 AM900
LB265 LB265
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 categories from highest to lowest according to their experience reserve
2 ratio, with category one assigned to accounts with the highest reserve
3 ratios and category twenty assigned to accounts with the lowest reserve
4 ratios. Each category shall be limited to no more than five percent of
5 the state's total taxable payroll, except that:
6 (a) Any employer with a portion of its taxable wages falling into
7 two consecutive categories shall be assigned to the lower category;
8 (b) No employer with a reserve ratio calculated to five decimal
9 places equal to the similarly calculated reserve ratio of another
10 employer shall be assigned to a higher rate than the employer to which it
11 has the equal reserve ratio; and
12 (c) No employer with a positive experience account balance shall be
13 assigned to category twenty.
14 (4) The state's reserve ratio shall be calculated annually by
15 dividing the amount available to pay benefits in the Unemployment Trust
16 Fund and the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund as of September 30,
17 plus any amount of combined tax owed by employers eligible for and
18 electing annual payment status for the four most recent quarters ending
19 on September 30 in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the
20 commissioner, by the state's total wages from the four calendar quarters
21 ending on September 30. For purposes of this section, total wages means
22 all remuneration paid by an employer in employment. The state's reserve
23 ratio shall be applied to the table in this subsection to determine the
24 yield factor for the upcoming rate year.
25 State's Reserve Ratio Yield Factor
26 1.75 percent and above = 0.50
27 1.60 percent up to but not including 1.75 = 0.60
28 1.45 percent up to but not including 1.60 = 0.70
29 1.30 percent up to but not including 1.45 = 0.75
30 1.15 percent up to but not including 1.30 = 0.80
-22-

LB265 LB265
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 1.00 percent up to but not including 1.15 = 0.90
2 0.85 percent up to but not including 1.00 = 1.00
3 0.70 percent up to but not including 0.85 = 1.10
4 0.60 percent up to but not including 0.70 = 1.20
5 0.50 percent up to but not including 0.60 = 1.25
6 0.45 percent up to but not including 0.50 = 1.30
7 0.40 percent up to but not including 0.45 = 1.35
8 0.35 percent up to but not including 0.40 = 1.40
9 0.30 percent up to but not including 0.35 = 1.45
10 Below 0.30 percent = 1.50
11 The commissioner may adjust the yield factor determined pursuant to
12 the preceding table to a lower scheduled yield factor if the state's
13 reserve ratio is 1.00 percent or greater. Once the yield factor for the
14 upcoming rate year has been determined, it is multiplied by the amount of
15 unemployment benefits paid from combined tax during the four calendar
16 quarters ending September 30 of the preceding year. The resulting figure
17 is the planned yield for the rate year. The planned yield is divided by
18 the total taxable wages for the four calendar quarters ending September
19 30 of the previous year and carried to four decimal places to create the
20 average combined tax rate for the rate year. Beginning January 1, 2025,
21 through December 31, 2029, the final average combined tax rate shall be
22 reduced by five percent.
23 (5) The average combined tax rate is assigned to rate category
24 twelve as established in subsection (3) of this section. Rates for each
25 of the remaining nineteen categories are determined by multiplying the
26 average combined tax rate by the experience factor associated with each
27 category and carried to four decimal places. Employers who are delinquent
28 in filing their combined tax reports as of October 31 of any year shall
29 be assigned to category twenty for the following calendar year unless the
30 delinquency is corrected prior to December 31 of the year of rate

2 (6) In addition to required contributions, an employer may make
3 voluntary contributions to the fund to be credited to his or her account.
4 Voluntary contributions by employers may be made up to the amount
5 necessary to qualify for one rate category reduction. Voluntary
6 contributions received after February 28 shall not be used in rate
7 calculations for the same calendar year.
8 (7) As used in sections 48-648 to 48-654, the term payroll means the
9 total amount of wages during a calendar year, except as otherwise
10 provided in section 48-654, by which the combined tax was measured.

17 county in which such employer is engaged in business or owns real or
18 personal property, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of

21 personal property of the employer, subject only to the liens of prior
22 record, and the property of such employer shall be subject to seizure and
23 sale for the payment of such combined taxes and interest. Such lien on
24 personal property may be enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by
25 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, and such liens on real estate may be
26 enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by Chapter 25, article 21,
27 in the enforcing and dissolving of real estate mortgages. This
28 subdivision shall only apply to liens filed prior to May 1, 1999.
29 (b) A lien for unpaid combined taxes filed or recorded pursuant to
30 subdivision (a) of this subsection shall lapse at the earlier of its
