22 (2) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is determined to be
23 zero percent pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the contribution
24 rate for all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined
25 tax rate.
26 (3) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is not zero percent
27 as determined in this section, the combined tax rate shall be divided so
28 that not less than eighty percent of the combined tax rate equals the
29 contribution rate and not more than twenty percent of the combined tax
30 rate equals the state unemployment insurance tax rate except for
31 employers who are assigned a combined tax rate of five and four-tenths
-15-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 percent or more. For those employers, the state unemployment insurance
2 tax rate shall equal zero and their combined tax rate shall equal their
3 contribution rate.
4 Sec. 6. Section 48-649.03, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
5 2024, is amended to read:
6 48-649.03 (1) Once benefits have been payable from and chargeable to
7 an employer's experience account throughout the preceding four calendar
8 quarters and wages for employment have been paid by the employer in each
9 of the two preceding four-calendar-quarter periods, the employer's
10 combined tax rate shall be calculated according to this section. The
11 combined tax rate shall be based upon the employer's experience rating
12 record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.
13 (2) The employer's reserve ratio is the percent obtained by dividing
14 (a) the amount by which the employer's contributions credited from the
15 time the employer first or most recently became an employer, whichever
16 date is later, and up to and including September 30 of the year the rate
17 computation is made, plus any part of the employer's contributions due
18 for that year paid on or before October 31 of such year, exceed the
19 employer's benefits charged during the same period, by (b) the employer's
20 average annual taxable payroll for the sixteen-consecutive-calendar-
21 quarter period ending September 30 of the year in which the rate
22 computation is made. For an employer with less than sixteen consecutive
23 calendar quarters of contribution experience, the employer's average
24 taxable payroll shall be determined based upon the four-calendar-quarter
25 periods for which contributions were payable.
26 (3) Each eligible experience rated employer shall be assigned to one
27 of twenty rate categories with a corresponding experience factor as
28 follows:
29 Category Experience Factor
30 1 0.00
31 2 0.25
-16-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 3 0.40
2 4 0.45
3 5 0.50
4 6 0.60
5 7 0.65
6 8 0.70
7 9 0.80
8 10 0.90
9 11 0.95
10 12 1.00
11 13 1.05
12 14 1.10
13 15 1.20
14 16 1.35
15 17 1.55
16 18 1.80
17 19 2.15
18 20 2.60
19 Eligible experience rated employers shall be assigned to rate
20 categories from highest to lowest according to their experience reserve
21 ratio, with category one assigned to accounts with the highest reserve
22 ratios and category twenty assigned to accounts with the lowest reserve
23 ratios. Each category shall be limited to no more than five percent of
24 the state's total taxable payroll, except that:
25 (a) Any employer with a portion of its taxable wages falling into
26 two consecutive categories shall be assigned to the lower category;
27 (b) No employer with a reserve ratio calculated to five decimal
28 places equal to the similarly calculated reserve ratio of another
29 employer shall be assigned to a higher rate than the employer to which it
30 has the equal reserve ratio; and
-17-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 (c) No employer with a positive experience account balance shall be
2 assigned to category twenty.
3 (4) The state's reserve ratio shall be calculated annually by
4 dividing the amount available to pay benefits in the Unemployment Trust
5 Fund and the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund as of September 30,
6 plus any amount of combined tax owed by employers eligible for and
7 electing annual payment status for the four most recent quarters ending
8 on September 30 in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the
9 commissioner, by the state's total wages from the four calendar quarters
10 ending on September 30. For purposes of this section, total wages means
11 all remuneration paid by an employer in employment. The state's reserve
12 ratio shall be applied to the table in this subsection to determine the
13 yield factor for the upcoming rate year.
14 State's Reserve Ratio Yield Factor
15 1.75 percent and above = 0.50
16 1.60 percent up to but not including 1.75 = 0.60
17 1.45 percent up to but not including 1.60 = 0.70
18 1.30 percent up to but not including 1.45 = 0.75
19 1.15 percent up to but not including 1.30 = 0.80
20 1.00 percent up to but not including 1.15 = 0.90
21 0.85 percent up to but not including 1.00 = 1.00
22 0.70 percent up to but not including 0.85 = 1.10
23 0.60 percent up to but not including 0.70 = 1.20
24 0.50 percent up to but not including 0.60 = 1.25
25 0.45 percent up to but not including 0.50 = 1.30
26 0.40 percent up to but not including 0.45 = 1.35
27 0.35 percent up to but not including 0.40 = 1.40
28 0.30 percent up to but not including 0.35 = 1.45
29 Below 0.30 percent = 1.50
30 The commissioner may adjust the yield factor determined pursuant to
31 the preceding table to a lower scheduled yield factor if the state's
-18-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 reserve ratio is 1.00 percent or greater. Once the yield factor for the
2 upcoming rate year has been determined, it is multiplied by the amount of
3 unemployment benefits paid from combined tax during the four calendar
4 quarters ending September 30 of the preceding year. The resulting figure
5 is the planned yield for the rate year. The planned yield is divided by
6 the total taxable wages for the four calendar quarters ending September
7 30 of the previous year and carried to four decimal places to create the
8 average combined tax rate for the rate year. Beginning January 1, 2025,
9 through December 31, 2029, the final average combined tax rate shall be
10 reduced by five percent.
11 (5) The average combined tax rate is assigned to rate category
12 twelve as established in subsection (3) of this section. Rates for each
13 of the remaining nineteen categories are determined by multiplying the
14 average combined tax rate by the experience factor associated with each
15 category and carried to four decimal places. Employers who are delinquent
16 in filing their combined tax reports as of October 31 of any year shall
17 be assigned to category twenty for the following calendar year unless the
18 delinquency is corrected prior to December 31 of the year of rate
19 calculation.
20 (6) In addition to required contributions, an employer may make
21 voluntary contributions to the fund to be credited to his or her account.
22 Voluntary contributions by employers may be made up to the amount
23 necessary to qualify for one rate category reduction. Voluntary
24 contributions received after February 28 shall not be used in rate
25 calculations for the same calendar year.
26 (7) As used in sections 48-648 to 48-654, the term payroll means the
27 total amount of wages during a calendar year, except as otherwise
28 provided in section 48-654, by which the combined tax was measured.
29 Sec. 7. Section 48-657, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 48-657 (1)(a) If any employer defaults in any payment of combined
-19-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 tax or interest, the commissioner may make in any manner feasible and
2 cause to be filed as a secured transaction as provided in article 9,
3 Uniform Commercial Code, and in the real estate mortgage records of any
4 county in which such employer is engaged in business or owns real or
5 personal property, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of
6 combined tax and interest in default, which statement, when filed for
7 record, shall operate as a lien and mortgage on all of the real and
8 personal property of the employer, subject only to the liens of prior
9 record, and the property of such employer shall be subject to seizure and
10 sale for the payment of such combined taxes and interest. Such lien on
11 personal property may be enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by
12 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, and such liens on real estate may be
13 enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by Chapter 25, article 21,
14 in the enforcing and dissolving of real estate mortgages. This
15 subdivision shall only apply to liens filed prior to May 1, 1999.
16 (b) A lien for unpaid combined taxes filed or recorded pursuant to
17 subdivision (a) of this subsection shall lapse at the earlier of its
18 expiration date or the fifth anniversary of the filing or recording date,
19 unless the commissioner files a notice of continuation in the place of
20 the original filing or recording and with the appropriate filing officer
21 in the manner provided for in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
22 Enforcement Act before such lien lapses. A notice of continuation shall
23 include all of the information required by the act, the date of the
24 filing or recording of the original lien, and a statement that the
25 original lien is to be continued for ten years. Thereafter, such lien
26 shall be enforced and notices of continuation filed in accordance with
27 the act.
28 (c) On and after May 1, 1999, if any employer defaults in any
29 payment of combined tax or interest, the commissioner may file a lien
30 against such employer in accordance with the Uniform State Tax Lien
31 Registration and Enforcement Act. Such liens shall set forth the amount
-20-
LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 of combined tax and interest in default and shall be continued and
2 enforced as provided in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
3 Enforcement Act.
4 (2) It shall be the duty of the State of Nebraska, or any department
5 or agency thereof, county boards, the contracting board of all cities,
6 villages, and school districts, all public boards empowered by law to
7 enter into a contract by public bidding for the erecting and finishing or
8 the repairing of any public building, bridge, highway, or other public
9 structure or improvement, and any officer or officers so empowered by law
10 to enter into such contract to provide in such contract that the person,
11 persons, firm, or corporation to whom the contract is awarded will pay to
12 the Unemployment Compensation Fund of the State of Nebraska and the
13 Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment Insurance Trust
14 Fund unemployment combined tax and interest due under the Employment
15 Security Law on wages paid to individuals employed in the performance of
16 such contract.
17 (3) No contract referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall
18 be entered into by the State of Nebraska, a department or agency thereof,
19 an officer or officers, or a board referred to in such subsection unless
20 the contract contains the proviso mentioned in such subsection.
21 (4) Before final payment may be made on the final three percent of
22 any such contract awarded on or after June 1, 1957, the State of
23 Nebraska, department or agency thereof, officer or officers, or board
24 awarding the contract must have received from the contractor a written
25 clearance from the commissioner certifying that all payments then due of
26 combined tax or interest which may have arisen under such contract have
27 been made by the contractor or his or her subcontractor to the
28 Unemployment Compensation Fund.
29 (5) The final three percent of any such contract referred to in
30 subsection (4) of this section may be paid if the contractor has supplied
31 a bond with a satisfactory surety company guaranteeing full payment to

16 Sec. 4. Section 48-648, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 48-648 (1) With respect to wages for employment, combined tax shall
19 accrue and become payable by each employer not otherwise entitled to make
20 payments in lieu of contributions for each calendar year in which he or
21 she is subject to the Employment Security Law. Such combined tax shall
22 become due and be paid by each employer to the commissioner for the
23 Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment Insurance Trust
24 Fund and the Unemployment Trust Fund in such manner and at such times as
25 the commissioner may, by rule and regulation, prescribe. Such combined
26 tax shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the wages of
27 individuals in such employer's employ.
28 (2) The commissioner may require any employer whose annual payroll
29 for either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or exceeded
30 one hundred thousand dollars to file combined tax returns and pay
31 combined taxes owed by an electronic method approved by the commissioner,
-13-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 except when the employer establishes to the satisfaction of the
2 commissioner that filing the combined tax return or payment of the tax by
3 an electronic method would create a hardship for the employer.
4 (3) In the payment of any combined tax, a fractional part of a cent
5 shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which
6 case it shall be increased to one cent. If the combined tax due for any
7 reporting period is less than five dollars, the employer need not remit
8 the combined tax.
9 (4) If two or more related corporations or limited liability
10 companies concurrently employ the same individual and compensate such
11 individual through a common paymaster which is one of such corporations
12 or limited liability companies, each such corporation or limited
13 liability company shall be considered to have paid as remuneration to
14 such individual only the amounts actually disbursed by it to such
15 individual and shall not be considered to have paid as remuneration to
16 such individual amounts actually disbursed to such individual by another
17 of such corporations or limited liability companies. An employee of a
18 wholly owned subsidiary shall be considered to be concurrently employed
19 by the parent corporation, company, or other entity and the wholly owned
20 subsidiary whether or not both companies separately provide remuneration.
21 (5) The professional employer organization shall report and pay
22 combined tax, penalties, and interest owed for wages earned by worksite
23 employees under the client's employer account number using the client's
24 combined tax rate. The client is liable for the payment of unpaid
25 combined tax, penalties, and interest owed for wages paid to worksite
26 employees, and the worksite employees shall be considered employees of
27 the client for purposes of the Employment Security Law.
28 (6) The Commissioner of Labor may require by rule and regulation
29 that each employer subject to the Employment Security Law shall submit to
30 the commissioner quarterly wage reports on such forms and in such manner
31 as the commissioner may prescribe. The commissioner may require any
-14-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 employer whose annual payroll for either of the two preceding calendar
2 years has equaled or exceeded one hundred thousand dollars to file wage
3 reports by an electronic method approved by the commissioner, except when
4 the employer establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that
5 filing by an electronic method would create a hardship for the employer.
6 The quarterly wage reports shall be used by the commissioner to make
7 monetary determinations of claims for benefits.
8 Sec. 5. Section 48-649.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
9 amended to read:
10 48-649.01 (1) By December 1 of each calendar year, the commissioner
11 shall determine the state unemployment insurance tax rate for the
12 following year based on information available through the department. The
13 state unemployment insurance tax rate shall be zero percent if:
14 (a) The average balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust
15 Fund at the end of any three months in the preceding calendar year is
16 greater than one percent of state taxable wages for the same preceding
17 year; or
18 (b) The balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund
19 equals or exceeds thirty percent of the average month end balance of the
20 state's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the three lowest
21 calendar months in the preceding year.
22 (2) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is determined to be
23 zero percent pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the contribution
24 rate for all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined
25 tax rate.
26 (3) If the state unemployment insurance tax rate is not zero percent
27 as determined in this section, the combined tax rate shall be divided so
28 that not less than eighty percent of the combined tax rate equals the
29 contribution rate and not more than twenty percent of the combined tax
30 rate equals the state unemployment insurance tax rate except for
31 employers who are assigned a combined tax rate of five and four-tenths
-15-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 percent or more. For those employers, the state unemployment insurance
2 tax rate shall equal zero and their combined tax rate shall equal their
3 contribution rate.
4 Sec. 6. Section 48-649.03, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
5 2024, is amended to read:
6 48-649.03 (1) Once benefits have been payable from and chargeable to
7 an employer's experience account throughout the preceding four calendar
8 quarters and wages for employment have been paid by the employer in each
9 of the two preceding four-calendar-quarter periods, the employer's
10 combined tax rate shall be calculated according to this section. The
11 combined tax rate shall be based upon the employer's experience rating
12 record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.
13 (2) The employer's reserve ratio is the percent obtained by dividing
14 (a) the amount by which the employer's contributions credited from the
15 time the employer first or most recently became an employer, whichever
16 date is later, and up to and including September 30 of the year the rate
17 computation is made, plus any part of the employer's contributions due
18 for that year paid on or before October 31 of such year, exceed the
19 employer's benefits charged during the same period, by (b) the employer's
20 average annual taxable payroll for the sixteen-consecutive-calendar-
21 quarter period ending September 30 of the year in which the rate
22 computation is made. For an employer with less than sixteen consecutive
23 calendar quarters of contribution experience, the employer's average
24 taxable payroll shall be determined based upon the four-calendar-quarter
25 periods for which contributions were payable.
26 (3) Each eligible experience rated employer shall be assigned to one
27 of twenty rate categories with a corresponding experience factor as
28 follows:
29 Category Experience Factor
30 1 0.00
31 2 0.25
-16-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 3 0.40
2 4 0.45
3 5 0.50
4 6 0.60
5 7 0.65
6 8 0.70
7 9 0.80
8 10 0.90
9 11 0.95
10 12 1.00
11 13 1.05
12 14 1.10
13 15 1.20
14 16 1.35
15 17 1.55
16 18 1.80
17 19 2.15
18 20 2.60
19 Eligible experience rated employers shall be assigned to rate
20 categories from highest to lowest according to their experience reserve
21 ratio, with category one assigned to accounts with the highest reserve
22 ratios and category twenty assigned to accounts with the lowest reserve
23 ratios. Each category shall be limited to no more than five percent of
24 the state's total taxable payroll, except that:
25 (a) Any employer with a portion of its taxable wages falling into
26 two consecutive categories shall be assigned to the lower category;
27 (b) No employer with a reserve ratio calculated to five decimal
28 places equal to the similarly calculated reserve ratio of another
29 employer shall be assigned to a higher rate than the employer to which it
30 has the equal reserve ratio; and
-17-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 (c) No employer with a positive experience account balance shall be
2 assigned to category twenty.
3 (4) The state's reserve ratio shall be calculated annually by
4 dividing the amount available to pay benefits in the Unemployment Trust
5 Fund and the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund as of September 30,
6 plus any amount of combined tax owed by employers eligible for and
7 electing annual payment status for the four most recent quarters ending
8 on September 30 in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the
9 commissioner, by the state's total wages from the four calendar quarters
10 ending on September 30. For purposes of this section, total wages means
11 all remuneration paid by an employer in employment. The state's reserve
12 ratio shall be applied to the table in this subsection to determine the
13 yield factor for the upcoming rate year.
14 State's Reserve Ratio Yield Factor
15 1.75 percent and above = 0.50
16 1.60 percent up to but not including 1.75 = 0.60
17 1.45 percent up to but not including 1.60 = 0.70
18 1.30 percent up to but not including 1.45 = 0.75
19 1.15 percent up to but not including 1.30 = 0.80
20 1.00 percent up to but not including 1.15 = 0.90
21 0.85 percent up to but not including 1.00 = 1.00
22 0.70 percent up to but not including 0.85 = 1.10
23 0.60 percent up to but not including 0.70 = 1.20
24 0.50 percent up to but not including 0.60 = 1.25
25 0.45 percent up to but not including 0.50 = 1.30
26 0.40 percent up to but not including 0.45 = 1.35
27 0.35 percent up to but not including 0.40 = 1.40
28 0.30 percent up to but not including 0.35 = 1.45
29 Below 0.30 percent = 1.50
30 The commissioner may adjust the yield factor determined pursuant to
31 the preceding table to a lower scheduled yield factor if the state's
-18-

LB265 LB265
2025 2025
1 reserve ratio is 1.00 percent or greater. Once the yield factor for the
2 upcoming rate year has been determined, it is multiplied by the amount of
3 unemployment benefits paid from combined tax during the four calendar
4 quarters ending September 30 of the preceding year. The resulting figure
5 is the planned yield for the rate year. The planned yield is divided by
6 the total taxable wages for the four calendar quarters ending September
7 30 of the previous year and carried to four decimal places to create the
8 average combined tax rate for the rate year. Beginning January 1, 2025,
9 through December 31, 2029, the final average combined tax rate shall be
10 reduced by five percent.
11 (5) The average combined tax rate is assigned to rate category
12 twelve as established in subsection (3) of this section. Rates for each
13 of the remaining nineteen categories are determined by multiplying the
14 average combined tax rate by the experience factor associated with each
15 category and carried to four decimal places. Employers who are delinquent
16 in filing their combined tax reports as of October 31 of any year shall
17 be assigned to category twenty for the following calendar year unless the
18 delinquency is corrected prior to December 31 of the year of rate
19 calculation.
20 (6) In addition to required contributions, an employer may make
21 voluntary contributions to the fund to be credited to his or her account.
22 Voluntary contributions by employers may be made up to the amount
23 necessary to qualify for one rate category reduction. Voluntary
24 contributions received after February 28 shall not be used in rate
25 calculations for the same calendar year.
26 (7) As used in sections 48-648 to 48-654, the term payroll means the
27 total amount of wages during a calendar year, except as otherwise
28 provided in section 48-654, by which the combined tax was measured.
29 Sec. 7. Section 48-657, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 48-657 (1)(a) If any employer defaults in any payment of combined
-19-

2025 2025
1 tax or interest, the commissioner may make in any manner feasible and
2 cause to be filed as a secured transaction as provided in article 9,
3 Uniform Commercial Code, and in the real estate mortgage records of any
4 county in which such employer is engaged in business or owns real or
5 personal property, a statement, under oath, showing the amount of
6 combined tax and interest in default, which statement, when filed for
7 record, shall operate as a lien and mortgage on all of the real and
8 personal property of the employer, subject only to the liens of prior
9 record, and the property of such employer shall be subject to seizure and
10 sale for the payment of such combined taxes and interest. Such lien on
11 personal property may be enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by
12 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, and such liens on real estate may be
13 enforced or dissolved in the manner provided by Chapter 25, article 21,
14 in the enforcing and dissolving of real estate mortgages. This
15 subdivision shall only apply to liens filed prior to May 1, 1999.
16 (b) A lien for unpaid combined taxes filed or recorded pursuant to
17 subdivision (a) of this subsection shall lapse at the earlier of its
18 expiration date or the fifth anniversary of the filing or recording date,
19 unless the commissioner files a notice of continuation in the place of
20 the original filing or recording and with the appropriate filing officer
21 in the manner provided for in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
22 Enforcement Act before such lien lapses. A notice of continuation shall
23 include all of the information required by the act, the date of the
24 filing or recording of the original lien, and a statement that the
25 original lien is to be continued for ten years. Thereafter, such lien
26 shall be enforced and notices of continuation filed in accordance with
27 the act.
28 (c) On and after May 1, 1999, if any employer defaults in any
29 payment of combined tax or interest, the commissioner may file a lien
30 against such employer in accordance with the Uniform State Tax Lien
31 Registration and Enforcement Act. Such liens shall set forth the amount
-20-

2025 2025

2 enforced as provided in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
3 Enforcement Act.

13 Workforce Development Program Cash State Unemployment Insurance Trust
14 Fund unemployment combined tax and interest due under the Employment
15 Security Law on wages paid to individuals employed in the performance of
16 such contract.
17 (3) No contract referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall
18 be entered into by the State of Nebraska, a department or agency thereof,
19 an officer or officers, or a board referred to in such subsection unless
20 the contract contains the proviso mentioned in such subsection.
21 (4) Before final payment may be made on the final three percent of
22 any such contract awarded on or after June 1, 1957, the State of
23 Nebraska, department or agency thereof, officer or officers, or board
24 awarding the contract must have received from the contractor a written
25 clearance from the commissioner certifying that all payments then due of
26 combined tax or interest which may have arisen under such contract have
27 been made by the contractor or his or her subcontractor to the
28 Unemployment Compensation Fund.
29 (5) The final three percent of any such contract referred to in
30 subsection (4) of this section may be paid if the contractor has supplied
