8 VIII-1 The necessary revenue of the state and its governmental
9 subdivisions shall be raised by taxation in such manner as the
10 Legislature may direct. Notwithstanding Article I, section 16, Article

LR12CA LR12CA
2025 2025
1 establish a separate class of motor vehicles consisting of those owned
2 and held for resale by motor vehicle dealers which shall be taxed in the
3 manner and to the extent provided by the Legislature and may also
4 establish a separate class for trucks, trailers, semitrailers, truck-
5 tractors, or combinations thereof, consisting of those owned by residents

10 county; (4) the Legislature may provide that agricultural land and
11 horticultural land, as defined by the Legislature, shall constitute a
12 separate and distinct class of property for purposes of taxation and may
13 provide for a different method of taxing agricultural land and
14 horticultural land which results in values that are not uniform and
15 proportionate with all other real property and franchises but which
16 results in values that are uniform and proportionate upon all property
17 within the class of agricultural land and horticultural land; (5) the
18 Legislature may enact laws to provide that the value of land actively
19 devoted to agricultural or horticultural use shall for property tax
20 purposes be that value which such land has for agricultural or
21 horticultural use without regard to any value which such land might have

23 standards and methods for the determination of the value of real property

27 specifically designated type, use, user, or owner of property or
28 franchise from discriminatory state or local taxation, such property or
29 franchise shall constitute a separate class of property or franchise
30 under the laws of the State of Nebraska, and such property or franchise
31 may not be taken into consideration in determining whether taxes are
-2-

9 governmental subdivision shall be the same for all classes of taxed
10 property and franchises. Taxes uniform as to class of property or the
11 ownership or use thereof may be levied by valuation or otherwise upon
12 classes of intangible property as the Legislature may determine, and such
13 intangible property held in trust or otherwise for the purpose of funding
14 pension, profit-sharing, or other employee benefit plans as defined by
15 the Legislature may be declared exempt from taxation. Taxes other than
16 property taxes may be authorized by law. Existing revenue laws shall
17 continue in effect until changed by the Legislature.

7 of any co-owner's interest; or
8 (e) The distribution of a legal entity's property to a spouse or
9 former spouse in exchange for the interest of the spouse in the legal
10 entity in connection with a property settlement agreement or a decree of
11 dissolution of a marriage or legal separation.
12 (8)(a) The full cash value of qualified contaminated property may be
13 transferred to a replacement property that is acquired or newly
14 constructed as a replacement for the qualified contaminated property, if
15 the replacement real property has a fair market value that is comparable
16 to the fair market value of the qualified contaminated property if that
17 property were not contaminated. This subdivision applies only to
18 replacement property that is acquired or newly constructed within five
19 years after ownership in the qualified contaminated property is sold or
20 otherwise transferred.
21 (b) If the remediation of the environmental problems on qualified
22 contaminated property requires the destruction of, or results in
23 substantial damage to, a structure located on that property, the term
24 "new construction" does not include the repair of a substantially damaged
25 structure, or the construction of a structure replacing a destroyed
26 structure on the qualified contaminated property, that is performed after
27 the remediation of the environmental problems on that property, provided
28 that the repaired or replacement structure is similar in size, utility,
29 and function to the original structure.
30 (c) For purposes of this subsection, the term "qualified
31 contaminated property" means residential or nonresidential real property

1 that:
2 (i) In the case of residential real property, is rendered
3 uninhabitable, and in the case of nonresidential real property, is
4 rendered unusable, as the result of either environmental problems, in the
5 nature of and including, but not limited to, the presence of toxic or
6 hazardous materials, or the remediation of those environmental problems,
7 except where the existence of the environmental problems was known to the
8 owner, or to a related individual or entity as described in subdivision
9 (8)(d) of this section, at the time the real property was acquired or
10 constructed. For purposes of this subdivision, residential real property

12 by or associated with the environmental problems, is unfit for human
13 habitation, and nonresidential real property is unusable if that
14 property, as a result of health hazards caused by or associated with the
15 environmental problems, is unhealthy and unsuitable for occupancy;
16 (ii) Is located on a site that has been designated as a toxic or
17 environmental hazard or as an environmental cleanup site by an agency of
18 the State of Nebraska or the federal government; and
19 (iii) Has not been rendered uninhabitable or unusable, as described
20 in subdivision (8)(c)(i) of this section, by any act or omission in which
21 an owner of that real property participated or acquiesced.
22 (d) It shall be rebuttably presumed that an owner of the real
23 property participated or acquiesced in an act or omission that rendered
24 the real property uninhabitable or unusable, as applicable, if that owner
25 is related to any individual or entity that committed that act or
26 omission in any of the following ways:
27 (i) Is a spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling
28 of that individual;
29 (ii) Is a corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of that entity;
30 (iii) Is an owner of, or has control of, that entity; or
31 (iv) Is owned or controlled by that entity.
