11 determine whether a temporary expansion is to be approved or denied. Such
12 agent shall follow criteria established by the local governing body in
13 making the determination. The determination of the agent shall be
14 considered the determination of the local governing body unless otherwise

20 governing body shall be that of the county within which the premises for
21 which the temporary expansion is requested are located.

23 applicant does not qualify for a temporary expansion, the temporary
24 expansion shall be denied by the local governing body.
25 (f) The city, village, or county clerk shall deliver confirmation of
26 the temporary expansion to the licensee upon receipt of any fee or tax
27 imposed by such city, village, or county.
