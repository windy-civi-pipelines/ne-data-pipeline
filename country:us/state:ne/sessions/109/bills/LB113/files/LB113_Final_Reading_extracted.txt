19 pursuant to section 53-123.17, or a promotional farmers market special

23 purchase and to import, from such persons as are entitled to sell the
24 same, wines or spirits to be used solely as ingredients and for the sole

28 resale up to three five thousand five hundred gallons per calendar year
29 of microdistilled products produced at its licensed premises directly to

30 a common nuisance. The local governing body shall file the designation or

26 (f) The city, village, or county clerk shall deliver confirmation of
27 the temporary expansion to the licensee upon receipt of any fee or tax
28 imposed by such city, village, or county.

19 pursuant to section 53-123.17, or a promotional farmers market special

30 a common nuisance. The local governing body shall file the designation or

-6-

LB113 LB113

27 the temporary expansion to the licensee upon receipt of any fee or tax
28 imposed by such city, village, or county.
