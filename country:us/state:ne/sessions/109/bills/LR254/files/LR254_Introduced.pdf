ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 254
Introduced by Clements, 2.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine potential adjustments to the collection of motor vehicle tax, motor
vehicle tax distribution schemes, motor vehicle fees, and other revenue sources
due to the potential elimination of the Nebraska inheritance tax. The study
shall include, but need not be limited to, an examination of the following:
(1) The current motor vehicle tax distribution, motor vehicle fees and
distribution, civil fees and other revenue sources;
(2) The potential adjustment to such current revenue sources to provide
adequate funds for necessary county government duties and services; and
(3) The potential elimination of unnecessary costly statutory requirements
for counties related to motor vehicles.
In conducting this interim study, the Transportation and
Telecommunications Committee of the Legislature may confer with other standing
committees of the Legislature, state agencies, county officials and employees,
and other stakeholders.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee of the
Legislature shall be designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the
purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
