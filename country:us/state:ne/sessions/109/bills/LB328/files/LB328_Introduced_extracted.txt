25 sufficient to provide an adequate workforce for such site; and the
26 appropriate level of state investment necessary to position Nebraska as a
27 nationally or globally competitive location for site selection targeting
28 various sectors, including, but not limited to, advanced manufacturing,
29 trade, bioscience, agribusiness, warehousing and supply chain logistics,
