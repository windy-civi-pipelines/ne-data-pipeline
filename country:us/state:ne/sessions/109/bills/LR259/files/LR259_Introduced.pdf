LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 259
Introduced by Armendariz, 18; Storer, 43.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the feasibility, benefits, and framework for establishing a high school
agriculture student exchange program within Nebraska modeled after foreign
student exchange programs to foster cross-regional learning, cultural exchange,
and deeper appreciation for Nebraska's agricultural heritage and rural life.
The study shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:
(1) The feasibility and structure of such a program, including exchange
duration, school credit recognition, and housing arrangements;
(2) The potential for collaboration with local school districts, the State
Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Cooperative
Extension Service of the University of Nebraska, including the state 4-H
program, and Future Farmers of America;
(3) The benefits to student participants, host communities, and Nebraska's
agricultural education system;
(4) Potential models, including urban-to-rural exchanges within Nebraska,
as well as interstate exchanges with other agricultural regions;
(5) Considerations to ensure student participation from low-income urban
areas; and
(6) Potential funding sources, including state appropriations, federal
grants, and private sponsorships.
In conducting this interim study, the Education Committee of the
Legislature may confer with other standing committees of the Legislature, state
agencies, and other stakeholders.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
