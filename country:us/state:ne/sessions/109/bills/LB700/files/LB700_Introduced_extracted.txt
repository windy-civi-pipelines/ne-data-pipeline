24 (i) (a) The peace officer may release a juvenile taken into
25 temporary custody under section 29-401 or subdivision (1), (2), or (7) of

-15-
LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 of the court. The notice shall also contain a concise statement of the
2 reasons such juvenile was taken into custody. The peace officer shall
3 deliver one copy of the notice to such juvenile and require such juvenile
4 or his or her parent, guardian, other custodian, or adult relative, or
5 both, to sign a written promise that such signer will appear at the time
6 and place designated in the notice. Upon the execution of the promise to
7 appear, the peace officer shall immediately release such juvenile. The
8 peace officer shall, as soon as practicable, file one copy of the notice

10 court, also file a copy of the notice with the court or the officer
11 appointed by the court for such purpose; or
12 (iii) (c) The peace officer may retain temporary custody of a
13 juvenile taken into temporary custody under section 29-401 or subdivision
14 (1), (2), or (3) of section 43-248 and deliver the juvenile, if

16 available information regarding such juvenile to the probation officer.
17 The probation officer shall determine the need for detention of the
18 juvenile as provided in section 43-260.01. Upon determining that the
19 juvenile should be placed in detention or an alternative to detention and
20 securing placement in such setting by the probation officer, the peace
21 officer shall implement the probation officer's decision to release or to
22 detain and place the juvenile. When secure detention of a juvenile is
23 necessary, such detention shall occur within a juvenile detention
24 facility except:
25 (A) (i) When a juvenile described in subdivision (1) or (2) of
26 section 43-247, except for a status offender, is taken into temporary
27 custody within a metropolitan statistical area and where no juvenile
28 detention facility is reasonably available, the juvenile may be
29 delivered, for temporary custody not to exceed six hours, to a secure
30 area of a jail or other facility intended or used for the detention of
31 adults solely for the purposes of identifying the juvenile and
-16-
LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 ascertaining his or her health and well-being and for safekeeping while
2 awaiting transport to an appropriate juvenile placement or release to a
3 responsible party;
4 (B) (ii) When a juvenile described in subdivision (1) or (2) of
5 section 43-247, except for a status offender, is taken into temporary
6 custody outside of a metropolitan statistical area and where no juvenile
7 detention facility is reasonably available, the juvenile may be
8 delivered, for temporary custody not to exceed twenty-four hours
9 excluding nonjudicial days and while awaiting an initial court
10 appearance, to a secure area of a jail or other facility intended or used
11 for the detention of adults solely for the purposes of identifying the
12 juvenile and ascertaining his or her health and well-being and for
13 safekeeping while awaiting transport to an appropriate juvenile placement
14 or release to a responsible party;
15 (C) (iii) Whenever a juvenile is held in a secure area of any jail
16 or other facility intended or used for the detention of adults, there
17 shall be no verbal, visual, or physical contact between the juvenile and
18 any incarcerated adult and there shall be adequate staff to supervise and
19 monitor the juvenile's activities at all times. This subdivision shall
20 not apply to a juvenile charged with a felony as an adult in county or
21 district court if he or she is sixteen years of age or older;
22 (D) (iv) If a juvenile is under sixteen years of age or is a
23 juvenile as described in subdivision (3) of section 43-247, he or she
24 shall not be placed within a secure area of a jail or other facility
25 intended or used for the detention of adults;
26 (v) If, within the time limits specified in subdivision (1)(c)(i) or
27 (1)(c)(ii) of this section, a felony charge is filed against the juvenile
28 as an adult in county or district court, he or she may be securely held
29 in a jail or other facility intended or used for the detention of adults
30 beyond the specified time limits;
31 (E) (vi) A status offender or nonoffender taken into temporary
-17-
LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 custody shall not be held in a secure area of a jail or other facility
2 intended or used for the detention of adults; and
3 (F) (vii) A juvenile described in subdivision (1) or (2) of section
4 43-247, except for a status offender, may be held in a secure area of a
5 jail or other facility intended or used for the detention of adults for
6 up to six hours before and six hours after any court appearance.
7 (2) A juvenile taken into custody pursuant to a legal warrant of
8 arrest shall be delivered to a probation officer who shall determine the
9 need for detention of the juvenile as provided in section 43-260.01. If
10 detention is not required, the juvenile may be released without bond if
11 such release is in the best interests of the juvenile, the safety of the
12 community is not at risk, and the court that issued the warrant is
13 notified that the juvenile had been taken into custody and was released.
14 (3) In determining the appropriate temporary placement or
15 alternative to detention of a juvenile under this section, the peace
16 officer shall select the placement or alternative which is least
17 restrictive of the juvenile's freedom so long as such placement or
18 alternative is compatible with the best interests of the juvenile and the
19 safety of the community. Any alternative to detention shall cause the
20 least restriction of the juvenile's freedom of movement consistent with
21 the best interests of the juvenile and the safety of the community.
22 (4) When a juvenile is taken into temporary custody pursuant to
23 subdivision (4) of section 43-248, the peace officer shall deliver the
24 juvenile to the enrolled school of such juvenile.
25 (5) When a juvenile is taken into temporary custody pursuant to
26 subdivision (5), (6), or (7) of section 43-248, and not released under
27 subdivision (1)(b)(i) (1)(a) of this section, the peace officer shall
28 deliver the custody of such juvenile to the Department of Health and
29 Human Services which shall make a temporary placement of the juvenile in
30 the least restrictive environment consistent with the best interests of
31 the juvenile as determined by the department. The department shall
-18-
LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 supervise such placement and, if necessary, consent to any necessary
2 emergency medical, psychological, or psychiatric treatment for such
3 juvenile. The department shall have no other authority with regard to
4 such temporary custody until or unless there is an order by the court
5 placing the juvenile in the custody of the department. If the peace
6 officer delivers temporary custody of the juvenile pursuant to this
7 subsection, the peace officer shall make a full written report to the
8 county attorney within twenty-four hours of taking such juvenile into
9 temporary custody. If a court order of temporary custody is not issued
10 within forty-eight hours of taking the juvenile into custody, the
11 temporary custody by the department shall terminate and the juvenile
12 shall be returned to the custody of his or her parent, guardian,
13 custodian, or adult relative.
14 (6) If the peace officer takes the juvenile into temporary custody
15 pursuant to subdivision (8) of section 43-248, the peace officer may
16 place the juvenile at a mental health facility for evaluation and
17 emergency treatment or may deliver the juvenile to the Department of
18 Health and Human Services as provided in subsection (5) of this section.
19 At the time of the admission or turning the juvenile over to the
20 department, the peace officer responsible for taking the juvenile into
21 custody pursuant to subdivision (8) of section 43-248 shall execute a
22 written certificate as prescribed by the department which will indicate
23 that the peace officer believes the juvenile to be mentally ill and
24 dangerous, a summary of the subject's behavior supporting such
25 allegations, and that the harm described in section 71-908 is likely to
26 occur before proceedings before a juvenile court may be invoked to obtain
27 custody of the juvenile. A copy of the certificate shall be forwarded to
28 the county attorney. The peace officer shall notify the juvenile's
29 parents, guardian, custodian, or adult relative of the juvenile's
30 placement.
31 Sec. 11. Section 43-253, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
-19-
LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 2024, is amended to read:
2 43-253 (1) Upon delivery to the probation officer of a juvenile who
3 has been taken into temporary custody under section 29-401, 43-248, or
4 43-250, the probation officer shall immediately investigate the situation
5 of the juvenile and the nature and circumstances of the events
6 surrounding his or her being taken into custody. Such investigation may
7 be by informal means when appropriate.
8 (2) The probation officer's decision to release the juvenile from
9 custody or place the juvenile in detention or an alternative to detention
10 shall be based upon the results of the standardized juvenile detention
11 screening instrument described in section 43-260.01.
12 (3) No juvenile who has been taken into temporary custody under
13 subdivision (1)(b)(iii) (1)(c) of section 43-250 or subsection (6) of
14 section 43-286.01 or pursuant to an alleged violation of an order for
15 conditional release shall be detained in any detention facility or be
16 subject to an alternative to detention infringing upon the juvenile's
17 liberty interest for longer than twenty-four hours, excluding nonjudicial
18 days, after having been taken into custody unless such juvenile has
19 appeared personally before a court of competent jurisdiction for a
20 hearing to determine if continued detention, services, or supervision is
21 necessary. The juvenile shall be represented by counsel at the hearing.
22 Whether such counsel shall be provided at the cost of the county shall be
23 determined as provided in subsection (1) of section 43-272. If continued
24 secure detention is ordered, such detention shall be in a juvenile
25 detention facility , except that a juvenile charged with a felony as an
26 adult in county or district court may be held in an adult jail as set
27 forth in subdivision (1)(c)(v) of section 43-250. A juvenile placed in an
28 alternative to detention, but not in detention, may waive this hearing
29 through counsel.
30 (4) When the probation officer deems it to be in the best interests
31 of the juvenile, the probation officer shall immediately release such
-20-
LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 juvenile to the custody of his or her parent. If the juvenile has both a
2 custodial and a noncustodial parent and the probation officer deems that
3 release of the juvenile to the custodial parent is not in the best
4 interests of the juvenile, the probation officer shall, if it is deemed
5 to be in the best interests of the juvenile, attempt to contact the
6 noncustodial parent, if any, of the juvenile and to release the juvenile
7 to such noncustodial parent. If such release is not possible or not
8 deemed to be in the best interests of the juvenile, the probation officer
9 may release the juvenile to the custody of a legal guardian, a
10 responsible adult relative, or another responsible adult person.
11 (5) The court may admit such juvenile to bail by bond in such amount
12 and on such conditions and security as the court, in its sole discretion,
13 shall determine, or the court may proceed as provided in section 43-254.
14 In no case shall the court or probation officer release such juvenile if
15 it appears that:
16 (a) The physical safety of persons in the community would be
17 seriously threatened; or
18 (b) Detention is necessary to secure the presence of the juvenile at
19 the next hearing, as evidenced by a demonstrable record of willful
20 failure to appear at a scheduled court hearing within the last twelve
21 months.
22 Sec. 12. The Department of Health and Human Services and Office of
23 Probation Administration shall use day reporting and evening reporting
24 centers as appropriate for juveniles who are being provided services
25 under the Nebraska Juvenile Code. The department and office may adopt and
26 promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to select, oversee, and
27 reimburse such centers.
28 Sec. 13. A juvenile who has been adjudicated under the Nebraska
29 Juvenile Code shall not be transferred out of state by a county or any
30 state agency unless necessary for emergency medical or mental treatment
31 services.

1 Sec. 14. (1) This section applies beginning January 1, 2026.
2 (2) Any adjudication of a juvenile under subdivision (1) or (2) of

4 confidentiality of the identity of the juvenile. This applies to all
5 stages of such proceedings, including before, during, or after
6 adjudication and disposition and during any post-disposition proceedings.
7 (3) A court shall release information required to be confidential by
8 this section:
9 (a) To any individual; public or private agency, institution,
10 facility, or clinic; or governmental entity which is providing services
11 directly to the juvenile;
12 (b) To any court which has jurisdiction of the juvenile upon such
13 court's request;
14 (c) Upon written request by the office of Public Counsel, including
15 the office of Inspector General of Nebraska Child Welfare and office of
16 Inspector General of the Nebraska Correctional System;
17 (d) To any person, at the request of the juvenile;
18 (e) To law enforcement officers, county attorneys, and city
19 attorneys;

21 juvenile;
22 (g) To the Department of Health and Human Services;
23 (h) To persons engaged in bona fide research, with the permission of
24 the court or the State Court Administrator, only if the research results
25 in no disclosure of the juvenile's identity and protects the
26 confidentiality of the juvenile;
27 (i) To a law enforcement agency if the juvenile applies for
28 employment with the law enforcement agency; and
29 (j) To public or private entities responsible for locating or
30 assisting in the location of a juvenile who is a fugitive from justice or
31 otherwise missing, except that this shall not authorize the dissemination
-22-
LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 of any information required to be confidential by this section to the
2 media or on social media, unless there is reason to believe the juvenile
3 has been kidnapped or is at risk of physical harm.
4 (4) Any person receiving confidential information under subsection
5 (3) of this section shall maintain the confidentiality of such
6 information and of the juvenile's identity.
7 Sec. 15. Section 43-2,129, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
8 2024, is amended to read:
9 43-2,129 Sections 43-245 to 43-2,129 and sections 12 to 14 of this

12 43-249, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and sections 28-105.01,
13 29-2204, 43-245, 43-250, 43-253, and 43-2,129, Revised Statutes

-15-

LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 of the court. The notice shall also contain a concise statement of the
2 reasons such juvenile was taken into custody. The peace officer shall
3 deliver one copy of the notice to such juvenile and require such juvenile
4 or his or her parent, guardian, other custodian, or adult relative, or
5 both, to sign a written promise that such signer will appear at the time
6 and place designated in the notice. Upon the execution of the promise to
7 appear, the peace officer shall immediately release such juvenile. The
8 peace officer shall, as soon as practicable, file one copy of the notice

10 court, also file a copy of the notice with the court or the officer
11 appointed by the court for such purpose; or
12 (iii) (c) The peace officer may retain temporary custody of a
13 juvenile taken into temporary custody under section 29-401 or subdivision
14 (1), (2), or (3) of section 43-248 and deliver the juvenile, if

16 available information regarding such juvenile to the probation officer.
17 The probation officer shall determine the need for detention of the
18 juvenile as provided in section 43-260.01. Upon determining that the
19 juvenile should be placed in detention or an alternative to detention and
20 securing placement in such setting by the probation officer, the peace
21 officer shall implement the probation officer's decision to release or to
22 detain and place the juvenile. When secure detention of a juvenile is
23 necessary, such detention shall occur within a juvenile detention
24 facility except:
25 (A) (i) When a juvenile described in subdivision (1) or (2) of
26 section 43-247, except for a status offender, is taken into temporary
27 custody within a metropolitan statistical area and where no juvenile
28 detention facility is reasonably available, the juvenile may be
29 delivered, for temporary custody not to exceed six hours, to a secure
30 area of a jail or other facility intended or used for the detention of
31 adults solely for the purposes of identifying the juvenile and
-16-

LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 ascertaining his or her health and well-being and for safekeeping while
2 awaiting transport to an appropriate juvenile placement or release to a
3 responsible party;
4 (B) (ii) When a juvenile described in subdivision (1) or (2) of
5 section 43-247, except for a status offender, is taken into temporary
6 custody outside of a metropolitan statistical area and where no juvenile
7 detention facility is reasonably available, the juvenile may be
8 delivered, for temporary custody not to exceed twenty-four hours
9 excluding nonjudicial days and while awaiting an initial court
10 appearance, to a secure area of a jail or other facility intended or used
11 for the detention of adults solely for the purposes of identifying the
12 juvenile and ascertaining his or her health and well-being and for
13 safekeeping while awaiting transport to an appropriate juvenile placement
14 or release to a responsible party;
15 (C) (iii) Whenever a juvenile is held in a secure area of any jail
16 or other facility intended or used for the detention of adults, there
17 shall be no verbal, visual, or physical contact between the juvenile and
18 any incarcerated adult and there shall be adequate staff to supervise and
19 monitor the juvenile's activities at all times. This subdivision shall
20 not apply to a juvenile charged with a felony as an adult in county or
21 district court if he or she is sixteen years of age or older;
22 (D) (iv) If a juvenile is under sixteen years of age or is a
23 juvenile as described in subdivision (3) of section 43-247, he or she
24 shall not be placed within a secure area of a jail or other facility
25 intended or used for the detention of adults;

30 beyond the specified time limits;
31 (E) (vi) A status offender or nonoffender taken into temporary
-17-

LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 custody shall not be held in a secure area of a jail or other facility
2 intended or used for the detention of adults; and
3 (F) (vii) A juvenile described in subdivision (1) or (2) of section
4 43-247, except for a status offender, may be held in a secure area of a
5 jail or other facility intended or used for the detention of adults for
6 up to six hours before and six hours after any court appearance.
7 (2) A juvenile taken into custody pursuant to a legal warrant of
8 arrest shall be delivered to a probation officer who shall determine the
9 need for detention of the juvenile as provided in section 43-260.01. If
10 detention is not required, the juvenile may be released without bond if
11 such release is in the best interests of the juvenile, the safety of the
12 community is not at risk, and the court that issued the warrant is
13 notified that the juvenile had been taken into custody and was released.
14 (3) In determining the appropriate temporary placement or
15 alternative to detention of a juvenile under this section, the peace
16 officer shall select the placement or alternative which is least
17 restrictive of the juvenile's freedom so long as such placement or
18 alternative is compatible with the best interests of the juvenile and the
19 safety of the community. Any alternative to detention shall cause the
20 least restriction of the juvenile's freedom of movement consistent with
21 the best interests of the juvenile and the safety of the community.
22 (4) When a juvenile is taken into temporary custody pursuant to
23 subdivision (4) of section 43-248, the peace officer shall deliver the
24 juvenile to the enrolled school of such juvenile.
25 (5) When a juvenile is taken into temporary custody pursuant to
26 subdivision (5), (6), or (7) of section 43-248, and not released under
27 subdivision (1)(b)(i) (1)(a) of this section, the peace officer shall
28 deliver the custody of such juvenile to the Department of Health and
29 Human Services which shall make a temporary placement of the juvenile in
30 the least restrictive environment consistent with the best interests of
31 the juvenile as determined by the department. The department shall
-18-

LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 supervise such placement and, if necessary, consent to any necessary
2 emergency medical, psychological, or psychiatric treatment for such
3 juvenile. The department shall have no other authority with regard to
4 such temporary custody until or unless there is an order by the court
5 placing the juvenile in the custody of the department. If the peace
6 officer delivers temporary custody of the juvenile pursuant to this
7 subsection, the peace officer shall make a full written report to the
8 county attorney within twenty-four hours of taking such juvenile into
9 temporary custody. If a court order of temporary custody is not issued
10 within forty-eight hours of taking the juvenile into custody, the
11 temporary custody by the department shall terminate and the juvenile
12 shall be returned to the custody of his or her parent, guardian,
13 custodian, or adult relative.
14 (6) If the peace officer takes the juvenile into temporary custody
15 pursuant to subdivision (8) of section 43-248, the peace officer may
16 place the juvenile at a mental health facility for evaluation and
17 emergency treatment or may deliver the juvenile to the Department of
18 Health and Human Services as provided in subsection (5) of this section.
19 At the time of the admission or turning the juvenile over to the
20 department, the peace officer responsible for taking the juvenile into
21 custody pursuant to subdivision (8) of section 43-248 shall execute a
22 written certificate as prescribed by the department which will indicate
23 that the peace officer believes the juvenile to be mentally ill and
24 dangerous, a summary of the subject's behavior supporting such
25 allegations, and that the harm described in section 71-908 is likely to
26 occur before proceedings before a juvenile court may be invoked to obtain
27 custody of the juvenile. A copy of the certificate shall be forwarded to
28 the county attorney. The peace officer shall notify the juvenile's
29 parents, guardian, custodian, or adult relative of the juvenile's
30 placement.
31 Sec. 11. Section 43-253, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
-19-

LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 2024, is amended to read:
2 43-253 (1) Upon delivery to the probation officer of a juvenile who
3 has been taken into temporary custody under section 29-401, 43-248, or
4 43-250, the probation officer shall immediately investigate the situation
5 of the juvenile and the nature and circumstances of the events
6 surrounding his or her being taken into custody. Such investigation may
7 be by informal means when appropriate.
8 (2) The probation officer's decision to release the juvenile from
9 custody or place the juvenile in detention or an alternative to detention
10 shall be based upon the results of the standardized juvenile detention
11 screening instrument described in section 43-260.01.
12 (3) No juvenile who has been taken into temporary custody under
13 subdivision (1)(b)(iii) (1)(c) of section 43-250 or subsection (6) of
14 section 43-286.01 or pursuant to an alleged violation of an order for
15 conditional release shall be detained in any detention facility or be
16 subject to an alternative to detention infringing upon the juvenile's
17 liberty interest for longer than twenty-four hours, excluding nonjudicial
18 days, after having been taken into custody unless such juvenile has
19 appeared personally before a court of competent jurisdiction for a
20 hearing to determine if continued detention, services, or supervision is
21 necessary. The juvenile shall be represented by counsel at the hearing.
22 Whether such counsel shall be provided at the cost of the county shall be
23 determined as provided in subsection (1) of section 43-272. If continued
24 secure detention is ordered, such detention shall be in a juvenile
25 detention facility , except that a juvenile charged with a felony as an
26 adult in county or district court may be held in an adult jail as set
27 forth in subdivision (1)(c)(v) of section 43-250. A juvenile placed in an
28 alternative to detention, but not in detention, may waive this hearing
29 through counsel.
30 (4) When the probation officer deems it to be in the best interests
31 of the juvenile, the probation officer shall immediately release such
-20-

LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 juvenile to the custody of his or her parent. If the juvenile has both a
2 custodial and a noncustodial parent and the probation officer deems that
3 release of the juvenile to the custodial parent is not in the best
4 interests of the juvenile, the probation officer shall, if it is deemed
5 to be in the best interests of the juvenile, attempt to contact the
6 noncustodial parent, if any, of the juvenile and to release the juvenile
7 to such noncustodial parent. If such release is not possible or not
8 deemed to be in the best interests of the juvenile, the probation officer
9 may release the juvenile to the custody of a legal guardian, a
10 responsible adult relative, or another responsible adult person.
11 (5) The court may admit such juvenile to bail by bond in such amount
12 and on such conditions and security as the court, in its sole discretion,
13 shall determine, or the court may proceed as provided in section 43-254.
14 In no case shall the court or probation officer release such juvenile if
15 it appears that:
16 (a) The physical safety of persons in the community would be
17 seriously threatened; or
18 (b) Detention is necessary to secure the presence of the juvenile at
19 the next hearing, as evidenced by a demonstrable record of willful
20 failure to appear at a scheduled court hearing within the last twelve
21 months.
22 Sec. 12. The Department of Health and Human Services and Office of
23 Probation Administration shall use day reporting and evening reporting
24 centers as appropriate for juveniles who are being provided services
25 under the Nebraska Juvenile Code. The department and office may adopt and
26 promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to select, oversee, and
27 reimburse such centers.
28 Sec. 13. A juvenile who has been adjudicated under the Nebraska
29 Juvenile Code shall not be transferred out of state by a county or any
30 state agency unless necessary for emergency medical or mental treatment
31 services.

1 Sec. 14. (1) This section applies beginning January 1, 2026.
2 (2) Any adjudication of a juvenile under subdivision (1) or (2) of

4 confidentiality of the identity of the juvenile. This applies to all
5 stages of such proceedings, including before, during, or after
6 adjudication and disposition and during any post-disposition proceedings.
7 (3) A court shall release information required to be confidential by
8 this section:
9 (a) To any individual; public or private agency, institution,
10 facility, or clinic; or governmental entity which is providing services
11 directly to the juvenile;
12 (b) To any court which has jurisdiction of the juvenile upon such
13 court's request;
14 (c) Upon written request by the office of Public Counsel, including
15 the office of Inspector General of Nebraska Child Welfare and office of
16 Inspector General of the Nebraska Correctional System;

21 juvenile;
22 (g) To the Department of Health and Human Services;
23 (h) To persons engaged in bona fide research, with the permission of
24 the court or the State Court Administrator, only if the research results
25 in no disclosure of the juvenile's identity and protects the
26 confidentiality of the juvenile;
27 (i) To a law enforcement agency if the juvenile applies for
28 employment with the law enforcement agency; and
29 (j) To public or private entities responsible for locating or
30 assisting in the location of a juvenile who is a fugitive from justice or
31 otherwise missing, except that this shall not authorize the dissemination
-22-

LB700 LB700
2025 2025
1 of any information required to be confidential by this section to the
2 media or on social media, unless there is reason to believe the juvenile
3 has been kidnapped or is at risk of physical harm.
4 (4) Any person receiving confidential information under subsection
5 (3) of this section shall maintain the confidentiality of such
6 information and of the juvenile's identity.
7 Sec. 15. Section 43-2,129, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
8 2024, is amended to read:
9 43-2,129 Sections 43-245 to 43-2,129 and sections 12 to 14 of this

12 43-249, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and sections 28-105.01,
13 29-2204, 43-245, 43-250, 43-253, and 43-2,129, Revised Statutes
