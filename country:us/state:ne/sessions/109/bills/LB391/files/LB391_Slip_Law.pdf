income for federal income tax purposes;
(b) There shall be subtracted that portion of the total dividends and
other income received from a regulated investment company which is attributable
to obligations described in subdivision (a) of this subsection as reported to
the recipient by the regulated investment company;
(c) There shall be added interest or dividends received by the owner of
obligations of the District of Columbia, other states of the United States, or
their political subdivisions, authorities, commissions, or instrumentalities to
the extent excluded in the computation of gross income for federal income tax
purposes except that such interest or dividends shall not be added if received

(d) There shall be added that portion of the total dividends and other
income received from a regulated investment company which is attributable to
obligations described in subdivision (c) of this subsection and excluded for
federal income tax purposes as reported to the recipient by the regulated
investment company; and
(e)(i) Any amount subtracted under this subsection shall be reduced by any
interest on indebtedness incurred to carry the obligations or securities
described in this subsection or the investment in the regulated investment
company and by any expenses incurred in the production of interest or dividend
income described in this subsection to the extent that such expenses, including
amortizable bond premiums, are deductible in determining federal taxable
income.
(ii) Any amount added under this subsection shall be reduced by any
expenses incurred in the production of such income to the extent disallowed in
the computation of federal taxable income.
(2) There shall be allowed a net operating loss derived from or connected
with Nebraska sources computed under rules and regulations adopted and
promulgated by the Tax Commissioner consistent, to the extent possible under
the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, with the laws of the United States. For a
resident individual, estate, or trust, the net operating loss computed on the
federal income tax return shall be adjusted by the modifications contained in
this section. For a nonresident individual, estate, or trust or for a partial-
year resident individual, the net operating loss computed on the federal return
shall be adjusted by the modifications contained in this section and any
carryovers or carrybacks shall be limited to the portion of the loss derived
from or connected with Nebraska sources.
(3) There shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income for all

Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, and is included in federal adjusted gross income.
(4) Federal adjusted gross income, or, for a fiduciary, federal taxable
income shall be modified to exclude the portion of the income or loss received
from a small business corporation with an election in effect under subchapter S

income earned by a corporation subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
that is actually taxed by a foreign country or one of its political
subdivisions at a rate in excess of the maximum federal tax rate for
corporations. The taxpayer may make the computation for each foreign country or
for groups of foreign countries. The portion of the taxes that may be deducted
shall be computed in the following manner:
(a) The amount of federal taxable income from operations within a foreign
taxing jurisdiction shall be reduced by the amount of taxes actually paid to
the foreign jurisdiction that are not deductible solely because the foreign tax
credit was elected on the federal income tax return;
(b) The amount of after-tax income shall be divided by one minus the
maximum tax rate for corporations in the Internal Revenue Code; and
(c) The result of the calculation in subdivision (b) of this subsection
shall be subtracted from the amount of federal taxable income used in
subdivision (a) of this subsection. The result of such calculation, if greater
than zero, shall be subtracted from federal taxable income.
(7) Federal adjusted gross income shall be modified to exclude any amount
repaid by the taxpayer for which a reduction in federal tax is allowed under

(8)(a) Federal adjusted gross income or, for corporations and fiduciaries,
federal taxable income shall be reduced, to the extent included, by income from

purposes, but not to exceed five thousand dollars per married filing separate
return or ten thousand dollars for any other return. With respect to a
qualified rollover within the meaning of section 529 of the Internal Revenue
Code from another state's plan, any interest, earnings, and state contributions

77-1401 to 77-1409 for nonqualified expenses to the extent previously deducted
under subdivision (8)(b) of this section.

Jobs and Growth Tax Act of 2003, under section 168(k) or section 1400L of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for assets placed in service after

or deemed to begin on or after January 1, 2005, under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and twenty percent in each of the next four following
