MLU - 02/06/2025 MLU - 02/06/2025
1 (e)(i) Any amount subtracted under this subsection shall be reduced
2 by any interest on indebtedness incurred to carry the obligations or
3 securities described in this subsection or the investment in the
4 regulated investment company and by any expenses incurred in the
5 production of interest or dividend income described in this subsection to
6 the extent that such expenses, including amortizable bond premiums, are
7 deductible in determining federal taxable income.
8 (ii) Any amount added under this subsection shall be reduced by any
9 expenses incurred in the production of such income to the extent
10 disallowed in the computation of federal taxable income.
11 (2) There shall be allowed a net operating loss derived from or
12 connected with Nebraska sources computed under rules and regulations
13 adopted and promulgated by the Tax Commissioner consistent, to the extent
14 possible under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, with the laws of the
15 United States. For a resident individual, estate, or trust, the net
16 operating loss computed on the federal income tax return shall be

22 derived from or connected with Nebraska sources.
23 (3) There shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income for
24 all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1987, the amount of

27 due under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, and is included in federal
28 adjusted gross income.
29 (4) Federal adjusted gross income, or, for a fiduciary, federal
30 taxable income shall be modified to exclude the portion of the income or

2 liability company organized pursuant to the Nebraska Uniform Limited
3 Liability Company Act that is not derived from or connected with Nebraska
4 sources as determined in section 77-2734.01.

12 political subdivisions at a rate in excess of the maximum federal tax
13 rate for corporations. The taxpayer may make the computation for each
14 foreign country or for groups of foreign countries. The portion of the
15 taxes that may be deducted shall be computed in the following manner:
16 (a) The amount of federal taxable income from operations within a
17 foreign taxing jurisdiction shall be reduced by the amount of taxes
18 actually paid to the foreign jurisdiction that are not deductible solely
19 because the foreign tax credit was elected on the federal income tax
20 return;
21 (b) The amount of after-tax income shall be divided by one minus the
22 maximum tax rate for corporations in the Internal Revenue Code; and
23 (c) The result of the calculation in subdivision (b) of this
