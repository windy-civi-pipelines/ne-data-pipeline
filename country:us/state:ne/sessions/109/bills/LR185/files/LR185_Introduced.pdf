ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 185
Introduced by Hallstrom, 1.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
consider whether Nebraska should adopt the Uniform Law Commission's 2017
Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship, and Other Protective Arrangements Act.
The study should consider Nebraska's current statutory framework for
guardianships and conservatorships and any issues that have arisen since the
current statutes were adopted. The study should also contemplate whether the
Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship, and Other Protective Arrangements Act
might address any such issues or whether it might create different issues.
The study shall include, but not be limited to, a review of statutes, case
law, and potential hearing testimony from individuals who have experience with
Nebraska's current statutes that govern this area of law.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
