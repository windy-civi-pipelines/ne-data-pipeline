28 Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of title for a vehicle,
29 any lien filed electronically shall become part of the electronic
30 certificate of title record created by the county treasurer or department
31 maintained on the electronic title and lien system. If an application for
-4-

LB490 LB490
2025 2025
1 a certificate of title indicates that there is a lien or encumbrance on a
2 vehicle or if a lien or notice of lien has been filed electronically, the
3 department shall retain an electronic certificate of title record and
4 shall note and cancel such liens electronically on the system. The
5 department shall provide access to the electronic certificate of title
6 records for licensed dealers and lienholders who participate in the
7 system by a method determined by the director.
8 (2) Except as provided in section 60-165 or section 6 of this act,
9 the provisions of article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, shall never be
10 construed to apply to or to permit or require the deposit, filing, or
11 other record whatsoever of a security agreement, conveyance intended to
12 operate as a mortgage, trust receipt, conditional sales contract, or
13 similar instrument or any copy of the same covering a vehicle. Any
14 mortgage, conveyance intended to operate as a security agreement as
15 provided by article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, trust receipt,
16 conditional sales contract, or other similar instrument covering a
17 vehicle, if such instrument is accompanied by delivery of such
18 manufacturer's or importer's certificate and followed by actual and
19 continued possession of the same by the holder of such instrument or, in
20 the case of a certificate of title, if a notation of the same has been
21 made electronically as prescribed in subsection (1) of this section or by
22 the county treasurer or department on the face of the certificate of
23 title or on the electronic certificate of title record, shall be valid as
24 against the creditors of the debtor, whether armed with process or not,
25 and subsequent purchasers, secured parties, and other lienholders or
26 claimants but otherwise shall not be valid against them, except that
27 during any period in which a vehicle is inventory, as defined in section
28 9-102, Uniform Commercial Code, held for sale by a person or corporation
29 that is required to be licensed as provided in the Motor Vehicle Industry
30 Regulation Act and is in the business of selling such vehicles, the
31 filing provisions of article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, as applied to
-5-

LB490 LB490
2025 2025
1 inventory, shall apply to a security interest in such vehicle created by
2 such person or corporation as debtor without the notation of lien on the
3 certificate of title. A buyer of a vehicle at retail from a dealer
4 required to be licensed as provided in the Motor Vehicle Industry
5 Regulation Act shall take such vehicle free of any security interest. A
6 purchase-money security interest, as defined in section 9-103, Uniform
7 Commercial Code, in a vehicle is perfected against the rights of judicial
8 lien creditors and execution creditors on and after the date the
9 purchase-money security interest attaches.
10 (3) Subject to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, all liens,
11 security agreements, and encumbrances noted upon a certificate of title
12 or an electronic certificate of title record and all liens noted
13 electronically as prescribed in subsection (1) of this section shall take
14 priority according to the order of time in which the same are noted by
15 the county treasurer or department. Exposure for sale of any vehicle by
16 the owner thereof with the knowledge or with the knowledge and consent of
17 the holder of any lien, security agreement, or encumbrance on such
18 vehicle shall not render the same void or ineffective as against the
19 creditors of such owner or holder of subsequent liens, security
20 agreements, or encumbrances upon such vehicle.
21 (4) The holder of a security agreement, trust receipt, conditional
22 sales contract, or similar instrument, upon presentation of such
23 instrument to the department or to any county treasurer, together with
24 the certificate of title and the fee prescribed for notation of lien, may
25 have a notation of such lien made on the face of such certificate of
26 title. The owner of a vehicle may present a valid out-of-state
27 certificate of title issued to such owner for such vehicle with a
28 notation of lien on such certificate of title and the prescribed fee to
29 the county treasurer or department and have the notation of lien made on
30 the new certificate of title issued pursuant to section 60-144 without
31 presenting a copy of the lien instrument. The county treasurer or the
-6-

LB490 LB490
2025 2025
1 department shall enter the notation and the date thereof over the
2 signature of the person making the notation and the seal of the office.
3 If noted by a county treasurer, he or she shall on that day notify the
4 department which shall note the lien on its records. The county treasurer
5 or the department shall also indicate by appropriate notation and on such
6 instrument itself the fact that such lien has been noted on the
7 certificate of title.
8 (5) A transaction does not create a sale or a security interest in a
9 vehicle, other than an all-terrain vehicle, a utility-type vehicle, or a
10 minibike, merely because it provides that the rental price is permitted
11 or required to be adjusted under the agreement either upward or downward
12 by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the
13 vehicle.
14 (6) The county treasurer or the department, upon receipt of a lien
15 instrument duly signed by the owner in the manner prescribed by law
16 governing such lien instruments together with the fee prescribed for
17 notation of lien, shall notify the first lienholder to deliver to the
18 county treasurer or the department, within fifteen days after the date of
19 notice, the certificate of title to permit notation of such other lien
20 and, after notation of such other lien, the county treasurer or the
21 department shall deliver the certificate of title to the first
22 lienholder. The holder of a certificate of title who refuses to deliver a
23 certificate of title to the county treasurer or the department for the
24 purpose of showing such other lien on such certificate of title within
25 fifteen days after the date of notice shall be liable for damages to such
26 other lienholder for the amount of damages such other lienholder suffered
27 by reason of the holder of the certificate of title refusing to permit
28 the showing of such lien on the certificate of title.
29 (7) Upon receipt of a subsequent lien instrument duly signed by the
30 owner in the manner prescribed by law governing such lien instruments or
31 a notice of lien filed electronically, together with an application for
-7-

LB490 LB490
2025 2025
1 notation of the subsequent lien, the fee prescribed in section 60-154,
2 and, if a printed certificate of title exists, the presentation of the
3 certificate of title, the county treasurer or department shall make
4 notation of such other lien. If the certificate of title is not an
5 electronic certificate of title record, the county treasurer or
6 department, upon receipt of a lien instrument duly signed by the owner in
7 the manner prescribed by law governing such lien instruments together
8 with the fee prescribed for notation of lien, shall notify the first
9 lienholder to deliver to the county treasurer or department, within
10 fifteen days after the date of notice, the certificate of title to permit
11 notation of such other lien. After such notation of lien, the lien shall
12 become part of the electronic certificate of title record created by the
13 county treasurer or department which is maintained on the electronic
14 title and lien system. The holder of a certificate of title who refuses
15 to deliver a certificate of title to the county treasurer or department
16 for the purpose of noting such other lien on such certificate of title
17 within fifteen days after the date when notified to do so shall be liable
18 for damages to such other lienholder for the amount of damages such other
19 lienholder suffered by reason of the holder of the certificate of title
20 refusing to permit the noting of such lien on the certificate of title.
21 (8) When a lien is discharged, the holder shall, within fifteen days
22 after payment is received, note a cancellation of the lien on the
23 certificate of title over his, her, or its signature and deliver the
24 certificate of title to the county treasurer or the department, which
25 shall note the cancellation of the lien on the face of the certificate of
26 title and on the records of such office. If delivered to a county
27 treasurer, he or she shall on that day notify the department which shall
28 note the cancellation on its records. The county treasurer or the
29 department shall then return the certificate of title to the owner or as
30 otherwise directed by the owner. The cancellation of lien shall be noted
31 on the certificate of title without charge. For an electronic certificate
-8-

LB490 LB490
2025 2025
1 of title record, the lienholder shall, within fifteen days after payment
2 is received when such lien is discharged, notify the department
3 electronically or provide written notice of such lien release, in a
4 manner prescribed by the department, to the county treasurer or
5 department. The department shall note the cancellation of lien and, if no
6 other liens exist, issue the certificate of title to the owner or as
7 otherwise directed by the owner or lienholder. If the holder of the title
8 cannot locate a lienholder, a lien may be discharged ten years after the
9 date of filing by presenting proof that thirty days have passed since the
10 mailing of a written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested,
11 to the last-known address of the lienholder.
12 Sec. 5. Section 60-166, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
13 amended to read:

15 date designated by the Director of Motor Vehicles pursuant to subsection
