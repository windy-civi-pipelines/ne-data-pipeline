1 director pursuant to subsection (7) of section 60-1507, a licensed
2 dealer, may file a lien electronically as prescribed by the department.
3 Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of title for a vehicle,
4 any lien filed electronically shall become part of the electronic
5 certificate of title record created by the county treasurer or department
6 maintained on the electronic title and lien system. If an application for
7 a certificate of title indicates that there is a lien or encumbrance on a
8 vehicle or if a lien or notice of lien has been filed electronically, the
9 department shall retain an electronic certificate of title record and
10 shall note and cancel such liens electronically on the system. The
11 department shall provide access to the electronic certificate of title
12 records for licensed dealers and lienholders who participate in the
13 system by a method determined by the director.
14 (2) Except as provided in section 60-165 or section 6 of this act,

17 other record whatsoever of a security agreement, conveyance intended to
18 operate as a mortgage, trust receipt, conditional sales contract, or
19 similar instrument or any copy of the same covering a vehicle. Any
20 mortgage, conveyance intended to operate as a security agreement as
21 provided by article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, trust receipt,
22 conditional sales contract, or other similar instrument covering a
23 vehicle, if such instrument is accompanied by delivery of such
24 manufacturer's or importer's certificate and followed by actual and
25 continued possession of the same by the holder of such instrument or, in
26 the case of a certificate of title, if a notation of the same has been
27 made electronically as prescribed in subsection (1) of this section or by
28 the county treasurer or department on the face of the certificate of
29 title or on the electronic certificate of title record, shall be valid as
30 against the creditors of the debtor, whether armed with process or not,
31 and subsequent purchasers, secured parties, and other lienholders or

1 claimants but otherwise shall not be valid against them, except that
2 during any period in which a vehicle is inventory, as defined in section
3 9-102, Uniform Commercial Code, held for sale by a person or corporation
4 that is required to be licensed as provided in the Motor Vehicle Industry
5 Regulation Act and is in the business of selling such vehicles, the
6 filing provisions of article 9, Uniform Commercial Code, as applied to
7 inventory, shall apply to a security interest in such vehicle created by
8 such person or corporation as debtor without the notation of lien on the
9 certificate of title. A buyer of a vehicle at retail from a dealer
10 required to be licensed as provided in the Motor Vehicle Industry
11 Regulation Act shall take such vehicle free of any security interest. A
12 purchase-money security interest, as defined in section 9-103, Uniform
13 Commercial Code, in a vehicle is perfected against the rights of judicial
14 lien creditors and execution creditors on and after the date the
15 purchase-money security interest attaches.
16 (3) Subject to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, all liens,
17 security agreements, and encumbrances noted upon a certificate of title
18 or an electronic certificate of title record and all liens noted
19 electronically as prescribed in subsection (1) of this section shall take
20 priority according to the order of time in which the same are noted by
21 the county treasurer or department. Exposure for sale of any vehicle by
22 the owner thereof with the knowledge or with the knowledge and consent of
23 the holder of any lien, security agreement, or encumbrance on such
24 vehicle shall not render the same void or ineffective as against the
25 creditors of such owner or holder of subsequent liens, security
26 agreements, or encumbrances upon such vehicle.
27 (4) The holder of a security agreement, trust receipt, conditional
28 sales contract, or similar instrument, upon presentation of such
29 instrument to the department or to any county treasurer, together with
30 the certificate of title and the fee prescribed for notation of lien, may
31 have a notation of such lien made on the face of such certificate of
-5-

LB490 LB490
MJP - 02/11/2025 MJP - 02/11/2025
1 title. The owner of a vehicle may present a valid out-of-state
2 certificate of title issued to such owner for such vehicle with a
3 notation of lien on such certificate of title and the prescribed fee to
4 the county treasurer or department and have the notation of lien made on
5 the new certificate of title issued pursuant to section 60-144 without
6 presenting a copy of the lien instrument. The county treasurer or the
7 department shall enter the notation and the date thereof over the
8 signature of the person making the notation and the seal of the office.
9 If noted by a county treasurer, he or she shall on that day notify the
10 department which shall note the lien on its records. The county treasurer
11 or the department shall also indicate by appropriate notation and on such
12 instrument itself the fact that such lien has been noted on the
13 certificate of title.
14 (5) A transaction does not create a sale or a security interest in a
15 vehicle, other than an all-terrain vehicle, a utility-type vehicle, or a
16 minibike, merely because it provides that the rental price is permitted
17 or required to be adjusted under the agreement either upward or downward
18 by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the
19 vehicle.
20 (6) The county treasurer or the department, upon receipt of a lien
21 instrument duly signed by the owner in the manner prescribed by law
22 governing such lien instruments together with the fee prescribed for
23 notation of lien, shall notify the first lienholder to deliver to the
24 county treasurer or the department, within fifteen days after the date of
25 notice, the certificate of title to permit notation of such other lien
26 and, after notation of such other lien, the county treasurer or the
27 department shall deliver the certificate of title to the first
28 lienholder. The holder of a certificate of title who refuses to deliver a
29 certificate of title to the county treasurer or the department for the
30 purpose of showing such other lien on such certificate of title within
31 fifteen days after the date of notice shall be liable for damages to such
-6-

MJP - 02/11/2025 MJP - 02/11/2025
1 other lienholder for the amount of damages such other lienholder suffered
2 by reason of the holder of the certificate of title refusing to permit
3 the showing of such lien on the certificate of title.
4 (7) Upon receipt of a subsequent lien instrument duly signed by the
5 owner in the manner prescribed by law governing such lien instruments or
6 a notice of lien filed electronically, together with an application for
7 notation of the subsequent lien, the fee prescribed in section 60-154,
8 and, if a printed certificate of title exists, the presentation of the
9 certificate of title, the county treasurer or department shall make
10 notation of such other lien. If the certificate of title is not an
11 electronic certificate of title record, the county treasurer or
12 department, upon receipt of a lien instrument duly signed by the owner in
13 the manner prescribed by law governing such lien instruments together
14 with the fee prescribed for notation of lien, shall notify the first
15 lienholder to deliver to the county treasurer or department, within
16 fifteen days after the date of notice, the certificate of title to permit
17 notation of such other lien. After such notation of lien, the lien shall
18 become part of the electronic certificate of title record created by the
19 county treasurer or department which is maintained on the electronic
20 title and lien system. The holder of a certificate of title who refuses
21 to deliver a certificate of title to the county treasurer or department
22 for the purpose of noting such other lien on such certificate of title
23 within fifteen days after the date when notified to do so shall be liable
24 for damages to such other lienholder for the amount of damages such other
25 lienholder suffered by reason of the holder of the certificate of title
26 refusing to permit the noting of such lien on the certificate of title.
27 (8) When a lien is discharged, the holder shall, within fifteen days
28 after payment is received, note a cancellation of the lien on the
29 certificate of title over his, her, or its signature and deliver the
30 certificate of title to the county treasurer or the department, which
31 shall note the cancellation of the lien on the face of the certificate of
-7-

1 title and on the records of such office. If delivered to a county
2 treasurer, he or she shall on that day notify the department which shall
3 note the cancellation on its records. The county treasurer or the
4 department shall then return the certificate of title to the owner or as
5 otherwise directed by the owner. The cancellation of lien shall be noted
6 on the certificate of title without charge. For an electronic certificate
7 of title record, the lienholder shall, within fifteen days after payment
8 is received when such lien is discharged, notify the department
9 electronically or provide written notice of such lien release, in a
10 manner prescribed by the department, to the county treasurer or
11 department. The department shall note the cancellation of lien and, if no
12 other liens exist, issue the certificate of title to the owner or as
13 otherwise directed by the owner or lienholder. If the holder of the title
14 cannot locate a lienholder, a lien may be discharged ten years after the
15 date of filing by presenting proof that thirty days have passed since the
16 mailing of a written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested,
17 to the last-known address of the lienholder.
18 Sec. 5. Section 60-166, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:

21 date designated by the Director of Motor Vehicles pursuant to subsection
