2 amended to read:
3 81-3720 (1)(a) The County Visitors Improvement Fund shall be
4 administered by the governing body of the county with the advice of the
5 visitors committee created pursuant to section 81-3717. The fund shall be
6 used to make grants for expanding and improving facilities at any
7 existing visitor attraction, acquiring or expanding exhibits for existing
8 visitor attractions, constructing visitor attractions, or planning or
9 developing such expansions, improvements, or construction.
10 (b) Grants shall be available for any visitor attraction in the

16 thousand dollars. Grants may be made for a term of years not to exceed
17 twenty years and may be pledged by the recipient to secure bonds issued
18 to finance expansion, improvement, or construction of a visitor
19 attraction. Any grant made for a term of years shall be funded each year
20 in accordance with any agreement contained in the grant contract.

24 the tax but shall be payable solely from grant funds. Each bond issued by
25 any grant recipient which pledges grant funds shall contain on the face
26 thereof a statement that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing
27 power of the county levying the tax is pledged to the payment of the
