1 Section 1. Section 28-325, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 28-325 The Legislature hereby finds and declares:
4 (1) That the following provisions were motivated by the legislative
5 intrusion of the United States Supreme Court by virtue of its decision
6 removing the protection afforded the unborn. Sections 28-325 to 28-345
7 are in no way to be construed as legislatively encouraging abortions at
8 any stage of unborn human development, but are rather an expression of
9 the will of the people of the State of Nebraska and the members of the
10 Legislature to provide protection for the life of the unborn child
11 whenever possible;
12 (2) That the members of the Legislature expressly deplore the
13 destruction of the unborn human lives which has and will occur in
14 Nebraska as a consequence of the United States Supreme Court's decision
15 on abortion of January 22, 1973;
16 (3) That it is in the interest of the people of the State of
17 Nebraska that every precaution be taken to insure the protection of every
18 viable unborn child being aborted, and every precaution be taken to
19 provide life-supportive procedures to insure the unborn child its
20 continued life after its abortion;
21 (4) That currently this state is prevented from providing adequate
22 legal remedies to protect the life, health, and welfare of pregnant women
23 and unborn human life;
24 (4) (5) That it is in the interest of the people of the State of
25 Nebraska to maintain accurate statistical data to aid in providing proper
26 maternal health regulations and education;
27 (5) (6) That the existing standard of care for preabortion screening
28 and counseling is not always adequate to protect the health needs of
29 women;
30 (6) (7) That clarifying the minimum standard of care for preabortion
31 screening and counseling in statute is a practical means of protecting
-2-

LB669 LB669
2025 2025
1 the well-being of women and may better ensure that abortion doctors are
2 sufficiently aware of each patient's risk profile so they may give each
3 patient a well-informed medical opinion regarding her unique case; and
4 (7) (8) That providing right to redress against nonphysicians who
5 perform illegal abortions or encourage self-abortions is an important
6 means of protecting women's health; and .
7 (8) That abundant research indicates many pregnant women feel
8 coerced or pressured into abortion, and that it is in the interest of the
9 people and the State of Nebraska that these women be given an opportunity
10 to report coercion, abuse, and human trafficking.
11 Sec. 2. Section 28-326, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
12 2024, is amended to read:

20 and which causes the premature termination of the pregnancy;
21 (2) Complications associated with abortion means any adverse
22 physical, psychological, or emotional reaction that is reported in a

LB669 LB669
2025 2025
1 voluntary and informed only if:
2 (1) The woman is told the following by the physician who is to
3 perform the abortion, by the referring physician, or by a physician
4 assistant or registered nurse licensed under the Uniform Credentialing
5 Act who is an agent of either physician, at least twenty-four hours
6 before the abortion:

10 pregnancies, and infertility;
11 (b) The probable gestational age of the unborn child at the time the
12 abortion is to be performed;
13 (c) The medical risks associated with carrying her child to term;

21 immediate medical assistance is available on the website of the
22 Department of Health and Human Services.

30 may provide this information by telephone without conducting a physical
31 examination or tests of the patient, in which case the information
-6-

LB669 LB669
2025 2025
1 required to be supplied may be based on facts supplied by the patient and
2 whatever other relevant information is reasonably available to the
3 physician or the physician's agent;
4 (2) The woman is informed by telephone or in person, by the
5 physician who is to perform the abortion, by the referring physician, or
6 by an agent of either physician, at least twenty-four hours before the
7 abortion:
8 (a) The name of the physician who will perform the abortion;
9 (b) That medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal
10 care, childbirth, and neonatal care;
11 (c) That the father is liable to assist in the support of her child,
12 even in instances in which the father has offered to pay for the

15 in section 28-327.01. The physician or his or her agent shall orally
16 inform the woman that the materials have been provided by the Department
17 of Health and Human Services and that they describe the unborn child,
18 list agencies which offer alternatives to abortion, and include
19 information on finding immediate medical assistance if she changes her
20 mind after taking mifepristone and wants to continue her pregnancy. If
21 the woman chooses to review the materials, they shall either be given to
22 her at least twenty-four hours before the abortion or mailed to her at
23 least seventy-two hours before the abortion by certified mail, restricted
24 delivery to addressee, which means the postal employee can only deliver
25 the mail to the addressee. The physician and his or her agent may
26 disassociate themselves from the materials and may comment or refrain
27 from commenting on them as they choose; and
28 (e) That she has the right to request a comprehensive list, compiled
29 by the Department of Health and Human Services, of health care providers,
30 facilities, and clinics that offer to have ultrasounds performed by a
31 person at least as qualified as a registered nurse licensed under the
-7-

LB669 LB669

3 geographically and shall include the name, address, hours of operation,
4 and telephone number of each entity. If requested by the woman, the
5 physician who is to perform the abortion, the referring physician, or his
6 or her agent shall provide such a list as compiled by the department; and
7 (f) The telephone numbers for the national domestic violence hotline
8 and the national human trafficking hotline.
9 (3) If an ultrasound is used prior to the performance of an
10 abortion, the physician who is to perform the abortion, the referring
11 physician, or a physician assistant or registered nurse licensed under
12 the Uniform Credentialing Act who is an agent of either physician, or any
13 qualified agent of either physician, shall:
14 (a) Perform an ultrasound of the woman's unborn child of a quality
15 consistent with standard medical practice in the community at least one
16 hour prior to the performance of the abortion;
17 (b) Simultaneously display the ultrasound images so that the woman
18 may choose to view the ultrasound images or not view the ultrasound
19 images. The woman shall be informed that the ultrasound images will be
20 displayed so that she is able to view them. Nothing in this subdivision
21 shall be construed to require the woman to view the displayed ultrasound
22 images; and
23 (c) If the woman requests information about the displayed ultrasound
24 image, her questions shall be answered. If she requests a detailed,
25 simultaneous, medical description of the ultrasound image, one shall be

27 of cardiac activity, if present and viewable, and the presence of
28 external members and internal organs, if present and viewable;
29 (4) At least one hour prior to the performance of an abortion, a

4 hotline and the opportunity to make a confidential telephone call
5 informed of the risk factors associated with abortion as discussed; and
6 (f) (d) Retained a copy of the written evaluation results in the
7 pregnant woman's permanent record;
8 (5) If any risk factors associated with abortion were identified,

11 undergoing an elective medical procedure:
12 (a) Each complication associated with each identified risk factor;
13 and
14 (b) Any quantifiable risk rates whenever such relevant data exists;
15 (6) The physician performing the abortion has formed a reasonable
16 medical judgment, documented in the permanent record, that:
17 (a) The preponderance of statistically validated medical studies
18 demonstrates that the physical, psychological, and familial risks
19 associated with abortion for patients with risk factors similar to the
20 patient's risk factors are negligible risks;

8 certification form in the woman's medical record.
9 Sec. 4. Section 28-327.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 28-327.03 No civil liability for failure to comply with subdivision
12 (2)(d) of section 28-327 or that portion of subdivision (5) (7) of such
13 section requiring a written certification that the woman has been
14 informed of her right to review the information referred to in
15 subdivision (2)(d) of such section may be imposed unless the Department

20 amended to read:
21 28-327.04 Any person upon whom an abortion has been performed or

24 of such section shall have a right to maintain a civil cause of action

26 abortion. A violation of subdivision (1), (2), (3), (5), or (6) (7), or
27 (8) of section 28-327 shall be prima facie evidence of professional
28 negligence. The written certifications prescribed by subdivisions (4) and
29 (5) (7) of section 28-327 signed by the person upon whom an abortion has
30 been performed or attempted shall constitute and create a rebuttable
31 presumption of full compliance with all provisions of section 28-327 in
-11-

LB669 LB669

1 favor of the physician who performed or attempted to perform the
2 abortion, the referring physician, or the agent of either physician. The

9 amended to read:
10 28-327.06 Any waiver of the evaluations, and notices, and
11 requirements provided for in subdivision (4) of section 28-327 is void
12 and unenforceable.
13 Sec. 7. Section 28-327.11, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 28-327.11 In a civil action involving section 28-327, the following
16 shall apply:
17 (1) In determining the liability of the physician and the validity
18 of the consent of a pregnant woman, the failure to comply with the
19 requirements of section 28-327 shall create a rebuttable presumption that
20 the pregnant woman would not have undergone the recommended abortion had
21 section 28-327 been complied with by the physician;
22 (2) The absence of physical injury shall not preclude an award of
23 noneconomic damages including pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental
24 suffering, emotional distress, psychological trauma, loss of society or
25 companionship, loss of consortium, injury to reputation, or humiliation
26 associated with the abortion;
27 (3) The fact that a physician does not perform elective abortions or
28 has not performed elective abortions in the past shall not automatically
29 disqualify such physician from being an expert witness. A licensed
30 obstetrician or family practitioner who regularly assists pregnant women
31 in resolving medical matters related to pregnancy may be qualified to

1 testify as an expert on the screening, counseling, management, and
2 treatment of pregnancies; and
3 (4) Any physician advertising services in this state shall be deemed
4 to be transacting business in this state pursuant to section 25-536 and
5 shall be subject to the provisions of section 28-327;
6 (5) It shall be an affirmative defense to an allegation of
7 inadequate disclosure under the requirements of section 28-327 that the
8 defendant omitted the contested information because statistically
9 validated surveys of the general population of women of reproductive age,
10 conducted within the three years before or after the contested abortion,
11 demonstrate that less than five percent of women would consider the
12 contested information to be relevant to an abortion decision; and
13 (4) (6) In addition to the other remedies available under the common
14 or statutory law of this state, a woman or her survivors shall have a
15 cause of action for reckless endangerment against any person, other than
16 a physician or pharmacist licensed under the Uniform Credentialing Act,
17 who attempts or completes an abortion on the pregnant woman or aids or
18 abets the commission of a self-induced abortion. Proof of injury shall
19 not be required to recover an award, including reasonable costs and
20 attorney's fees, for wrongful death under this subdivision.
21 Sec. 8. Section 28-327.12, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 28-327.12 (1) In the event that any portion of section 28-327 is
24 enjoined and subsequently upheld, the statute of limitations for filing a
25 civil suit under section 28-327 shall be tolled during the period for
26 which the injunction is pending and for two years thereafter.
27 (2) Nothing in section 28-327 shall be construed as defining a
28 standard of care for any medical procedure other than an induced
29 abortion.

7 medicine and surgery or the ethics of the profession, regardless of
8 whether a person, patient, or entity is injured, or conduct that is
9 likely to deceive or defraud the public or is detrimental to the public
10 interest, including, but not limited to:
11 (1) Performance by a physician of an abortion as defined in
12 subdivision (1) of section 28-326 under circumstances when he or she will
