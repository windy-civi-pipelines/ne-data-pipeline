-6-

LB510 LB510
2025 2025
1 Proof of such formal action may include resolutions, meeting minutes, or
2 other official measures adopted or taken. Such hearing must be held at
3 least ninety days after delivering written notice via certified mail to
4 the owners of record for the affected real estate proposed to be removed
5 from the good life district. The hearing must be open to the public and
6 for the stated purpose of hearing testimony regarding the proposed
7 removal of property from the good life district. Attendees must be given
8 the opportunity to speak and submit documentary evidence at, prior to, or
9 contemporaneously with such hearing for the department to consider in
10 making its findings.
11 (8) After establishment of a good life district pursuant to this

13 application or after any modification is made to the boundaries of a good
14 life district pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, a city or

16 may file a supplemental request to the department to increase the size of

20 separate parcels and such parcels shall be (a) adjacent to the existing
21 good life district or (b) if not adjacent to the existing good life
22 district, within or adjacent to the existing corporate limits of the

25 that such increase would not negatively impact the criteria that were
26 necessary for the original establishment of such good life district. Such
27 request and accompanying materials shall be subject to the same
28 confidentiality restrictions as provided in subsection (3) of section
29 77-4404 for applications submitted pursuant to such section.
30 (9) After establishment of a good life district pursuant to this

-7-

LB510 LB510
2025 2025
1 life district pursuant to this section, the department shall transmit to
2 any city or village which includes such good life district within its
3 boundaries or within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction (a) all
4 information held by the department related to the application and
5 approval of the application, (b) all documentation which describes the
6 property included within the good life district, and (c) all
7 documentation transmitted to the applicant for such good life district
8 with approval of the application and establishment of the good life

17 village which includes such good life district within its boundaries or
18 within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction, the good life district
19 applicant may apply to the department to establish development and design
20 standards for the good life district. Such standards may include, but are

23 owners to utilize specific contractors, professionals, suppliers, or

25 a hearing after one hundred eighty days' notice to all property owners in

27 comprehensive and cohesive character and aesthetic for development in the
28 good life district, and that the standards will further the purposes of
29 the Good Life Transformational Projects Act. The development and design
30 standards must be commercially reasonable and consistent with terminology
31 and accepted practices in the architecture industry, must not conflict
-8-

1 with any building code or other similar law or regulation, and must not
2 impose an undue burden on property owners in the district. If approved,
3 the standards shall apply to all new construction inside of the good life
4 district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such standards established
5 by the department shall be in addition and supplemental to any local
6 zoning, building code, comprehensive plan, or similar requirements of the
7 city or village, which requirements of the city or village shall control
8 to the extent of any conflict with any design standards established by
9 the department.
10 (11) Demonstration of meeting the required new development costs for
11 purposes of subdivision (2)(a) of this section may be established by
12 evidence submitted by the good life district applicant, the city or
13 village where the good life district is located, or any other person
14 which submits satisfactory evidence to the department.

28 (2) The department shall measure the amount of commitments for such
29 investment from evidence submitted by the good life district applicant,

31 or any other source. The department shall accept evidence from other
-9-

LB510 LB510
2025 2025
1 sources so long as the expenditure evidence submitted is related to any
2 portion of the project described in the application as amended or
3 supplemented. All evidence shall be certified by the good life district
4 applicant or such city or village in which all or a portion of the
5 district is located stating that the evidence submitted represents
6 commitments for investment in the project described in the application.
7 All such evidence of commitments for investment shall be accepted by the
8 department and counted toward the applicable threshold. Within thirty
9 days after the end of each calendar quarter, the department shall provide
10 a summary of the total commitments for investment received by the
11 department and counted toward the investment threshold required under
12 subdivision (2)(a) of section 77-4405 to the good life district applicant
13 and to the city or village in which all or a portion of the district is
14 located until the investment threshold required under subdivision (2)(a)
15 of section 77-4405 has been met for the applicable good life district.
16 determined appropriate by the department.
17 (3) Prior to terminating a good life district as provided in this

19 owners within the approved good life district and the city or village
20 which includes such good life district within its boundaries or within
21 its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction that the department intends to
22 terminate such district. Such property owners, city or village shall have
23 ninety days after receipt of such written notice from the department to
24 assume the statutory role and responsibilities of the applicable good
25 life district applicant. If a property owner or owners or the city or
26 village assumes such role and responsibilities, the measurement
27 thresholds provided in subsection (1) of this section shall each be
28 extended by two hundred and seventy-five days or two hundred and seventy-
29 five days beyond the date of such assumption of role and
30 responsibilities, whichever is later. Upon a property owner or owners or
31 the city or village assuming the role and responsibilities of the good
