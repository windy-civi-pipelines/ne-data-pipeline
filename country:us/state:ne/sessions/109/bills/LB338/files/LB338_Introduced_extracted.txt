1 Section 1. The Legislature hereby finds that:
2 (1) Recent advances in genetic science have led to improvements in
3 the diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of a significant number of
4 human diseases;
5 (2) Genetic testing can help individuals take steps to avoid disease
6 entirely or identify disease earlier, maximizing an individual's health
7 and lifespan and reducing health care costs for patients, families, and
8 communities in the long term;
9 (3) Concerns about ability to access insurance create a disincentive
10 from seeking genetic testing for some individuals, preventing the full
11 realization of opportunity for genetic testing;
12 (4) The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, 29 U.S.C.
13 1182, prohibits genetic information from being used as a condition of
14 eligibility, to set premium rates, or impose preexisting condition
15 exclusions for health insurance;
16 (5) The intent of section 2 of this act is to reduce barriers to the
17 benefits of genetic testing by protecting genetic information from being
18 used to impact access to life insurance, group disability insurance, or
19 long-term care insurance coverage.
20 Sec. 2. (1) In the absence of clinical diagnosis of a condition,
21 life insurers, disability insurers, and long-term care insurers shall
22 not:
23 (a) Cancel, limit, or deny coverage, or establish differentials in
24 premium rates based on genetic information collected, used, or stored for
25 health care treatment; or
26 (b) Require or solicit genetic information, use genetic test
27 results, or consider an individual's decision or action relating to
28 genetic testing in any manner or for any purpose related to life
29 insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.
