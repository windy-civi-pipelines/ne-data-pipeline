28 student, approved special education rates, the department's general
29 experience with special education budgets, and the cost per student in
30 the district in which such residential setting is located. Once the

8 including all special education services and support services, with the
9 amount of payment for all educational services determined pursuant to the
10 average per pupil cost of the service agency as defined in section
11 79-1116. The resident school district shall retain responsibility for
12 such student's individualized education plan, if any. The educational

15 setting and the school district in which such residential setting is
16 located, (iii) a contract between the residential setting and another

19 (d) If a school district pays a school district in which a
20 residential setting is located for educational services provided pursuant
21 to subdivision (10)(b) of this section and it is later determined that a
22 different school district was the resident school district for such
23 student at the time such educational services were provided, the school
24 district that was later determined to be the resident school district
25 shall reimburse the school district that initially paid for the
26 educational services one hundred ten percent of the amount paid.
27 (e) A student residing in a residential setting described in this
28 subsection shall be defined as a student with a handicap pursuant to

8 (2) A school board shall admit a student upon request without charge
9 if at least one of the student's parents resides in the school district.
10 (3) A school board shall admit any homeless student upon request
11 without charge if the district is the district in which the student (a)
12 is currently located, (b) attended when permanently housed, or (c) was

14 (4) A school board may allow a student whose residency in the
15 district ceases during a school year to continue attending school in such
16 district for the remainder of that school year.

3 (8) A school board may admit a student who is a resident of another
4 state to the school district and collect tuition in advance at a rate
5 determined by the school board.
6 (9) When a student as a ward of the state or as a ward of any court
7 (a) has been placed in a school district other than the district in which
8 he or she resided at the time he or she became a ward and such ward does
9 not reside in a foster family home licensed or approved by the Department
10 of Health and Human Services or a foster home maintained or used pursuant
11 to section 83-108.04 or (b) has been placed in any institution which
12 maintains a special education program which has been approved by the
13 State Department of Education and such institution is not owned or
14 operated by the district in which he or she resided at the time he or she
15 became a ward, the cost of his or her education and the required
16 transportation costs associated with the student's education shall be
17 paid by the state, but not in advance, to the receiving school district
18 or approved institution under rules and regulations prescribed by the
19 Department of Health and Human Services and the student shall remain a
20 resident of the district in which he or she resided at the time he or she
21 became a ward. Any student who is a ward of the state or a ward of any
22 court who resides in a foster family home licensed or approved by the
23 Department of Health and Human Services or a foster home maintained or
24 used pursuant to section 83-108.04 shall be deemed a resident of the

1 reasons other than to receive an education and the residential setting is
2 operated by a service provider which is certified or licensed by the
3 Department of Health and Human Services or is enrolled in the medical
4 assistance program established pursuant to the Medical Assistance Act and
5 Title XIX or XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, the
6 student shall remain a resident of the district in which he or she
7 resided immediately prior to residing in such residential setting. The
8 resident district for a student who is not a ward of the state or a ward
9 of any court does not change when the student moves from one residential
10 setting to another.
11 (b) If a student is residing in a residential setting as described
12 in subdivision (10)(a) of this section and such residential setting does
13 not maintain an interim-program school as defined in section 79-1119.01
14 or an approved or accredited school, the resident school district shall
15 contract with the district in which such residential setting is located
16 for the provision of all educational services, including all special
17 education services and support services as defined in section 79-1125.01,
18 unless a parent or guardian and the resident school district agree that
19 an appropriate education will be provided by the resident school district
20 while the student is residing in such residential setting. If the
21 resident school district is required to contract, the district in which
22 such residential setting is located shall contract with the resident
23 district and provide all educational services, including all special
24 education services, to the student. If the two districts cannot agree on
25 the amount of the contract, the State Department of Education shall
26 determine the amount to be paid by the resident district to the district
27 in which such residential setting is located based on the needs of the
28 student, approved special education rates, the department's general
29 experience with special education budgets, and the cost per student in
30 the district in which such residential setting is located. Once the
31 contract has been entered into, all legal responsibility for special
-3-

LB306 LB306
LPB - 05/28/2025 LPB - 05/28/2025
1 education and related services shall be transferred to the school
2 district in which the residential setting is located.
3 (c) If a student is residing in a residential setting as described
4 in subdivision (10)(a) of this section and such residential setting
5 maintains an interim-program school as defined in section 79-1119.01 or
6 an approved or accredited school, the department shall reimburse such
7 residential setting for the provision of all educational services,
8 including all special education services and support services, with the
9 amount of payment for all educational services determined pursuant to the
10 average per pupil cost of the service agency as defined in section
11 79-1116. The resident school district shall retain responsibility for
12 such student's individualized education plan, if any. The educational
13 services may be provided through (i) such interim-program school or
14 approved or accredited school, (ii) a contract between the residential
15 setting and the school district in which such residential setting is
16 located, (iii) a contract between the residential setting and another
17 service agency as defined in section 79-1124, or (iv) a combination of
18 such educational service providers.
19 (d) If a school district pays a school district in which a
20 residential setting is located for educational services provided pursuant
21 to subdivision (10)(b) of this section and it is later determined that a
22 different school district was the resident school district for such
23 student at the time such educational services were provided, the school
24 district that was later determined to be the resident school district
25 shall reimburse the school district that initially paid for the
26 educational services one hundred ten percent of the amount paid.
27 (e) A student residing in a residential setting described in this
28 subsection shall be defined as a student with a handicap pursuant to
29 Article VII, section 11, of the Constitution of Nebraska, and as such the
30 state and any political subdivision may contract with institutions not
31 wholly owned or controlled by the state or any political subdivision to

1 provide the educational services to the student if such educational
2 services are nonsectarian in nature.
3 (11) A school board shall admit a student upon request without
4 charge for part-time enrollment for purposes of participating in
5 extracurricular activities in accordance with section 79-2,136 if (a) the
6 student is also enrolled in a private, denominational, or parochial
7 school or in a school which elects pursuant to section 79-1601 not to
8 meet accreditation or approval requirements and (b) either (i) the school
9 district where such student or such student's parent resides does not
10 offer the extracurricular activity in which the student desires to
11 participate and the school district which the student is requesting to
12 attend is the closest school district to the residence of such student or
13 such student's parent that offers such extracurricular activity or (ii)
14 the school district where such student or such student's parent resides
15 does offer the extracurricular activity in which the student desires to
16 participate but the school district the student is requesting to attend
17 includes the closest school to the residence of such student or such
18 student's parent that offers such extracurricular activity.
19 (12) (11) In the case of any individual eighteen years of age or
20 younger who is a ward of the state or any court and who is placed in a
21 county detention home established under section 43-2,110, the cost of his
22 or her education shall be paid by the state, regardless of the district
23 in which he or she resided at the time he or she became a ward, to the
24 agency or institution which: (a) Is selected by the county board with
25 jurisdiction over such detention home; (b) has agreed or contracted with
26 such county board to provide educational services; and (c) has been
27 approved by the State Department of Education pursuant to rules and
28 regulations prescribed by the State Board of Education.
29 (13) (12) No tuition shall be charged for students who may be by law
30 allowed to attend the school without charge.
