13 (d) If a school district pays a school district in which a
14 residential setting is located for educational services provided pursuant
15 to subdivision (10)(b) of this section and it is later determined that a
16 different school district was the resident school district for such
17 student at the time such educational services were provided, the school
18 district that was later determined to be the resident school district
19 shall reimburse the school district that initially paid for the
20 educational services one hundred ten percent of the amount paid.
