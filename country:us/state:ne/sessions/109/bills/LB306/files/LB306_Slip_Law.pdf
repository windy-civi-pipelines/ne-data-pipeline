which such residential setting is located based on the needs of the student,
approved special education rates, the department's general experience with
special education budgets, and the cost per student in the district in which
such residential setting is located. Once the contract has been entered into,
all legal responsibility for special education and related services shall be
transferred to the school district in which the residential setting is located.
(c) If a student is residing in a residential setting as described in
subdivision (10)(a) of this section and such residential setting maintains an
interim-program school as defined in section 79-1119.01 or an approved or
accredited school, the department shall reimburse such residential setting for
the provision of all educational services, including all special education
services and support services, with the amount of payment for all educational
services determined pursuant to the average per pupil cost of the service
agency as defined in section 79-1116. The resident school district shall retain
responsibility for such student's individualized education plan, if any. The
educational services may be provided through (i) such interim-program school or
approved or accredited school, (ii) a contract between the residential setting
and the school district in which such residential setting is located, (iii) a
contract between the residential setting and another service agency as defined

providers.

setting is located for educational services provided pursuant to subdivision

district that initially paid for the educational services one hundred ten
percent of the amount paid.
(e) A student residing in a residential setting described in this
subsection shall be defined as a student with a handicap pursuant to Article

political subdivision may contract with institutions not wholly owned or
controlled by the state or any political subdivision to provide the educational
services to the student if such educational services are nonsectarian in
nature.
(11) A school board shall admit a student upon request without charge for
part-time enrollment for purposes of participating in extracurricular
activities in accordance with section 79-2,136 if (a) the student is also
enrolled in a private, denominational, or parochial school or in a school which

student or such student's parent that offers such extracurricular activity or

does offer the extracurricular activity in which the student desires to
participate but the school district the student is requesting to attend
includes the closest school to the residence of such student or such student's
parent that offers such extracurricular activity.
(12) (11) In the case of any individual eighteen years of age or younger
who is a ward of the state or any court and who is placed in a county detention
home established under section 43-2,110, the cost of his or her education shall
be paid by the state, regardless of the district in which he or she resided at
