16 (b) Synthetic media means an image, an audio recording, or a video
17 recording of an individual's appearance, speech, or conduct that has been

1 satellite television operator, programmer, or producer, when it is paid

5 advertisements from legally qualified candidates;
6 (c) An Internet website, or a regularly published newspaper,
