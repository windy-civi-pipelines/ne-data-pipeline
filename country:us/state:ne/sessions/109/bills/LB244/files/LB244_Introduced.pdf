1 Section 1. Section 49-1402, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 49-1402 The Legislature finds that:
4 (1) The That the public interest in the manner in which election
5 campaigns are conducted has increased greatly in recent years, creating a
6 need for additional accountability and disclosure and accountability;
7 (2) There That there is a compelling state interest in ensuring that
8 the state and local elections are free of corruption and the appearance
9 of corruption and that this can only be achieved if (a) the sources of
10 funding of campaigns are fully disclosed and (b) the use of money in
11 campaigns is fully disclosed;
12 (3) It That it is essential to the proper operation of democratic
13 government that public officials and employees be independent and
14 impartial, that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper
15 channels of governmental structure, and that public office or employment
16 not be used for private gain other than the compensation provided by law;
17 and
18 (4) The That the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired
19 when there exists, or appears to exist, a substantial conflict between
20 the private interests of a public official and his or her duties as such
21 official. Although, ; and that although the vast majority of public
22 officials and employees are dedicated and serve with high integrity, the
23 public interest requires that the law provide greater accountability,
24 disclosure, and guidance with respect to the conduct of public officials
25 and employees.
26 Sec. 2. Original section 49-1402, Reissue Revised Statutes of
27 Nebraska, is repealed.
