2 a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a
3 public official due to a public health emergency; or an employee's need
4 to self-isolate or care for the employee or a family member when it has
5 been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a
6 health care professional that the employee's or family member's presence
7 in the community may jeopardize the health of others because of exposure
8 to a communicable disease, whether or not the employee or family member
9 has actually contracted the communicable disease.
10 (2) Paid sick time under this section shall be provided upon the

13 expected duration of the absence.
14 (3) An employer that requires notice of the need to use paid sick
15 time in accordance with this section shall provide a written policy that
16 contains reasonable procedures for employees to provide notice. An
17 employer that has not provided to the employee a copy of such written
18 policy shall not deny paid sick time to the employee based on
19 noncompliance with such a policy.
20 (4) An employer shall not require, as a condition of an employee's
21 taking paid sick time under this section, that the employee search for or
22 find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is
23 using paid sick time.
24 (5) Paid sick time under this section may be used in the smaller of
25 hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll
26 system uses to account for absences or use of other time.
27 (6) For use of paid sick time for more than three consecutive work
28 days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the paid sick
29 time has been used for a purpose covered by subsection (1) of this
30 section. Reasonable documentation shall include (a) documentation signed

-7-

LB415 LB415

2 services from a health care professional, or if documentation cannot be
3 obtained from a health care professional in reasonable time or without
4 added expense, a written statement from the employee indicating that the
5 employee is taking or took paid sick time for a qualifying purpose
6 covered by subsection (1) of this section.
7 (7) An employer signatory to a multi-employer collective-bargaining
8 agreement may fulfill its obligations under the Nebraska Healthy Families
9 and Workplaces Act by making contributions to a multi-employer paid sick
10 time fund, plan, or program based on the hours each employee accrues
11 pursuant to the act while working under the multi-employer collective-
12 bargaining agreement, if the fund, plan, or program enables employees to
13 collect paid sick time from the fund, plan, or program based on hours
14 they have worked under the multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement
15 and for the purposes specified under the act. Employees who work under a
16 multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement into which their employers
17 make contributions as provided in this subsection may collect from the
18 paid sick time fund, plan, or program based on hours they have worked
19 under the multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement and for the
20 purposes specified under the act.
21 Sec. 4. Section 8, Initiative Law 2024, No. 436, is amended to
22 read:
23 Sec. 8. (1) The Commissioner of Labor shall issue a citation to an
24 employer when an investigation reveals that the employer may have
25 violated the Nebraska Healthy Families and Workplaces Act.
26 (2) When a citation is issued, the commissioner shall notify the
27 employer of the proposed administrative penalty, if any, by certified
28 mail, by any other manner of delivery by which the United States Postal
29 Service can verify delivery, or by any method of service recognized under
30 Chapter 25, article 5. The administrative penalty shall not be more than
31 five hundred dollars in the case of a first violation and not more than
-8-

LB415 LB415
2025 2025
1 five thousand dollars in the case of a second or subsequent violation.
2 (3) The employer has fifteen working days after the date of the
3 citation or penalty to contest such citation or penalty. Notice of
4 contest shall be sent to the commissioner who shall provide a hearing in
5 accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
6 (4) Any employer who has an unpaid citation for a violation of the
7 Nebraska Healthy Families and Workplaces Act shall be barred from
8 contracting with the state or any political subdivision until such

11 citation under this subsection until after such contest has been
12 resolved.
13 (5) Citations issued under this section and the names of employers
14 who have been issued a citation shall be made available to the public
15 upon request, except that this subsection shall not apply to any
16 citations that are being contested as described in subsection (3) of this
17 section.
18 (6) An employee having a claim for a violation of the Nebraska
19 Healthy Families and Workplaces Act may institute suit for legal and
20 equitable relief in the proper court. In any action brought to enforce
21 the Nebraska Healthy Families and Workplaces Act, the court shall have
22 jurisdiction to grant such legal or equitable relief as the court deems
23 appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the act. If an employee
24 establishes a claim and secures judgment on the claim, such employee
25 shall also be entitled to recover the full amount of the judgment and all
26 costs of such suit, including reasonable attorney's fees.
27 (7) If an employee institutes suit against an employer under
28 subsection (6) of this section, any citation that is issued against an
29 employer under subsection (1) of this section and that relates directly
30 to the facts in dispute shall be admitted into evidence unless
31 specifically excluded by the court. If a citation has been contested as
-9-

15 enclosure at which such authorized gaming operator license shall be
16 granted.

28 gaming operator conducts games of chance does not hold the minimum number
29 of live racing meets required under section 2-1205, the authorized gaming
30 operator shall be required to cease operating games of chance at such
31 licensed racetrack enclosure until such time as the commission determines
