4 hours in each workweek for purposes of paid sick time accrual unless
5 their typical workweek is less than forty hours, in which case paid sick

7 (3) Paid sick time requirements provided under the Nebraska Healthy
8 Families and Workplaces Act as provided in this section shall begin to
9 accrue at the commencement of employment or October 1, 2025 , whichever

MLU - 03/07/2025 MLU - 03/07/2025
1 Families and Workplaces Act and that may be used for the same purposes
2 and under the same conditions as paid sick time in accordance with
3 section 3 of this act under the act is not required to provide additional
4 paid sick time under the act and is not obligated to allow an employee to
5 accrue or carryover benefits beyond the employer's existing paid leave
6 policy.
7 (8) (6) At its discretion, an employer may loan paid sick time to an
8 employee in advance of accrual by such employee.

1 diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or
2 health condition; care of a family member who needs preventive medical

5 school or place where the child is receiving care; or
6 (c) Closure of the employee's place of business by order of a public
7 official due to a public health emergency; an employee's need to care for
8 a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a

11 been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a
12 health care professional that the employee's or family member's presence
13 in the community may jeopardize the health of others because of exposure
14 to a communicable disease, whether or not the employee or family member
15 has actually contracted the communicable disease.
16 (2) Paid sick time under this section shall be provided upon the
17 oral request of an employee in compliance with the Nebraska Healthy
18 Families and Workplaces Act. When possible, the request shall include the
19 expected duration of the absence.
20 (3) An employer that requires notice of the need to use paid sick
21 time in accordance with this section shall provide a written policy that
22 contains reasonable procedures for employees to provide notice. An
23 employer that has not provided to the employee a copy of such written
24 policy shall not deny paid sick time to the employee based on
25 noncompliance with such a policy.
26 (4) An employer shall not require, as a condition of an employee's
27 taking paid sick time under this section, that the employee search for or
28 find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is
29 using paid sick time.
30 (5) Paid sick time under this section may be used in the smaller of
31 hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll

1 system uses to account for absences or use of other time.
2 (6) For use of paid sick time for more than three consecutive work
3 days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the paid sick
4 time has been used for a purpose covered by subsection (1) of this
5 section. Reasonable documentation shall include (a) documentation signed
6 by a health care professional indicating that paid sick time is or was
7 necessary or (b) if the employee or a family member did not receive
8 services from a health care professional, or if documentation cannot be
9 obtained from a health care professional in reasonable time or without
10 added expense, a written statement from the employee indicating that the
11 employee is taking or took paid sick time for a qualifying purpose
12 covered by subsection (1) of this section.
13 (7) An employer signatory to a multi-employer collective-bargaining
14 agreement may fulfill its obligations under the Nebraska Healthy Families
15 and Workplaces Act by making contributions to a multi-employer paid sick
