14 off policy, who makes available an amount of paid leave that equals or

29 to a communicable disease, whether or not the employee or family member
30 has actually contracted the communicable disease.
31 (2) Paid sick time under this section shall be provided upon the
-6-

2 Families and Workplaces Act. When possible, the request shall include the
3 expected duration of the absence.
4 (3) An employer that requires notice of the need to use paid sick
5 time in accordance with this section shall provide a written policy that
6 contains reasonable procedures for employees to provide notice. An
7 employer that has not provided to the employee a copy of such written
8 policy shall not deny paid sick time to the employee based on
9 noncompliance with such a policy.
10 (4) An employer shall not require, as a condition of an employee's
11 taking paid sick time under this section, that the employee search for or
12 find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is
13 using paid sick time.
14 (5) Paid sick time under this section may be used in the smaller of
15 hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll
16 system uses to account for absences or use of other time.
17 (6) For use of paid sick time for more than three consecutive work
18 days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the paid sick
19 time has been used for a purpose covered by subsection (1) of this
20 section. Reasonable documentation shall include (a) documentation signed
21 by a health care professional indicating that paid sick time is or was
22 necessary or (b) if the employee or a family member did not receive
23 services from a health care professional, or if documentation cannot be
24 obtained from a health care professional in reasonable time or without
25 added expense, a written statement from the employee indicating that the
26 employee is taking or took paid sick time for a qualifying purpose
27 covered by subsection (1) of this section.
28 (7) An employer signatory to a multi-employer collective-bargaining
29 agreement may fulfill its obligations under the Nebraska Healthy Families
30 and Workplaces Act by making contributions to a multi-employer paid sick
31 time fund, plan, or program based on the hours each employee accrues
-7-
LB415 LB415
2025 2025
1 pursuant to the act while working under the multi-employer collective-
2 bargaining agreement, if the fund, plan, or program enables employees to
3 collect paid sick time from the fund, plan, or program based on hours
4 they have worked under the multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement
5 and for the purposes specified under the act. Employees who work under a
6 multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement into which their employers
7 make contributions as provided in this subsection may collect from the

9 under the multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement and for the
10 purposes specified under the act.
11 Sec. 4. Original sections 2, 3, and 4, Initiative Law 2024, No. 436,

6 contains reasonable procedures for employees to provide notice. An
7 employer that has not provided to the employee a copy of such written
8 policy shall not deny paid sick time to the employee based on
9 noncompliance with such a policy.
10 (4) An employer shall not require, as a condition of an employee's
11 taking paid sick time under this section, that the employee search for or
12 find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is
13 using paid sick time.
14 (5) Paid sick time under this section may be used in the smaller of
15 hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll
16 system uses to account for absences or use of other time.
17 (6) For use of paid sick time for more than three consecutive work
18 days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the paid sick
19 time has been used for a purpose covered by subsection (1) of this
20 section. Reasonable documentation shall include (a) documentation signed
21 by a health care professional indicating that paid sick time is or was
22 necessary or (b) if the employee or a family member did not receive
23 services from a health care professional, or if documentation cannot be
24 obtained from a health care professional in reasonable time or without
25 added expense, a written statement from the employee indicating that the
26 employee is taking or took paid sick time for a qualifying purpose
27 covered by subsection (1) of this section.
28 (7) An employer signatory to a multi-employer collective-bargaining
29 agreement may fulfill its obligations under the Nebraska Healthy Families
30 and Workplaces Act by making contributions to a multi-employer paid sick
31 time fund, plan, or program based on the hours each employee accrues
