business; or
(b) Fifty-six hours of paid sick time in a year for an employee of an

workweek.
(3) Paid sick time requirements provided under the Nebraska Healthy
Families and Workplaces Act as provided in this section shall begin to accrue
at the commencement of employment or October 1, 2025 , whichever is later. An

and before October 1, 2025, shall be counted toward an employer's obligations
under the Nebraska Healthy Families and Workplaces Act for calendar year 2025.
(5) (4) Accrued paid sick time shall be carried over to the following
year. A small business is not required to permit an employee to use more than
forty hours of paid sick time per year, and other employers are not required to
permit an employee to use more than fifty-six hours of paid sick time per year.
(6) In Alternatively, in lieu of carryover of unused paid sick time
provided pursuant to this section from one year to the next, an employer may
pay an employee for unused paid sick time provided pursuant to this section at
the end of a year and provide the employee with an amount of paid sick time
that meets or exceeds the requirements of subsections (1) and (3) of this
section that is available for the employee's immediate use at the beginning of
the subsequent year.
(7) (5) Any employer with a paid leave policy, such as a paid time off
policy, who makes available an amount of paid leave that equals or exceeds
sufficient to meet the requirements of the Nebraska Healthy Families and
Workplaces Act and that may be used for the same purposes and under the same
conditions as paid sick time in accordance with section 3 of this act under the
act is not required to provide additional paid sick time under the act and is
not obligated to allow an employee to accrue or carryover benefits beyond the
employer's existing paid leave policy.
(8) (6) At its discretion, an employer may loan paid sick time to an
employee in advance of accrual by such employee.
(9) (7) If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity, or
location, but remains employed by the same employer, the employee is entitled
to all paid sick time accrued at the prior division, entity, or location and is
entitled to use all paid sick time as provided in the Nebraska Healthy Families
and Workplaces Act. When there is a separation from employment and the employee
is rehired within twelve months of separation by the same employer, previously
accrued paid sick time that had not been used or paid out to the employee shall
be reinstated. The employee shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick time and
accrue additional paid sick time at the recommencement of employment.
(10) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require employers to
pay an employee for unused paid sick time upon the employee's separation from
employment.
Sec. 3. Section 4, Initiative Law 2024, No. 436, is amended to read:
Sec. 4. (1) Paid sick time shall be provided to an employee by an employer

health condition; care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis, care, or
-2-

LB415 LB415
2025 2025
treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; care of
a family member who needs preventive medical care; or in the case of a child,
to attend a meeting necessitated by the child's mental or physical illness,
injury, or health condition, at a school or place where the child is receiving
care; or
(c) Closure of the employee's place of business by order of a public
official due to a public health emergency; an employee's need to care for a
child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public
official due to a public health emergency; or an employee's need to self-
isolate or care for the employee or a family member when it has been determined
by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care professional
that the employee's or family member's presence in the community may jeopardize
the health of others because of exposure to a communicable disease, whether or
not the employee or family member has actually contracted the communicable
disease.
(2) Paid sick time under this section shall be provided upon the oral
request of an employee in compliance with the Nebraska Healthy Families and
Workplaces Act. When possible, the request shall include the expected duration
of the absence.
(3) An employer that requires notice of the need to use paid sick time in
accordance with this section shall provide a written policy that contains
reasonable procedures for employees to provide notice. An employer that has not
provided to the employee a copy of such written policy shall not deny paid sick
time to the employee based on noncompliance with such a policy.
(4) An employer shall not require, as a condition of an employee's taking
paid sick time under this section, that the employee search for or find a
replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is using paid
sick time.
(5) Paid sick time under this section may be used in the smaller of hourly
increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll system uses to
account for absences or use of other time.
(6) For use of paid sick time for more than three consecutive work days,
an employer may require reasonable documentation that the paid sick time has
been used for a purpose covered by subsection (1) of this section. Reasonable
documentation shall include (a) documentation signed by a health care
professional indicating that paid sick time is or was necessary or (b) if the
employee or a family member did not receive services from a health care
professional, or if documentation cannot be obtained from a health care
professional in reasonable time or without added expense, a written statement
from the employee indicating that the employee is taking or took paid sick time
for a qualifying purpose covered by subsection (1) of this section.
(7) An employer signatory to a multi-employer collective-bargaining
agreement may fulfill its obligations under the Nebraska Healthy Families and
Workplaces Act by making contributions to a multi-employer paid sick time fund,
plan, or program based on the hours each employee accrues pursuant to the act
while working under the multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement, if the
fund, plan, or program enables employees to collect paid sick time from the
fund, plan, or program based on hours they have worked under the multi-employer
collective-bargaining agreement and for the purposes specified under the act.
Employees who work under a multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement into
which their employers make contributions as provided in this subsection may
collect from the paid sick time fund, plan, or program based on hours they have
worked under the multi-employer collective-bargaining agreement and for the
purposes specified under the act.
Sec. 4. Section 8, Initiative Law 2024, No. 436, is amended to read:
Sec. 8. (1) The Commissioner of Labor shall issue a citation to an
employer when an investigation reveals that the employer may have violated the
Nebraska Healthy Families and Workplaces Act.
(2) When a citation is issued, the commissioner shall notify the employer
of the proposed administrative penalty, if any, by certified mail, by any other
manner of delivery by which the United States Postal Service can verify
delivery, or by any method of service recognized under Chapter 25, article 5.
The administrative penalty shall not be more than five hundred dollars in the
case of a first violation and not more than five thousand dollars in the case
of a second or subsequent violation.
(3) The employer has fifteen working days after the date of the citation
or penalty to contest such citation or penalty. Notice of contest shall be sent
to the commissioner who shall provide a hearing in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure Act.
(4) Any employer who has an unpaid citation for a violation of the
Nebraska Healthy Families and Workplaces Act shall be barred from contracting
with the state or any political subdivision until such citation is paid. If a
citation has been contested as described in subsection (3) of this section, it
shall not be considered an unpaid citation under this subsection until after
such contest has been resolved.
(5) Citations issued under this section and the names of employers who
have been issued a citation shall be made available to the public upon request,
except that this subsection shall not apply to any citations that are being
contested as described in subsection (3) of this section.
(6) An employee having a claim for a violation of the Nebraska Healthy
Families and Workplaces Act may institute suit for legal and equitable relief
in the proper court. In any action brought to enforce the Nebraska Healthy
Families and Workplaces Act, the court shall have jurisdiction to grant such
-3-

LB415 LB415
2025 2025
legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate to effectuate the
purposes of the act. If an employee establishes a claim and secures judgment on
the claim, such employee shall also be entitled to recover the full amount of
the judgment and all costs of such suit, including reasonable attorney's fees.
(7) If an employee institutes suit against an employer under subsection
(6) of this section, any citation that is issued against an employer under
subsection (1) of this section and that relates directly to the facts in
dispute shall be admitted into evidence unless specifically excluded by the
court. If a citation has been contested as described in subsection (3) of this
section, it shall not be admitted into evidence under this subsection until
such contest has been resolved.
(8) A civil action brought under this section shall be commenced no later
than four calendar years after the cause of action accrues.
