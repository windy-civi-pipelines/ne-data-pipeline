5 68-1017.02 (1)(a) The Department of Health and Human Services shall
6 apply for and utilize to the maximum extent possible, within limits

1 (c) The Health and Human Services Committee of the Legislature,
2 after receipt and evaluation of the report required in subdivision (b) of
3 this subsection, shall issue recommendations to the department on any
4 further action necessary by the department to meet the requirements of
5 this section.
6 (2)(a) The department shall develop a state outreach plan to promote
7 access by eligible persons to benefits of the Supplemental Nutrition
8 Assistance Program. The plan shall meet the criteria established by the
9 Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture
10 for approval of state outreach plans. The Department of Health and Human
11 Services may apply for and accept gifts, grants, and donations to develop
12 and implement the state outreach plan.
13 (b) For purposes of developing and implementing the state outreach
14 plan, the department shall partner with one or more counties or nonprofit
15 organizations. If the department enters into a contract with a nonprofit
16 organization relating to the state outreach plan, the contract may
17 specify that the nonprofit organization is responsible for seeking
18 sufficient gifts, grants, or donations necessary for the development and
19 implementation of the state outreach plan and may additionally specify
20 that any costs to the department associated with the award and management
21 of the contract or the implementation or administration of the state
22 outreach plan shall be paid out of private or federal funds received for
23 development and implementation of the state outreach plan.
24 (c) The department shall submit the state outreach plan to the Food
25 and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture for
26 approval on or before August 1, 2011, and shall request any federal
27 matching funds that may be available upon approval of the state outreach
28 plan. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Nebraska and
29 the Department of Health and Human Services use any additional public or
30 private funds to offset costs associated with increased caseload
31 resulting from the implementation of the state outreach plan.

1 (d) The department shall be exempt from implementing or
2 administering a state outreach plan under this subsection, but not from
3 developing such a plan, if it does not receive private or federal funds
4 sufficient to cover the department's costs associated with the
5 implementation and administration of the plan, including any costs
6 associated with increased caseload resulting from the implementation of
7 the plan.
8 (3)(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that:
9 (i) Hard work be rewarded and no disincentives to work exist for
10 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants;
11 (ii) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants be
12 enabled to advance in employment, through greater earnings or new,
13 better-paying employment;
14 (iii) Participants in employment and training pilot programs be able
15 to maintain Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits while
16 seeking employment with higher wages that allow them to reduce or
17 terminate such program benefits; and
18 (iv) Nebraska better utilize options under the Supplemental
19 Nutrition Assistance Program that other states have implemented to
20 encourage work and employment.
21 (b)(i) The department shall create a TANF-funded program or policy
22 that, in compliance with federal law, establishes categorical eligibility
23 for federal food assistance benefits pursuant to the Supplemental
24 Nutrition Assistance Program to maximize the number of Nebraska residents
25 being served under such program in a manner that does not increase the
26 current gross income eligibility limit except as otherwise provided in
27 subdivision (3)(b)(ii) of this section.
28 (ii) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, such TANF-
29 funded program or policy shall increase the gross income eligibility
30 limit to one hundred sixty-five percent of the federal Office of
31 Management and Budget income poverty guidelines as allowed under federal

1 law and under 7 C.F.R. 273.2(j)(2), as such law and regulation existed on
2 April 1, 2021, but shall not increase the net income eligibility limit.
3 Beginning October 1, 2025, the gross income eligibility limit shall
4 return to the amount used prior to the increase required by this
5 subdivision. The department shall evaluate the TANF-funded program or
6 policy created pursuant to this subsection and provide a report
7 electronically to the Health and Human Services Committee of the
8 Legislature and the Legislative Fiscal Analyst on or before December 15
9 of each year regarding the gross income eligibility limit and whether it
10 maximizes the number of Nebraska residents being served under the program
11 or policy. The evaluation shall include an identification and
12 determination of additional administrative costs resulting from the
13 increase to the gross income eligibility limit, a recommendation
14 regarding the gross income eligibility limit, and a determination of the
15 availability of federal funds for the program or policy.
16 (iii) To the extent federal funds are available to the Department of
17 Labor for the SNAP Next Step Program, until September 30, 2023, any
18 recipient of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits whose
19 household income is between one hundred thirty-one and one hundred sixty-
20 five percent of the federal Office of Management and Budget income
21 poverty guidelines and who is not exempt from work participation
22 requirements shall be encouraged to participate in the SNAP Next Step
23 Program administered by the Department of Labor if the recipient is
24 eligible to participate in the program and the program's services are
25 available in the county in which such household is located. It is the
26 intent of the Legislature that no General Funds be utilized by the
27 Department of Labor for the processes outlined in this subdivision (iii).
28 For purposes of this section, SNAP Next Step Program means a partnership
29 program between the Department of Health and Human Services and the
30 Department of Labor to assist under-employed and unemployed recipients of
31 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in finding self-

1 sufficient employment.
2 (iv) Such TANF-funded program or policy shall eliminate all asset
3 limits for eligibility for federal food assistance benefits, except that
4 the total of liquid assets which includes cash on hand and funds in
5 personal checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, and share
6 accounts shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars pursuant to the
7 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as allowed under federal law
8 and under 7 C.F.R. 273.2(j)(2).
9 (v) This subsection becomes effective only if the department
10 receives funds pursuant to federal participation that may be used to
11 implement this subsection.
12 (c) For purposes of this subsection:
13 (i) Federal law means the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, 7
14 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., and regulations adopted under the act; and
15 (ii) TANF means the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
16 program established in 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
17 (4)(a) As authorized in 21 U.S.C. 862, as such section existed on
18 January 1, 2025 Within the limits specified in this subsection, the State
19 of Nebraska opts out of the provision of the federal Personal
20 Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as such
21 act existed on January 1, 2009, that eliminates eligibility for the
22 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for any person convicted of a
23 felony involving the possession, use, or distribution of a controlled
24 substance.
25 (b)(i) (b) A person convicted of a felony involving the possession,
26 use, or distribution of a controlled substance shall only be eligible for
27 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits under this subsection
28 if such person (A) has completed the person's sentence for such felony or
29 (B) is serving a term of parole, probation, or post-release supervision
30 for the felony.

5 for the possession or use of a controlled substance or (ii) has been
6 convicted of a felony involving the sale or distribution of a controlled
7 substance or the intent to sell or distribute a controlled substance. A
8 person with three or more one or two felony convictions for the
9 possession or use of a controlled substance shall only be eligible to
10 receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits under this
11 subsection if the person (A) he or she is participating in, or has
12 completed, a state-licensed or nationally accredited substance abuse
13 treatment program since the date of the most recent conviction or (B) has
14 completed a treatment program while the person was incarcerated, on
15 probation, or on parole. The determination of such participation or
16 completion shall be made by the treatment provider administering the
17 program.
