3 68-1017.02 (1)(a) The Department of Health and Human Services shall
4 apply for and utilize to the maximum extent possible, within limits
5 established by the Legislature, any and all appropriate options available
6 to the state under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
7 and regulations adopted under such program to maximize the number of
8 Nebraska residents being served under such program within such limits.
9 The department shall seek to maximize federal funding for such program
10 and minimize the utilization of General Funds for such program and shall
11 employ the personnel necessary to determine the options available to the
12 state and issue the report to the Legislature required by subdivision (b)
13 of this subsection.
14 (b) The department shall submit electronically an annual report to
15 the Health and Human Services Committee of the Legislature by December 1
16 on efforts by the department to carry out the provisions of this
17 subsection. Such report shall provide the committee with all necessary
18 and appropriate information to enable the committee to conduct a
19 meaningful evaluation of such efforts. Such information shall include,
20 but not be limited to, a clear description of various options available
21 to the state under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,
22 the department's evaluation of and any action taken by the department

27 after receipt and evaluation of the report required in subdivision (b) of

24 private funds to offset costs associated with increased caseload
25 resulting from the implementation of the state outreach plan.
26 (d) The department shall be exempt from implementing or
27 administering a state outreach plan under this subsection, but not from
28 developing such a plan, if it does not receive private or federal funds
29 sufficient to cover the department's costs associated with the
30 implementation and administration of the plan, including any costs
31 associated with increased caseload resulting from the implementation of
-3-
LB319 LB319

11 terminate such program benefits; and
12 (iv) Nebraska better utilize options under the Supplemental
13 Nutrition Assistance Program that other states have implemented to
14 encourage work and employment.
15 (b)(i) The department shall create a TANF-funded program or policy
16 that, in compliance with federal law, establishes categorical eligibility
17 for federal food assistance benefits pursuant to the Supplemental
18 Nutrition Assistance Program to maximize the number of Nebraska residents
19 being served under such program in a manner that does not increase the
20 current gross income eligibility limit except as otherwise provided in
21 subdivision (3)(b)(ii) of this section.
22 (ii) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, such TANF-
23 funded program or policy shall increase the gross income eligibility
24 limit to one hundred sixty-five percent of the federal Office of
25 Management and Budget income poverty guidelines as allowed under federal
26 law and under 7 C.F.R. 273.2(j)(2), as such law and regulation existed on
27 April 1, 2021, but shall not increase the net income eligibility limit.
28 Beginning October 1, 2025, the gross income eligibility limit shall
29 return to the amount used prior to the increase required by this

11 Labor for the SNAP Next Step Program, until September 30, 2023, any
12 recipient of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits whose
13 household income is between one hundred thirty-one and one hundred sixty-
14 five percent of the federal Office of Management and Budget income
15 poverty guidelines and who is not exempt from work participation
16 requirements shall be encouraged to participate in the SNAP Next Step
17 Program administered by the Department of Labor if the recipient is
18 eligible to participate in the program and the program's services are
19 available in the county in which such household is located. It is the
20 intent of the Legislature that no General Funds be utilized by the
21 Department of Labor for the processes outlined in this subdivision (iii).

31 accounts shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars pursuant to the

1 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as allowed under federal law
2 and under 7 C.F.R. 273.2(j)(2).
3 (v) This subsection becomes effective only if the department
4 receives funds pursuant to federal participation that may be used to
5 implement this subsection.
6 (c) For purposes of this subsection:

11 (4)(a) As authorized in 21 U.S.C. 862, as such section existed on
12 January 1, 2025 Within the limits specified in this subsection, the State
13 of Nebraska opts out of the provision of the federal Personal
14 Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as such
15 act existed on January 1, 2009, that eliminates eligibility for the
16 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for any person convicted of a
17 felony involving the possession, use, or distribution of a controlled
18 substance.
19 (b) A person convicted of a felony involving the possession, use, or
20 distribution of a controlled substance shall only be eligible for
