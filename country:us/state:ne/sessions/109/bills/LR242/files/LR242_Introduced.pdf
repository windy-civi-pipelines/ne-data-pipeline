LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 242
Introduced by Spivey, 13; McKinney, 11.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the current structure, function, and authority of the Board of Parole.
The study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Exploring the appropriate composition and qualifications of board
members to best reflect the expertise needed for parole decisions;
(2) Reviewing the appointment process and length of terms for board
members, including accountability and consistency;
(3) Analyzing the criteria and procedures used in parole hearings and
decision-making;
(4) Evaluating the administrative independence of the Board of Parole and
the board's capacity and staffing to meet the growing demand for parole
hearings;
(5) Examining models from other states that have restructured or updated
their parole boards to improve outcomes, reduce recidivism, and address racial
and socioeconomic disparities in parole decisions; and
(6) Studying how the Board of Parole's decisions impact prison population
levels, public safety, and reentry outcomes across Nebraska.
In conducting this interim study, the Judiciary Committee of the
Legislature may confer with formerly incarcerated individuals, criminal justice
reform advocates, law enforcement representatives, parole officers, victims'
advocacy organizations, public officials, and other stakeholders to assess how
to align the Board of Parole with best practices.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
