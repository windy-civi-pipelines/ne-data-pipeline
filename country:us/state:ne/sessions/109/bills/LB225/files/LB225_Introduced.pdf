1 Section 1. Section 60-168, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 60-168 (1) In the event of a lost or mutilated certificate of title,
4 the owner of the vehicle or the holder of a lien on the vehicle shall
5 apply, upon a form prescribed by the department, to the department or to
6 any county treasurer for a duplicate certificate of title and shall pay
7 the fee prescribed by section 60-156. The application shall be signed and
8 sworn to by the person making the application or a person authorized to
9 sign under section 60-151. Thereupon the county treasurer, with the
10 approval of the department, or the department shall issue a duplicate
11 certificate of title to the person entitled to receive the certificate of
12 title. If the records of the title have been destroyed pursuant to
13 section 60-152, the county treasurer shall issue a duplicate certificate
14 of title to the person entitled to receive the same upon such showing as
15 the county treasurer may deem sufficient. If the applicant cannot produce
16 such proof of ownership, he or she may apply directly to the department
17 and submit such evidence as he or she may have, and the department may,
18 if it finds the evidence sufficient, authorize the county treasurer to
19 issue a duplicate certificate of title. A duplicate certificate of title
20 so issued shall show only those unreleased liens of record. The new
21 purchaser shall be entitled to receive an original certificate of title
22 upon presentation of the assigned duplicate copy of the certificate of
23 title, properly assigned to the new purchaser, to the county treasurer
24 prescribed in section 60-144.
25 (2) Any purchaser of a vehicle for which a certificate of title was
26 lost or mutilated may at the time of purchase require the seller of the
27 same to indemnify him or her and all subsequent purchasers of the vehicle
28 against any loss which he, she, or they may suffer by reason of any claim
29 presented upon the original certificate. In the event of the recovery of
30 the original certificate of title by the owner, he or she shall forthwith
31 surrender the same to the county treasurer or the department for
