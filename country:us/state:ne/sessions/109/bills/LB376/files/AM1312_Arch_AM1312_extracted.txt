2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Section 28-3,107, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
4 is amended to read:
5 28-3,107 (1) Any physician who performs or induces or attempts to
6 perform or induce an abortion shall report to the Department of Health
7 and Human Services, on a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules
8 and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department:
9 (a) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was made,
10 the probable postfertilization age determined and the method and basis of
11 the determination;
12 (b) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was not
13 made, the basis of the determination that a medical emergency existed;
14 (c) If the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
15 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
16 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, the basis of the determination that the
17 pregnant woman had a condition which so complicated her medical condition
18 as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to
19 avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
20 a major bodily function, or the basis of the determination that it was
21 necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child; and
22 (d) The method used for the abortion and, in the case of an abortion
23 performed when the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
24 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
25 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, whether the method of abortion used was one
26 that, in reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for

DLM - 05/07/2025 DLM - 05/07/2025
1 the unborn child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
2 of the determination that termination of the pregnancy in that manner
3 would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant woman or of
4 the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
5 function of the woman than would other available methods.
6 (2) By June 30 of each year, the department shall issue a public
7 report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from
8 all of the reports covering that year submitted in accordance with this
9 section for each of the items listed in subsection (1) of this section.
10 Each such report shall also provide the statistics for all previous
11 calendar years during which this section was in effect, adjusted to
12 reflect any additional information from late or corrected reports. The
13 department shall take care to ensure that none of the information
14 included in the public reports could reasonably lead to the
15 identification of any pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed.
16 (3) Any physician who fails to submit a report by the end of thirty
17 days following the due date shall be subject to a late fee of five
18 hundred dollars for each additional thirty-day period or portion of a
19 thirty-day period the report is overdue. Any physician required to report
20 in accordance with the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act who has
21 not submitted a report, or has submitted only an incomplete report, more
22 than one year following the due date, may, in an action brought in the
23 manner in which actions are brought to enforce the Uniform Credentialing
24 Act pursuant to section 38-1,139, be directed by a court of competent
25 jurisdiction to submit a complete report within a time period stated by
26 court order or be subject to civil contempt. Failure by any physician to
27 conform to any requirement of this section, other than late filing of a
28 report, constitutes unprofessional conduct pursuant to section 38-2021.
29 Failure by any physician to submit a complete report in accordance with a
30 court order constitutes unprofessional conduct pursuant to section
31 38-2021. Intentional or reckless falsification of any report required
