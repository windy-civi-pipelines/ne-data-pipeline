1 Section 1. Section 28-3,107, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
2 is amended to read:
3 28-3,107 (1) Any physician who performs or induces or attempts to
4 perform or induce an abortion shall report to the Department of Health
5 and Human Services, on a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules
6 and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department:
7 (a) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was made,
8 the probable postfertilization age determined and the method and basis of
9 the determination;
10 (b) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was not
11 made, the basis of the determination that a medical emergency existed;
12 (c) If the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
13 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
14 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, the basis of the determination that the
15 pregnant woman had a condition which so complicated her medical condition
16 as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to
17 avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
18 a major bodily function, or the basis of the determination that it was
19 necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child; and
20 (d) The method used for the abortion and, in the case of an abortion
21 performed when the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
22 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
23 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, whether the method of abortion used was one
24 that, in reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for
25 the unborn child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
26 of the determination that termination of the pregnancy in that manner
27 would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant woman or of
28 the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
29 function of the woman than would other available methods.
30 (2) By June 30 of each year, the department shall issue a public
31 report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from
-3-
LB376 LB376
2025 2025

2 section for each of the items listed in subsection (1) of this section.
3 Each such report shall also provide the statistics for all previous
4 calendar years during which this section was in effect, adjusted to
5 reflect any additional information from late or corrected reports. The
6 department shall take care to ensure that none of the information
7 included in the public reports could reasonably lead to the
8 identification of any pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed.
9 (3) Any physician who fails to submit a report by the end of thirty
10 days following the due date shall be subject to a late fee of five
11 hundred dollars for each additional thirty-day period or portion of a

13 in accordance with the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act who has
14 not submitted a report, or has submitted only an incomplete report, more
15 than one year following the due date, may, in an action brought in the
16 manner in which actions are brought to enforce the Uniform Credentialing
17 Act pursuant to section 38-1,139, be directed by a court of competent
18 jurisdiction to submit a complete report within a time period stated by
19 court order or be subject to civil contempt. Failure by any physician to
20 conform to any requirement of this section, other than late filing of a
21 report, constitutes unprofessional conduct pursuant to section 38-2021.
22 Failure by any physician to submit a complete report in accordance with a
23 court order constitutes unprofessional conduct pursuant to section
24 38-2021. Intentional or reckless falsification of any report required
25 under this section is a Class V misdemeanor.
26 (4) Within ninety days after October 15, 2010, the department shall
27 adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to assist in compliance with
28 this section.

8 (d) Develop and implement with the department a procedure in which

10 adjustment, including (i) the resubmission of claims denied as a result
11 of an interpretation of scope of services not previously held by the
12 department, (ii) the resubmission of documentation when the document
13 provided is incomplete, illegible, or unclear, and (iii) the resubmission
14 of documentation when clerical errors resulted in a denial of claims for

16 documented but denied because it was determined by the department or the
17 contractor that a different service should have been provided, the
18 department or the contractor shall disallow the difference between the
19 payment for the service that was provided and the payment for the service
20 that should have been provided;
21 (e) Utilize a licensed health care professional from the specialty

23 consistent with (i) state-issued medicaid provider handbooks and (ii)

11 credible allegation of fraudulent activity by the provider, the
12 contractor has referred the claims to the department for investigation,
13 and an investigation has commenced. In that event, the contractor may
14 recover overpayment prior to the conclusion of the appeals process. In

1 the contractor, the provider may request an informal consultation with
2 the contractor to discuss and attempt to resolve the findings or portion
3 of such findings in the preliminary findings letter. The request shall be
4 made to the contractor. The consultation shall occur within thirty days
5 after the provider's request for informal consultation, unless otherwise
6 agreed to by both parties.

2 is amended to read:
3 28-3,107 (1) Any physician who performs or induces or attempts to
4 perform or induce an abortion shall report to the Department of Health
5 and Human Services, on a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules
6 and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department:
7 (a) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was made,
8 the probable postfertilization age determined and the method and basis of
9 the determination;
10 (b) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was not
11 made, the basis of the determination that a medical emergency existed;
12 (c) If the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
13 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
14 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, the basis of the determination that the
15 pregnant woman had a condition which so complicated her medical condition
16 as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to
17 avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
18 a major bodily function, or the basis of the determination that it was
19 necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child; and
20 (d) The method used for the abortion and, in the case of an abortion
21 performed when the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
22 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
23 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, whether the method of abortion used was one
24 that, in reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for
25 the unborn child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
26 of the determination that termination of the pregnancy in that manner
27 would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant woman or of
28 the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
29 function of the woman than would other available methods.
30 (2) By June 30 of each year, the department shall issue a public
31 report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from

17 Act pursuant to section 38-1,139, be directed by a court of competent
18 jurisdiction to submit a complete report within a time period stated by

11 credible allegation of fraudulent activity by the provider, the
12 contractor has referred the claims to the department for investigation,
13 and an investigation has commenced. In that event, the contractor may
14 recover overpayment prior to the conclusion of the appeals process. In
