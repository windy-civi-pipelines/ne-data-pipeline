Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Section 28-3,107, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
28-3,107 (1) Any physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform
or induce an abortion shall report to the Department of Health and Human
Services, on a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules and regulations
adopted and promulgated by the department:
(a) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was made, the
probable postfertilization age determined and the method and basis of the
determination;
(b) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was not made, the
basis of the determination that a medical emergency existed;
(c) If the probable postfertilization age was determined to be consistent
with the postfertilization age limits provided in section 71-6915 twenty or
more weeks, the basis of the determination that the pregnant woman had a
condition which so complicated her medical condition as to necessitate the
abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of
substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, or
the basis of the determination that it was necessary to preserve the life of an
unborn child; and
(d) The method used for the abortion and, in the case of an abortion
performed when the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section 71-6915
twenty or more weeks, whether the method of abortion used was one that, in
reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn child
to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis of the determination
that termination of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk
either of the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and
irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman than
would other available methods.
(2) By June 30 of each year, the department shall issue a public report
providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from all of the
reports covering that year submitted in accordance with this section for each
of the items listed in subsection (1) of this section. Each such report shall
also provide the statistics for all previous calendar years during which this

or corrected reports. The department shall take care to ensure that none of the
information included in the public reports could reasonably lead to the
identification of any pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed.
(3) Any physician who fails to submit a report by the end of thirty days
following the due date shall be subject to a late fee of five hundred dollars
for each additional thirty-day period or portion of a thirty-day period the
report is overdue. Any physician required to report in accordance with the
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act who has not submitted a report, or has
submitted only an incomplete report, more than one year following the due date,
may, in an action brought in the manner in which actions are brought to enforce
the Uniform Credentialing Act pursuant to section 38-1,139, be directed by a
court of competent jurisdiction to submit a complete report within a time
period stated by court order or be subject to civil contempt. Failure by any
physician to conform to any requirement of this section, other than late filing
of a report, constitutes unprofessional conduct pursuant to section 38-2021.

order constitutes unprofessional conduct pursuant to section 38-2021.
