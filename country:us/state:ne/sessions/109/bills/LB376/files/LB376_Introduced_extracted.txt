1 Section 1. Section 28-3,107, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
2 is amended to read:
3 28-3,107 (1) Any physician who performs or induces or attempts to
4 perform or induce an abortion shall report to the Department of Health
5 and Human Services, on a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules
6 and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department:
7 (a) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was made,
8 the probable postfertilization age determined and the method and basis of
9 the determination;
10 (b) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was not
11 made, the basis of the determination that a medical emergency existed;
12 (c) If the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
13 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
14 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, the basis of the determination that the
15 pregnant woman had a condition which so complicated her medical condition
16 as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to
17 avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
18 a major bodily function, or the basis of the determination that it was
19 necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child; and
20 (d) The method used for the abortion and, in the case of an abortion
21 performed when the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
22 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
23 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, whether the method of abortion used was one
24 that, in reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for
25 the unborn child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
26 of the determination that termination of the pregnancy in that manner
27 would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant woman or of
28 the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
29 function of the woman than would other available methods.
30 (2) By June 30 of each year, the department shall issue a public
31 report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from
-3-

2 section for each of the items listed in subsection (1) of this section.
3 Each such report shall also provide the statistics for all previous
4 calendar years during which this section was in effect, adjusted to
5 reflect any additional information from late or corrected reports. The

9 (3) Any physician who fails to submit a report by the end of thirty
10 days following the due date shall be subject to a late fee of five
11 hundred dollars for each additional thirty-day period or portion of a

15 than one year following the due date, may, in an action brought in the

17 Act pursuant to section 38-1,139, be directed by a court of competent
18 jurisdiction to submit a complete report within a time period stated by

3 and implement a quality management and improvement plan to promote and
4 monitor quality relating to services and quality of life for persons with
5 developmental disabilities.
6 (b) The purpose of the quality management and improvement plan is to
7 provide information necessary for an accurate assessment of the quality
8 and effectiveness of services for persons with developmental disabilities
9 and their families and the delivery of such services, with special
10 attention to the impact that the services have on the quality of life of
11 recipients and their families.
12 (c) The quality management and improvement plan shall reflect
13 national best practice for services for persons with developmental
14 disabilities and their families as determined by the department with the
15 assistance of the advisory committee.
16 (d) The quality management and improvement plan shall assess,
17 through both quantitative and qualitative means, (i) the quality of
18 services provided to persons with developmental disabilities and their
19 families, (ii) the ability of the services provided to meet the needs of
20 the recipients of the services, (iii) the effect of the services to
21 support or improve the quality of life of the recipients of the services,
22 and (iv) the satisfaction of the recipients with the process of
23 determination of eligibility and the process of delivery of the services.
24 In order to develop the quality management and improvement plan, the
25 department shall use procedures to collect data from recipients of
26 services for persons with disabilities and their families by relying on
27 external, independent evaluators who are not employed by the department.
28 The quality management and improvement plan shall give significance to
29 input gathered from recipients of services for persons with developmental
30 disabilities and families of such recipients and include information

1 Section 1. Section 28-3,107, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
2 is amended to read:
3 28-3,107 (1) Any physician who performs or induces or attempts to
4 perform or induce an abortion shall report to the Department of Health
5 and Human Services, on a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules
6 and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department:
7 (a) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was made,
8 the probable postfertilization age determined and the method and basis of
9 the determination;
10 (b) If a determination of probable postfertilization age was not
11 made, the basis of the determination that a medical emergency existed;
12 (c) If the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
13 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
14 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, the basis of the determination that the
15 pregnant woman had a condition which so complicated her medical condition
16 as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to
17 avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
18 a major bodily function, or the basis of the determination that it was
19 necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child; and
20 (d) The method used for the abortion and, in the case of an abortion
21 performed when the probable postfertilization age was determined to be
22 consistent with the postfertilization age limits provided in section
23 71-6915 twenty or more weeks, whether the method of abortion used was one
24 that, in reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for
25 the unborn child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
26 of the determination that termination of the pregnancy in that manner
27 would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant woman or of
28 the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
29 function of the woman than would other available methods.
30 (2) By June 30 of each year, the department shall issue a public
31 report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from
-3-

3 Each such report shall also provide the statistics for all previous
4 calendar years during which this section was in effect, adjusted to
5 reflect any additional information from late or corrected reports. The

9 (3) Any physician who fails to submit a report by the end of thirty
10 days following the due date shall be subject to a late fee of five
11 hundred dollars for each additional thirty-day period or portion of a

17 Act pursuant to section 38-1,139, be directed by a court of competent
18 jurisdiction to submit a complete report within a time period stated by

22 (2) A parent or guardian who refuses to pay hospital costs, medical
23 costs, or any other costs arising out of or in connection with an

6 (b) The purpose of the quality management and improvement plan is to
7 provide information necessary for an accurate assessment of the quality

9 and their families and the delivery of such services, with special
10 attention to the impact that the services have on the quality of life of
11 recipients and their families.
12 (c) The quality management and improvement plan shall reflect
13 national best practice for services for persons with developmental
14 disabilities and their families as determined by the department with the
15 assistance of the advisory committee.
16 (d) The quality management and improvement plan shall assess,
17 through both quantitative and qualitative means, (i) the quality of
18 services provided to persons with developmental disabilities and their
19 families, (ii) the ability of the services provided to meet the needs of
20 the recipients of the services, (iii) the effect of the services to
21 support or improve the quality of life of the recipients of the services,
22 and (iv) the satisfaction of the recipients with the process of
23 determination of eligibility and the process of delivery of the services.
24 In order to develop the quality management and improvement plan, the
25 department shall use procedures to collect data from recipients of
26 services for persons with disabilities and their families by relying on
27 external, independent evaluators who are not employed by the department.

29 input gathered from recipients of services for persons with developmental
30 disabilities and families of such recipients and include information
