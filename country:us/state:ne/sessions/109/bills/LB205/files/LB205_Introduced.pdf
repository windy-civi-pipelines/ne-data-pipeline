1 claimant for medically necessary treatment or medically necessary

3 (5) This section does not impose an affirmative duty upon any party
4 to seek a reduction in billed charges to which the party is not

13 (2) The total amount recoverable per plaintiff for noneconomic
14 damages in a civil action for personal injury or death involving a
15 commercial motor vehicle requiring a commercial driver's license, whether

18 liability in the civil action.

20 (2) of this section:
21 (a) If the action is tried before a jury, the jury shall first make

24 limit, the court shall then reduce the award to comply with such limit;
25 and
26 (b) If the action is tried without a jury, the court shall first
27 make a finding as to noneconomic damages without regard to the limit in
