16 means of one online sports wagering platform and may contract with one

18 individual or entity that does not have a contract with an authorized
19 gaming operator to conduct sports wagering by means of an online sports
20 wagering platform shall not be permitted to conduct sports wagering in

2025 2025

2 days after the commission adopts and promulgates rules and regulations
3 relating to online sports wagering. The commission shall have thirty days
4 to review and approve or deny proposed controls submitted by an
5 authorized gaming operator or a platform provider that has contracted
6 with an authorized gaming operator. All authorized gaming operators or
7 platform providers that have contracted with an authorized gaming
8 operator that submit controls within thirty days of the date on which the
9 commission first begins to accept controls, if such controls are
10 approved, shall be given an equal opportunity to commence offering and
11 conducting online sports wagering on the same day, which shall be no
12 later than sixty days from the date that the commission first begins to
13 accept controls. No authorized gaming operator or platform provider shall
14 conduct sports wagering by means of an online sports wagering platform
15 until the controls for such online sports wagering platform are approved
16 by the commission.

18 including the location of any wagering kiosks, shall be filed with the
19 commission for review and approval. Modification to a previously approved

2 deposits and wagers; and
3 (d) An easy and obvious method for a player to make a complaint and
4 to enable the player to notify the commission if such complaint has not
5 been or cannot be addressed by the sports wagering operator.
6 (4) The commission shall develop policies and procedures to ensure a
7 prohibited participant is unable to place a sports wager or parimutuel
8 wager.
9 (5) Beginning on the implementation date designated by the Tax
10 Commissioner pursuant to subsection (1) of section 9-1312, prior to the
11 winnings payment of any sports wagering winnings as defined in section
12 9-1303, an authorized gaming operator shall check the collection system
13 to determine if the winner has a debt or an outstanding state tax
14 liability as required by the Gambling Winnings Setoff for Outstanding
15 Debt Act. If such authorized gaming operator determines that the winner
16 is subject to the collection system, the operator shall deduct the amount
17 of debt and outstanding state tax liability identified in the collection
18 system from the winnings payment and shall remit the net winnings payment
19 of sports wagering winnings, if any, to the winner and the amount
20 deducted to the Department of Revenue to be credited against such debt or
21 outstanding state tax liability as provided in section 9-1306.

2 unincorporated area of a county, the remaining twenty-five percent shall
3 be distributed to the county in which such licensed racetrack enclosure
4 is located; or (b) (2) if the licensed racetrack enclosure is located at
5 least partially within the limits of a city or village in such county,
6 one-half of the remaining twenty-five percent shall be distributed to
7 such county and one-half of the remaining twenty-five percent to the city
8 or village in which such licensed racetrack enclosure is at least
9 partially located.
10 (2) The tax imposed by section 9-1203 on gross gaming revenue
11 generated by sports wagering shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for
