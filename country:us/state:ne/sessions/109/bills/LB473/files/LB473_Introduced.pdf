14 interest or dividends on such deposit.
15 (c) The safekeeping of such securities and all other expenses
16 incidental to the pledging of such securities shall be paid by the

21 may occur only after thirty days' written notice to the director.
22 Cancellation shall not affect any liability incurred or accrued during
23 the period the surety bond was in effect.

25 after the licensee ceases money transmission in this state, except that
26 the director may permit the surety bond to be reduced or eliminated
27 before that time to the extent that the amount of the licensee's payment
28 instruments outstanding in this state are reduced. The director may also
29 permit a licensee to substitute a letter of credit or such other form of
30 security acceptable to the director for the surety bond in place at the
31 time the licensee ceases money transmission in the state.

8 when the licensee applied for its original or renewal license, would have
9 been grounds for denying such application;
10 (b) The licensee's net worth has become inadequate and the licensee,
11 after ten days' written notice from the director, failed to take such
12 steps as the director deems necessary to remedy such deficiency;
13 (c) The licensee knowingly violated any material provision of the

1 (3) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license by delivering to
2 the director written notice of the surrender, but a surrender shall not
