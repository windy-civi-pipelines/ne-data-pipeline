25 of Nebraska that for purposes of applying the federal most-favored-lender

27 comparable or analogous to the small loan rate found in section 70 of
28 this act sections 45-1024 and section 45-350 45-1025. The Legislature

-8-

AM669 AM669
LB474 LB474
QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 different. The Legislature finds that small loan borrowers and bank
2 credit card users are not synonymous or comparable. In establishing a
3 small loan rate, the Legislature has recognized a risk factor that is

5 justifies the charging of a higher interest rate than installment loans,

7 interest rates.

9 from its date, except for nonpayment of premiums and except with respect
10 to limitations of liability which may be contained in the policy relating

5 policy year, the company shall annually ascertain and apportion the
6 amount of divisible surplus to which all such policies, as a separate

5 shall equal or exceed such loan value at the time of such failure, nor
6 until one month after notice shall have been mailed by the company to the

19 policy may be reinstated within three years from such default, upon
20 evidence of insurability satisfactory to the company and payment of
21 arrears of premiums with interest and the payment or reinstatement of any
22 other indebtedness to the company upon such policy.
23 (12) A provision that when a policy shall become a claim by the
24 death of the insured, settlement shall be made upon receipt of due proof

QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 price differential for any goods or services sold under an installment
2 contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual percentage rate
3 and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to exceed eighteen
4 percent per annum, except that a minimum time-price differential of ten
5 dollars may be charged on any installment contract.
6 (b)(i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the
7 installment contract, to pay an origination fee of not to exceed ten
8 dollars, except that if the installment contract is for an installment

14 of not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars if the cash sale price is
15 twenty-five thousand dollars or more.

17 contract is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination fee
18 may be collected from the buyer or included in the principal balance of
19 the installment contract at the time the contract is made and shall not
20 be considered interest or a time-price differential.
21 (c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act prohibits a seller
22 or holder of an installment contract from contracting for, computing, and
23 charging a time-price differential based upon the application of the rate
24 charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually
25 elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used for the purpose of
26 calculating the time-price differential, the time-price balance, the
27 amount of each installment, and the time-sale price.
28 (d) When the installment contract is payable in substantially equal
29 and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential shall
30 be computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined under

3 (2) When an installment contract provides for payment other than in
4 substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price
5 differential may be at a rate which will provide the same return as is
6 permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts under
7 subdivision (1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the schedule of
8 payments.
9 (3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide
10 for payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each
11 installment or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall
12 be determined.

30 been fully paid the subsequent purchases may be included in and

9 (3) The revised payments.
10 A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as
11 provided in and subject to the provisions of section 45-336. When such
12 subsequent purchases are made, the entire amount of all payments made
13 prior to such subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied
14 on previous purchases.
15 Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment contract
16 shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases in the
17 same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the various
18 purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred payment
19 is increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the subsequent
20 payments, at the seller's option, may be deemed to be allocated as
21 follows: An amount equal to the original installment payment to the
22 previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The amount of
23 any initial payment or downpayment on the subsequent purchase shall be
24 allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase. The provisions of
25 this section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or to
26 other merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or

7 clearly sets forth the cash and time-sale prices and other terms of sales
8 to be made through such medium, may be made as provided in this section.
9 All provisions of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act shall apply to such
10 sales except that the seller shall not be required to deliver a copy of

6 on each installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen
7 days, if provided for in the contract, not in excess of five percent of
8 each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu
9 thereof, interest after maturity on each such installment not exceeding
10 the highest permissible contract rate. If the time-price differential is
11 computed by application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal
12 balance for the number of days actually elapsed, such delinquency charge
13 may not exceed five percent of each installment or twenty-five dollars,
14 whichever is less. If any installment payment is made by a check, draft,
15 or similar signed order which is not honored because of insufficient
16 funds, no account, or any other reason except an error of a third party
17 to the contract, the holder may charge and collect a fee of not more than
18 fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such fee may be collected
19 when due or at any time thereafter.

4 misdemeanor.
5 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary,
6 any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the obligation
7 of any contract.
8 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
9 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
10 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
11 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
12 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
13 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
14 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
15 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
16 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
17 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
18 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
19 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
20 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
21 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
22 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
23 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
24 date judgment is obtained.

3 in business activities requiring a license under the Nebraska Installment
4 Loan and Sales Act. The department may examine or investigate complaints

8 contracts, installment loans, and business and examine the books and
9 records of licensees when the director shall so determine. Such
10 examinations shall be conducted as often as determined by the director.
11 (2) The director or the director's duly authorized representative
12 shall have the power to make such investigations as the director or
13 authorized representative shall deem necessary, and to the extent

10 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
11 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil
12 action by the director. The lien shall attach to the real property of
13 such person when notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real
14 property in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
15 real property is located. The lien shall attach to any other property of
16 such person when notice of the lien is filed against the property in the
17 manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and
18 costs shall constitute a separate violation of the Nebraska Installment

21 nontransferable and nonassignable. The same person may obtain additional
22 licenses for each place of business operating as a sales finance company

12 be increased by an additional fifty thousand dollars for each branch
13 location of the applicant that is licensed under the Nebraska Installment
14 Sales Act. The bond shall be for the use of the State of Nebraska and any
15 Nebraska resident who may have claims or causes of action against the

23 assignment, and the amount by which the assigned compensation exceeds the
24 amount of the consideration actually paid, shall, for the purposes of
25 regulation under the act, be deemed interest or charges upon the loan
26 from the date of payment to the date the compensation is payable. Such
27 transaction shall be governed by and be subject to the act.
28 All money collected under the authority of the Nebraska Installment
29 Sales Act shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the

1 amended to read:
2 45-348 Every installment loan licensee shall permit payment to be
3 made in advance in any amount equal to one or more full installments on
4 any loan contract at any time during regular business hours, but the
5 licensee may apply such payment first to all accrued charges in full up
6 to the date of such payment.
7 (1) An installment sales license may be renewed annually on or
8 before December 31 by paying to the director a fee of one hundred fifty
9 dollars, plus one hundred dollars for each branch office, if applicable,
10 and any processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 and
11 by submitting such information as the director may require to indicate
12 any material change in the information contained in the original
13 application or succeeding renewal applications, including a copy of the
14 licensee's most recent annual audit.
15 (2) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license at any time by
16 delivering to the director written notice of the surrender. The
17 department shall cancel the license following such surrender.
18 (3) If a licensee fails to renew its license and does not
19 voluntarily surrender the license pursuant to this section, the
20 department may issue a notice of expiration of the license to the
21 licensee in lieu of revocation proceedings.
22 Sec. 70. (1) Except as provided in section 45-350 and subsection
23 (6) of this section, every installment loan licensee may make loans and
24 may contract for and receive on such loans charges at a rate not
25 exceeding twenty-four percent per annum on that part of the unpaid
26 principal balance on any loan not in excess of one thousand dollars, and
27 twenty-one percent per annum on any remainder of such unpaid principal
28 balance. Except for loans secured by mobile homes, an installment loan
29 licensee may not make loans for a period in excess of one hundred forty-
30 five months if the amount of the loan is greater than three thousand
31 dollars but less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Unless otherwise

1 allowed for by law, charges on loans made under the Nebraska Installment
2 Loan and Sales Act shall not be paid, deducted, or received in advance.
3 The contracting for, charging of, or receiving of charges as provided for
4 in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed to be the payment,
5 deduction, or receipt of such charges in advance.
6 (2) When the loan contract requires repayment in substantially equal
7 and consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined,
8 the installment loan licensee may, at the time the loan is made,
9 precompute the charges at the agreed rate on scheduled unpaid principal
10 balances according to the terms of the contract and add such charges to
11 the principal of the loan. Every payment may be applied to the combined
12 total of principal and precomputed charges until the contract is fully
13 paid. All payments made on account of any loan except for default and
14 deferment charges shall be deemed to be applied to the unpaid
15 installments in the order in which the unpaid installments are due. The
16 portion of the precomputed charges applicable to any particular month of
17 the contract, as originally scheduled or following a deferment, shall be
18 that proportion of such precomputed charges, excluding any adjustment
19 made for a first installment period of more than one month and any
20 adjustment made for deferment, which the balance of the contract
21 scheduled to be outstanding during such month bears to the sum of all
22 monthly balances originally scheduled to be outstanding by the contract.
23 This section shall not limit or restrict the manner of calculating
24 charges, whether by way of add-on, single annual rate, or otherwise, if
25 the rate of charges does not exceed what is permitted by this section.
26 Charges may be contracted for and earned at a single annual rate, except
27 that the total charges from such rate shall not be greater than the total
28 charges from the several rates otherwise applicable to the different
29 portions of the unpaid balance according to subsection (1) of this
30 section. All loan contracts made pursuant to this subsection are subject
31 to the following adjustments:
-137-

AM669 AM669
LB474 LB474
QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 (a) Notwithstanding the requirement for substantially equal and
2 consecutive monthly installments, the first installment period may not
3 exceed one month by more than twenty-one days and may not fall short of
4 one month by more than eleven days. The charges for each day exceeding
5 one month shall be one-thirtieth of the charges which would be applicable
6 to a first installment period of one month. The charge for extra days in
7 the first installment period may be added to the first installment and
8 such charges for such extra days shall be excluded in computing any
9 rebate;
10 (b) If prepayment in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise occurs
11 before the first installment due date, the charges shall be recomputed at
12 the rate of charges contracted for in accordance with this section upon
13 the actual unpaid principal balance of the loan for the actual time
14 outstanding by applying the payment, or payments, first to charges at the
15 agreed rate and the remainder to the principal. The amount of charges so
16 computed shall be retained in lieu of all precomputed charges;
17 (c) If a contract is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
18 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
19 receive a rebate of an amount which is not less than the amount obtained
20 by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or,
21 if deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according
22 to the actuarial method, the rate of charge contracted for in accordance
23 with this section. The licensee may round the rate of charge to the
24 nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently
25 used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any
26 default and deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted
27 from any rebate. No rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment.
28 No rebate of less than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the
29 maturity of the contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If
30 judgment is obtained before the final installment date, the contract
31 balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be required for
-138-

AM669 AM669
LB474 LB474
QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained;
2 (d) If any installment on a precomputed or interest-bearing loan is
3 unpaid in full for ten or more consecutive days, Sundays and holidays
4 included, after it is due, the licensee may charge and collect a default
5 charge not exceeding an amount equal to five percent of such installment.
6 If any installment payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed
7 order which is not honored because of insufficient funds, no account, or
8 any other reason except an error of a third party to the loan contract,
9 the licensee may charge and collect a fifteen-dollar bad check charge.
10 Such default or bad check charges may be collected when due or at any
11 time thereafter;
12 (e) If, as of an installment due date, the payment date of all
13 wholly unpaid installments is deferred one or more full months and the
14 maturity of the contract is extended for a corresponding period, the
15 licensee may charge and collect a deferment charge not exceeding the
16 charge applicable to the first of the installments deferred, multiplied
17 by the number of months in the deferment period. The deferment period is
18 that period during which no payment is made or required by reason of such
19 deferment. The deferment charge may be collected at the time of deferment
20 or at any time thereafter. The portion of the precomputed charges
21 applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following the
22 deferment period shall remain the same as that applicable to such balance
23 and periods under the original loan contract. No installment on which a
24 default charge has been collected, or on account of which any partial
25 payment has been made, shall be deferred or included in the computation
26 of the deferment charge unless such default charge or partial payment is
27 refunded to the borrower or credited to the deferment charge. Any payment
28 received at the time of deferment may be applied first to the deferment
29 charge and the remainder, if any, applied to the unpaid balance of the
30 contract, except that if such payment is sufficient to pay, in addition
31 to the appropriate deferment charge, any installment which is in default

AM669 AM669
LB474 LB474
QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 and the applicable default charge, it shall be first so applied and any
2 such installment shall not be deferred or subject to the deferment
3 charge. If a loan is prepaid in full during the deferment period, the
4 borrower shall receive, in addition to the required rebate, a rebate of
5 that portion of the deferment charge applicable to any unexpired full
6 month or months of such deferment period; and
7 (f) If two or more full installments are in default for one full
8 month or more at any installment date and if the contract so provides,
9 the installment loan licensee may reduce the contract balance by the
10 rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of such
11 installment date and the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be
12 the unpaid principal balance and thereafter in lieu of charging,
13 collecting, receiving, and applying charges as provided in this
14 subsection, charges may be charged, collected, received, and applied at
15 the agreed rate as otherwise provided by this section until the loan is
16 fully paid.
17 (3) The charges, as referred to in subsection (1) of this section,
18 shall not be compounded. The charging, collecting, and receiving of
19 charges as provided in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed
20 compounding. If part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is
21 the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount
22 payable under such loan contract may include any unpaid charges on the
23 prior loan which have accrued within sixty days before the making of such
24 loan contract and may include the balance remaining after giving the
25 rebate required by subsection (2) of this section. Except as provided in
26 subsection (2) of this section, charges shall (a) be computed and paid
27 only as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal balance or
28 portions thereof and (b) be computed on the basis of the number of days

4 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section,
5 in addition to that provided for under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
6 Sales Act, no further or other amount whatsoever shall be directly or
7 indirectly charged, contracted for, or received. If any amount, in excess
8 of the charges permitted, is charged, contracted for, or received, the
9 loan contract shall not on that account be void, but the installment loan
10 licensee shall have no right to collect or receive any interest or other
11 charges whatsoever. If such interest or other charges have been collected
12 or contracted for, the licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest
13 and other charges collected and shall not collect any interest or other
14 charges contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as
15 liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if
16 found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto,
17 including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall
18 be found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of
19 the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a
20 bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
21 adopted to avoid any such error.
22 (5) A borrower may be required to pay all reasonable expenses
23 incurred in connection with the making, closing, disbursing, extending,
24 readjusting, or renewing of loans. Such expenses may include abstracting,

26 insurance; premiums paid on insurance policies covering tangible personal
27 property securing the loan; amounts charged for a debt cancellation
28 contract or a debt suspension contract, as agreed upon by the parties, if

12 amount equal to seven percent of that part of the original principal
13 balance of any loan not in excess of two thousand dollars and five
14 percent on that part of the original principal balance in excess of two
15 thousand dollars, if the installment loan licensee has not made another
16 loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months. If the licensee
17 has made another loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months,
18 a nonrefundable loan origination fee may only be charged on new funds
19 advanced on each successive loan. Such reasonable initial charges may be
20 collected from the borrower or included in the principal balance of the
21 loan at the time the loan is made and shall not be considered interest or
22 a charge for the use of the money loaned.
23 (6)(a) Loans secured solely by real property that are not made
24 pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property shall
25 not be subject to the limitations on the rate of interest provided in
26 subsection (1) of this section or the limitations on the nonrefundable
27 loan origination fee under subsection (5) of this section if (i) the
28 principal amount of the loan is seven thousand five hundred dollars or
29 more and (ii) the sum of the principal amount of the loan and the
30 balances of all other liens against the property do not exceed one

4 principal amount of the loan reduced by any portion of the principal that
5 consists of the amount required to pay off another loan made under this
6 subsection by the same licensee.
7 (c) A prepayment penalty on such loan shall be permitted only if (i)
8 the maximum amount of the penalty to be assessed is stated in writing at
9 the time the loan is made, (ii) the loan is prepaid in full within two
10 years from the date of the loan, and (iii) the loan is prepaid with money
11 other than the proceeds of another loan made by the same licensee. Such
12 prepayment penalty shall not exceed six months' interest on eighty
13 percent of the original principal balance computed at the agreed rate of
14 interest on the loan.
15 (d) An installment loan licensee making a loan pursuant to this
16 subsection may obtain an interest in any fixtures attached to such real
17 property and any insurance proceeds payable in connection with such real
18 property or the loan.
19 (e) For purposes of this subsection, principal amount of the loan
20 means the total sum owed by the borrower including, but not limited to,
21 insurance premiums, loan origination fees, or any other amount that is
22 financed, except that for purposes of subdivision (6)(b) of this section,
23 loan origination fees shall not be included in calculating the principal
24 amount of the loan.

29 45-101.04 or section 70 of this act upon any loan or upon any part or all

2 exempt the licensee from compliance with the Nebraska Installment Loan
3 and Sales Act.
4 (2)(a) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
5 subdivision (4) of section 45-101.04 are not subject to the Nebraska
6 Installment Loan and Sales Act if such loans are not made on real
7 property.
8 (b) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
9 subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property are not subject to
10 the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. An installment loan licensee
11 making such loans shall comply with and be subject to the Residential
12 Mortgage Licensing Act with respect to such loans, except that the
13 installment loan licensee shall not be required to obtain a mortgage
14 banker license under the Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
15 (c) Any mortgage loan originator who works as an employee or
16 independent agent of an installment loan licensee shall be required to
17 obtain a mortgage loan originator license and shall be subject to the
18 Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
19 (3) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(a) of section 70 of this
20 act, no installment loan licensee shall enter into any loan contract
21 under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act under which the
22 borrower agrees to make any payment of principal more than thirty-six
23 calendar months from the date of making such contract when the principal
24 balance is not more than three thousand dollars. Every loan contract
25 precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 70 of this act shall
26 provide for repayment of principal and charges in installments which
27 shall be payable at approximately equal periodic intervals of time and so
28 arranged that no installment is substantially greater in amount than any
29 preceding installment. When necessary in order to facilitate payment in
30 accordance with the borrower's principal source of income or when the
31 loan contract is not precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 70

1 of this act, the payment schedule may reduce or omit installment
2 payments. Any loan contract made in violation of this section, either
3 knowingly or without the exercise of due care to prevent the violation,
4 shall not on that account be void, but the licensee has no right to
5 collect or receive any interest or charges on such loan. If any interest
6 or other charges have been collected or contracted for, the installment
7 loan licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest and other charges
8 collected and shall not collect thereafter any interest or other charges
9 contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as liquidated
10 damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if found
11 liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto, including
12 reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall be found
13 liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of the
14 evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
15 fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
16 adopted to avoid any such error.
17 (1) Renewal of a license originally granted under the Nebraska
18 Installment Sales Act may be denied or a license may be suspended or
19 revoked by the director on the following grounds: (a) Material
20 misstatement in the application for license; (b) willful failure to
21 comply with any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act relating
22 to installment contracts; (c) defrauding any buyer to the buyer's damage;
23 or (d) fraudulent misrepresentation, circumvention, or concealment by the
24 licensee through whatever subterfuge or device of any of the material
25 particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to
26 the buyer under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
27 (2) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
28 association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the
29 suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or
30 trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a
31 licensed partnership or limited liability company has so acted or failed

5 shall give the licensee at least ten days' written notice, in the form of
6 an order to show cause, of the time and place of such hearing by either
7 registered or certified mail addressed to the principal place of business
8 in this state of such licensee. Such notice shall contain the grounds of
9 complaint against the licensee. Any order suspending or revoking such
10 license shall recite the grounds upon which the same is based. The order
11 shall be entered upon the records of the director and shall not be
12 effective until after thirty days' written notice thereof given after
13 such entry forwarded by either registered or certified mail to the
14 licensee at such principal place of business.
15 (4) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
16 of any license shall not impair or affect the obligation of any lawful
17 installment contract acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
18 (5) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
19 of any license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts
20 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
21 surrender or affect liability for any fines which may be levied against
22 the licensee or any of its officers, directors, shareholders, partners,
23 or members pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act for acts

25 surrender.
26 (6) Any person, licensee, or applicant considering himself or
27 herself aggrieved by an order of the director entered under the

7 (2) The borrower may waive the benefits of this section at any time
8 by giving consent if such consent is given at a time subsequent to the
9 date the debt arises.
10 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
11 business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in the business
12 of a sales finance company subject to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
13 The director shall have the power to appoint examiners who shall, under
14 his or her direction, investigate the installment contracts and business
15 and examine the books and records of licensees when the director shall so
16 determine. Such examinations shall not be conducted more often than
17 annually except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
18 (2) The director or his or her duly authorized representative shall
19 have the power to make such investigations as he or she shall deem
20 necessary, and to the extent necessary for this purpose, he or she may

23 documents.
24 (3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the

2 violation.
3 (5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing
4 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has
5 willfully and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska
6 Installment Sales Act, any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated
7 under the act, or any order issued by the director under the act, the
8 director may order such person to pay (a) an administrative fine of not

14 investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien
15 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
16 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil

23 costs shall constitute a separate violation of the Nebraska Installment
24 Sales Act.

7 worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general
8 reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or
9 expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of
10 serving as a factor in establishing the borrower's eligibility for credit
11 or insurance if such contacts are not designed to collect a delinquent
12 debt; or
13 (b) To locate the borrower when the licensee has reason to believe
14 the borrower has changed his or her employment or has moved from his or
15 her last-known address.
16 The director shall have the power to make such general rules and
17 regulations and specific rulings, demands, and findings as may be

21 Sec. 74. Section 45-353, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 45-353 (1) An agreement of the parties to a loan, with respect to

27 charges required by the agreement; or
28 (b) The prospect of payment, performance, or realization of
29 collateral is significantly impaired. The burden of establishing the
30 prospect of significant impairment is on the installment loan licensee.
31 (2) If the borrower has defaulted on his or her promise to pay and

2 certified mail, instructing the licensee to cease further contacts with
3 the borrower in regard to the indebtedness, the installment loan licensee
4 shall, after such notice, except as provided in section 45-352, limit
5 contacts to one notice per month by mail. No notice shall be designed to
6 threaten action not otherwise permitted by law.
7 (3) With respect to a loan, after a borrower has been in default for
8 ten days for failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
9 licensee may give the borrower the notice described in this section. An
10 installment loan licensee gives notice to the borrower under this section
11 when it delivers the notice to the borrower or delivers or mails the
12 notice to the last-known address of the borrower's residence.

23 borrower's failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
24 licensee may neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the
25 obligation nor take possession of collateral, except voluntarily
26 surrendered collateral, because of such default until twenty days after a
27 notice of the borrower's right to cure is given. The borrower shall have
28 twenty days after the notice is given to cure any default consisting of a
29 failure to make the required payment by tendering the amount of all
30 unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without acceleration, plus any
31 unpaid charges. Cure restores the borrower to his or her rights under the
-150-

AM669 AM669
LB474 LB474
QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025

4 to cure, the borrower shall have no further right to cure and the
5 installment loan licensee has no obligation to proceed against the
6 borrower or the collateral.
7 (7) Upon default by a borrower with respect to a loan, unless the
8 borrower voluntarily surrenders possession of the collateral to the
9 licensee, the licensee may take possession of the collateral without
10 judicial process only if possession can be taken without entry into a
11 dwelling or a locked, unoccupied motor vehicle, and without the use of
12 force or other breach of the peace.
13 (1) Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any
14 person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate any of the
15 provisions of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act, he or she may, in
16 addition to all actions provided for in the act and without prejudice
17 thereto, enter an order requiring such person to desist or to refrain
18 from such violation. An action may also be brought, on the relation of
19 the Attorney General or the director, to enjoin such person from engaging
20 in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in
21 furtherance thereof.
22 (2) In any such action an order or judgment may be entered awarding
23 such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition
24 to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining
25 order or injunction, the court, in which such action is brought, shall
26 have power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the
27 property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
28 documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court
29 may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska
30 Installment Sales Act through or by means of the use of such property and
31 business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, shall have such

5 2024, is amended to read:
6 45-354 (1) A borrower is not liable for a deficiency unless the
7 licensee has disposed of the collateral in good faith and in a
8 commercially reasonable manner.
9 (2) If the installment loan licensee takes possession or voluntarily
10 accepts surrender of goods in which the licensee has a security interest
11 to secure a loan and at the time thereof the unpaid balance due on the
12 loan is three thousand dollars or less, the borrower is not personally
13 liable to the installment loan licensee for the unpaid balance of the
14 debt arising from the loan and the licensee's duty to dispose of the
15 collateral is governed by the provisions on disposition of collateral,
16 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code.
17 (3) The borrower may be liable in damages to the installment loan
18 licensee if the borrower has wrongfully damaged the collateral or if,
19 after default, failure to cure, and demand, the borrower has wrongfully
20 failed to make the collateral available to the installment loan licensee.
21 (4) If the installment loan licensee elects to bring an action
22 against the borrower for a debt arising from a loan, when under this
23 section the installment loan licensee would not be entitled to a
24 deficiency judgment if the installment loan licensee took possession of
25 the collateral, and obtains judgment, (a) the installment loan licensee
26 may not take possession of the collateral and (b) the collateral is not
27 subject to levy or sale on execution or similar proceedings pursuant to
28 the judgment.

18 insurance procured by or through the licensee, which includes the amount
19 of any premium which the borrower has paid or is obligated to pay, the

7 any time or, if the account is not in default, in monthly installments or
8 fixed or determinable amounts as provided in the agreement; and
9 (e) The loan agreement expressly states that it covers preauthorized
10 loans. Preauthorized loan does not mean a transaction, resulting in
11 either a credit or a debit to the borrower's account, which is initiated
12 by the use or application of a plastic, metal, or other type of credit or
13 transaction card.
14 (2) For purposes of computations relating to preauthorized loans
15 made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, billing
16 cycle means the time interval between periodic billing dates. A billing
17 cycle shall be considered monthly if the closing date of the cycle is the
18 same date each month or does not vary by more than four days from such
19 date.

27 insurance or credit disability insurance provided in connection with the
28 preauthorized loan, subject to the requirements and restrictions
29 contained in section 83 of this act;
30 (b) Charges authorized by section 70 of this act or this section

QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 sections if such charges are computed in each billing cycle by any of the
2 following methods:
3 (i) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
4 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the daily unpaid
5 principal balance of the account, in which case each daily rate is
6 determined by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by twelve and
7 dividing by three hundred sixty-five;
8 (ii) By multiplying each graduated monthly rate by the applicable
9 portion of the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in
10 the billing cycle, in which case the average daily unpaid principal
11 balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided
12 by the number of days in the cycle; or
13 (iii) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
14 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the average
15 daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in
16 which case each daily rate is determined by multiplying the authorized
17 monthly rate by twelve and dividing by three hundred sixty-five, and the
18 average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid
19 each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in the cycle; and
20 (c) For each method of computation set forth in this section, the
21 billing cycle shall be monthly and the unpaid principal balance on any
22 day shall be determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the
23 beginning of that day all advances and other permissible amounts charged
24 to the borrower and deducting all payments and other credits made or
25 received that day.
26 (2) The borrower under a preauthorized loan may at any time pay all
27 or any part of the unpaid balance in his or her account, or, if the
28 account is not in default, the borrower may pay the unpaid principal
29 balance in monthly installments. Minimum monthly payment requirements
30 shall be determined by the licensee and set forth in the preauthorized
31 loan agreement, except that the minimum monthly payment shall not be less
-163-

2 balance of an account having an average daily balance of more than three
3 thousand dollars nor less than two percent of the average daily unpaid
4 principal balance of an account having an average daily balance of three
5 thousand dollars or less.
6 (3) A licensee may retain any security interest, including a
7 mortgage on real property, until the preauthorized account is terminated.
8 (4) Subsection (4) of section 45-345, subsection (3) of section
9 45-350, and section 78 of this act shall not apply to preauthorized
10 loans.
11 (5) The department may approve record-keeping systems for licensees
12 and may prescribe policies and procedures necessary to the administration
13 of preauthorized loans made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and
14 Sales Act.
15 Sec. 83. In addition to the charges permitted under section 82 of
16 this act, a licensee may contract for and receive the fees, costs, and
17 expenses permitted by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act on
18 other loans, subject to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in
19 the act with the following variations:
20 (1) If credit life or disability insurance is provided and if the
21 insured dies or becomes disabled when there is an outstanding
22 preauthorized loan indebtedness, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay
23 the total balance of the loan due on the date of the borrower's death or
24 the amount due as of the end of the previous billing cycle, whichever is
25 less, in the case of credit life insurance, or all minimum payments which
26 become due on the loan during the covered period of disability in the
27 case of credit disability insurance. The additional charge for credit
28 life insurance or credit disability insurance shall be calculated in each
29 billing cycle by applying the current monthly premium rate for such
30 insurance, as such rate may be determined by the Director of Insurance,
31 to the unpaid balances in the borrower's account, using either of the

2 charges;
3 (2) No credit life or disability insurance written in connection
4 with a preauthorized loan shall be canceled by the licensee because of

6 payments on the loan unless one or more of such payments is past due for
7 a period of ninety days or more, and the licensee shall advance to the
8 insurer the amounts required to keep the insurance in force during such
9 period, which amounts may be debited to the borrower's account;
10 (3) The department may, by rule and regulation or order, require a
11 statement of insurance that will be appropriate for preauthorized loans
12 in lieu of that required by section 80 of this act; and
13 (4) The amount, terms, and conditions of any insurance against loss
14 or damage to property must be reasonable in relation to the character and
15 value of the property insured and the maximum anticipated amount of
16 credit to be extended.
17 Sec. 84. (1) For purposes of this section, reverse-mortgage loan
18 means a loan made by a licensee which (a) is secured by residential real

23 no payment of principal or interest until the entire loan becomes due and
24 payable, and (e) otherwise complies with the terms of this section.

18 payment of the time-price differential on the contract if the buyer pays
19 the basic time price, cash price, or cash sale price within a certain
20 period of time, the seller shall, in clear and conspicuous writing,
21 either within the installment sales contract or in a separate document,
22 inform the buyer of the exact date by which the buyer must pay the basic
23 time price, cash price, or cash sale price in order to delay or cancel
24 the payment of the time-price differential. The seller or any subsequent
25 purchaser of the installment sales contract, including a sales finance
26 company, shall not be allowed to change such date.
27 (5) Upon written request from the buyer, the holder of an
28 installment sales contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written
29 statement of the dates and amounts of payments and the total amount
30 unpaid under such contract. A buyer shall be given a written receipt for
31 any payment when made in cash.

1 (6) After payment of all sums for which the buyer is obligated under
2 a contract, the holder shall deliver or mail to the buyer at his or her
3 last-known address one or more good and sufficient instruments or copies
4 thereof to acknowledge payment in full and shall release all security in
5 the goods and mark canceled and return to the buyer the original
6 agreement or copy thereof or instruments or copies thereof signed by the
7 buyer. For purposes of this section, a copy shall meet the requirements
8 of section 25-12,112.
9 Sec. 86. (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law,
10 the time-price differential for any goods or services sold under an
11 installment sales contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual
12 percentage rate and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to
13 exceed eighteen percent per annum, except that a minimum time-price
14 differential of ten dollars may be charged on any installment sales
15 contract.
16 (b) Origination fees may be required to be made by the buyer,
17 subject to the following requirements:
18 (i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the installment
19 sales contract, to pay an origination fee in an amount not to exceed ten
20 dollars, except that if the installment sales contract is for an
21 installment sale of agricultural machinery or equipment for use in
22 commercial agriculture or if the installment sales contract is for an
23 installment sale of industrial machinery or equipment, the buyer may be
24 required to pay (A) an origination fee of not to exceed one hundred
25 dollars if the cash sale price is less than twenty-five thousand dollars
26 or (B) an origination fee of not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars if
27 the cash sale price is twenty-five thousand dollars or more; and
28 (ii) The origination fee shall be refundable if the installment
29 sales contract is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination
30 fee may be collected from the buyer or included in the principal balance
31 of the installment sales contract at the time the contract is made and

1 shall not be considered interest or a time-price differential.
2 (c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act prohibits
3 a seller or holder of an installment sales contract from contracting for,
4 computing, and charging a time-price differential based upon the
5 application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the
6 number of days actually elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used
7 for the purpose of calculating the time-price differential, the time-
8 price balance, the amount of each installment, and the time-sale price.
9 (d) When the installment sales contract is payable in substantially
10 equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential
11 shall be computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined
12 under section 85 of this act, from the date of the contract until the due
13 date of the final installment, notwithstanding that the time-price
14 balance is required to be paid in installments.
15 (2) When an installment sales contract provides for payment other
16 than in substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the
17 time-price differential may be at a rate which will provide the same
18 return as is permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts
19 under subdivision (1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the
20 schedule of payments.
21 (3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide
22 for payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each
23 installment or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall
24 be determined.
25 Sec. 87. (1) The amount, if any, included for insurance, which may
26 be purchased by the holder of the contract, shall not exceed the
27 applicable premium rates chargeable in accordance with filings, if any,
28 with the Department of Insurance. If dual interest insurance on the goods
29 is purchased by the holder, it shall, within thirty days after execution
30 of the installment sales contract, send or cause to be sent to the buyer
31 a policy or policies or certificate of insurance, written by an insurance
-170-

1 company authorized to do business in this state, clearly setting forth
2 the amount of the premium, the kind or kinds of insurance, the coverages,
3 and all the terms and conditions of the contract or contracts of
4 insurance.
5 (2) If any insurance is canceled or the premium adjusted during the
6 term of the installment sales contract, any refund of the insurance
7 premium plus the unearned time-price differential thereon received by the
8 holder shall be credited by the holder to the last maturing installment
9 of the contract except to the extent applied toward payment for similar
10 insurance protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder or either
11 of them.
12 (3) If any insurance is canceled due to the payment of all sums for
13 which the buyer is liable under an installment sales contract, the holder
14 of the installment sales contract shall, upon receipt of payment of all
15 sums due, send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days of the
16 name, address, and telephone number of the insurance company which issued
17 the insurance contract or the party responsible for any refund, and
18 notice that the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice
19 shall be retained by the holder of the installment sales contract. This
20 subsection does not apply if the holder of the loan contract previously
21 credited the refund of the insurance premium to the loan contract or
22 otherwise refunded the insurance premium to the buyer.
23 (4) The holder may also purchase nonfiling insurance and charge a
24 reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges
25 prescribed by law which would have been paid to public officials for
26 filing, perfecting, releasing, and satisfying any lien or security
27 interest in the goods or services.
28 Sec. 88. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the
29 contrary, any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the
30 obligation of any contract.
31 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
-171-

LB474 LB474
QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
2 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
3 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
4 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
5 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
6 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
7 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
8 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
9 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
10 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
11 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
12 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
13 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
14 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
15 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
16 date judgment is obtained.
17 Sec. 89. (1) Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods
18 or services from a seller from whom such buyer has previously purchased
19 goods or services under one or more installment sales contracts and the
20 amounts under such contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price
21 thereof have not been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may be
22 included in and consolidated with one or more of the prior contract or
23 contracts. A memorandum of such additional purchases shall be prepared by
24 the seller and inserted in or attached to the seller's counterpart of the
25 contract and shall set forth:
26 (a) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the
27 additional goods or services sold and all the information with respect to
28 the additional purchase required by section 85 of this act to be included
29 in an installment sales contract;
30 (b) The consolidated time-price balance to be paid by the buyer; and
31 (c) The revised payments.
-172-

QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 (2) A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as
2 provided in and subject to section 85 of this act. When such subsequent
3 purchases are made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such
4 subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied on previous
5 purchases.
6 (3) Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment sales
7 contract shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases
8 in the same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the
9 various purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred
10 payment is increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the
11 subsequent payments, at the seller's option, may be deemed to be
12 allocated as follows: An amount equal to the original installment payment
13 to the previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The
14 amount of any initial payment or downpayment on the subsequent purchase
15 shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase. This
16 section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or other
17 merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or to
18 repairs or services in connection therewith rendered by the seller at the
19 buyer's request.
20 Sec. 90. (1) An installment sales contract may provide and the
21 holder thereof may collect, in addition to any time-price differential, a
22 delinquency charge on each installment in default for a period of not
23 less than fifteen days, if provided for in the contract, not in excess of
24 five percent of each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is
25 less, or, in lieu thereof, interest after maturity on each such
26 installment not exceeding the highest permissible contract rate. If the
27 time-price differential is computed by application of the rate charged to
28 the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually elapsed,
29 such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent of each installment
30 or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any installment payment is
31 made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is not honored
-173-

AM669 AM669
LB474 LB474
QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 because of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason except an
2 error of a third party to the contract, the holder may charge and collect
3 a fee of not more than fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such
4 fee may be collected when due or at any time thereafter.
5 (2) When an installment sales contract is for a commercial or
6 business purpose (a) a delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of
7 each unpaid installment may be contracted for and received and (b) the
8 holder of any check or draft or similar order which is not honored for
9 any reason, except for error of a third party, may charge and collect a
10 fee as stated in the contract. As used in this section, commercial or
11 business purpose means primarily for a purpose other than a personal,
12 family, or household purpose.
13 Sec. 91. The holder of a retail installment sales contract may,
14 upon agreement with the buyer:
15 (1) Extend the scheduled due date or defer the scheduled payment of
16 any installment payment under the retail installment sales contract; and
17 (2) Charge and collect a reasonable flat service fee for such
18 extension or deferment in addition to the time-price differential
19 calculated for the period of such extension or deferment at the rate
20 originally agreed upon in the retail installment sales contract on the
21 outstanding balance.
22 Sec. 92. (1) If any seller or sales finance company, in the making
23 or collection of an installment sales contract, shall, directly or
24 indirectly, contract for, take, or receive charges in excess of those
25 authorized by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act except as a
26 result of an accidental and bona fide error, such contract shall be void
27 and uncollectible as to (a) all of the excessive portion of the time-
28 price differential, (b) the first one thousand dollars of the time-price
29 differential authorized by section 86 of this act, and (c) the first four
30 thousand dollars of the principal of the contract.
31 (2) If any seller or sales finance company violates any provision of
-174-

QNC - 03/24/2025 QNC - 03/24/2025
1 the act, other than the violations described in subsection (1) of this
2 section, except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error, such
3 installment sales contract shall be void and uncollectible as to the
4 first five hundred dollars of the time-price differential and the first
5 one thousand dollars of the principal of such contract. If any of such
6 money has been paid by the buyer, such buyer or his or her assignee may
7 recover under the act in a civil suit brought within one year after the
8 due date, or any extension thereof, of the last installment of the
9 contract.
10 Sec. 93. (1) A licensee shall not refuse to enter into a loan or
11 impose finance charges or other terms or conditions of credit more
12 onerous than those regularly extended by that licensee to borrowers of
13 similar economic backgrounds because of the age, color, creed, national
14 origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sex, marital status, or
15 disability of the borrower or because the borrower receives public
16 assistance, social security benefits, pension benefits, or the like.
17 (2) No licensee shall conduct the business of making loans under the
18 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act within any office, room, or place
19 of business in which any other business is solicited or engaged in, or in
20 association or conjunction with any other business, if the director finds
21 that the other business is of such nature that the conducting of such
22 other business tends to conceal evasion of the act or of the rules and
23 regulations adopted and promulgated under the act. In such case, the
24 director shall order such licensee in writing to cease and desist from
25 such conduct.
26 (3) No licensee shall, directly or indirectly, require a borrower as
27 a condition of granting a loan to such borrower to reaffirm or otherwise
28 obligate the borrower to pay a former debt to the licensee which has been
29 discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
30 (4) Any person who makes a false statement to secure a loan is
31 guilty of a Class III misdemeanor. The punishment shall not be exacted,

2 falsity of the statement.
3 (5) No licensee or other person subject to the Nebraska Installment
4 Loan and Sales Act shall advertise, print, display, publish, distribute,

7 misleading, or deceptive statement or representation with regard to the
8 rates, terms, or conditions for the lending of money, credit, goods, or
9 things in action. The director may order any licensee to cease and desist
10 from any conduct which he or she finds to be a violation of this section.
11 The director may require that rates of charge, if stated by a licensee,
12 be stated fully and clearly in such manner as the director deems
13 necessary to prevent misunderstanding by prospective borrowers.
14 (6) No loan, made outside this state, in the amount or of the value
15 of three thousand dollars or less, for which a greater rate of interest,
16 consideration, or charges than is permitted by section 45-350 has been
17 charged, contracted for, or received, shall be enforced in this state.
18 Every person participating in such loan in this state is subject to the
19 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, except that the act shall not
20 apply to loans legally made in any state under and in accordance with a
21 regulatory small loan law similar in principle to such act.

5 pursuant to this section in which the licensee is found liable, the court
6 shall award costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the borrower. A
7 licensee is not liable under this section if the licensee notifies the
8 borrower of an error before the licensee receives from the borrower
9 written notice of the error or before the borrower has brought an action
10 under this section and the licensee corrects the error within thirty days
11 after notifying the borrower. A licensee may not be held liable in any
12 action brought under this section if the licensee shows by a
13 preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and
