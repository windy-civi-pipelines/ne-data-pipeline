loan and, except as otherwise provided in this section, ample security by
mortgage or deeds of trust on real estate. For purposes of this section, real
property and real estate shall include a leasehold or subleasehold estate in
real property under a lease or sublease the term of which does not expire, or
which is renewable automatically or at the option of the holder or of the
association so as not to expire for at least five years beyond the maturity of
the debt. Loans made upon improved real estate, except as otherwise provided in
this section, shall not exceed ninety-five percent of the reasonable normal
cash value thereof, and all loans made on any other real estate shall not
exceed three-fourths of the reasonable normal cash value thereof.
(2) An association may make a loan or loans in an amount exceeding ninety-
five percent of the reasonable normal cash value of the real estate security
(a) if such loan or loans are made to a veteran in accord with the provisions
of 38 U.S.C., as now existing or as hereafter amended, (b) if the proceeds of
the loan or loans are to be used in purchasing residential property or in
constructing a dwelling on unimproved property owned by such veteran to be
occupied as his or her home, used for the purpose of making repairs,
alterations, or improvements in or paying delinquent indebtedness, taxes, or
special assessments on residential property owned by the veteran and used by
him or her as his or her home, or used in purchasing any land and buildings to
be used by the applicant in pursuing a gainful occupation other than farming,
-1-

2025 2025
and (c) if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs guarantees that portion of such
loan or loans in excess of ninety-five percent of the reasonable normal cash
value of the real estate security.
(3) An association is authorized to obtain insurance of its loans by the
Federal Housing Administrator under Title II of the National Housing Act, as
amended, and such loans so made upon improved real estate and so insured shall
not be subject to the restrictions set forth in this section with reference to
the maximum authorized amount of a loan.
(4) An association may make unsecured loans to its members if such loans
(a) are insured under Title I and Title II of the National Housing Act, as
amended, or (b) are for property alterations, repair, or improvements. The
aggregate amount of loans made under subdivisions (a) and (b) of this
subsection shall not at any time exceed twenty percent of the association's
assets. Each loan made under subdivision (b) of this subsection shall be
repayable in regular monthly installments within a period of twenty years and
shall be supported by a written property statement on forms to be prescribed by
the Department of Banking and Finance. An association may make secured loans to
its members and may make loans under 38 U.S.C., as amended, under Chapter V,
subchapter C of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended (12 U.S.C.), and
on the security of mobile homes.
(5) The stock of such association may be accepted as security for a loan
of the amount of the withdrawal value of such stock without other security.
(6) An association when so licensed may make loans to its own members upon
the terms and security set forth in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act.
(7) Any provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, an
association may make any loan that a federal savings and loan association doing
business in this state is or may be authorized to make.
(8) An association may invest in loans, obligations, and advances of
credit, all of which are referred to in this subsection as loans, made for the
payment of expenses of business school, technical training school, college, or
university education, but no association shall make any investment in loans
under this subsection if the principal amount of its investment in such loans,
exclusive of any investment which is or which at the time of its making was
otherwise authorized, would thereupon exceed five percent of its assets. Such
loans may be secured, partly secured, or unsecured, and the association may
require a comaker or comakers, insurance, guaranty under a governmental student
loan guarantee plan, or other protection against contingencies. The borrower
shall certify to the association that the proceeds of the loan are to be used
by a full-time student solely for the payment of expenses of business,
technical training school, college, or university education.
(9) An association may participate with other lenders in making loans of
any type that an association may otherwise make if (a) each of the lenders is
either an instrumentality of the United States Government or is insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or, in the case of another lender, the
interest of the association in such loan is superior to the participating
interests of the other participants and (b) an association whose accounts are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which may be a federal
association or an association chartered by this state, or another association
chartered by this state which is not so insured, has otherwise complied with
subsection (1) of this section with respect to loans to members.
(10) An association may sell to or purchase from any institution which is
a savings association chartered by this state or the accounts of which are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation a participating interest

Sec. 2. Section 8-330, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended to

expenses may include abstract, recording, and registration fees, title
examinations, survey, escrow services, and taxes or charges imposed upon or in
connection with the making and recording of any mortgage. Such reasonable
charges may be collected by the association from the borrower and shall not be
considered interest or a charge for the use of the money loaned. A charge not
exceeding one percent or that allowed a federally chartered association for the
premature prepayment may be made. The rate of interest on any loan of money
shall be determined and computed upon the assumption that the debt will be paid
according to the agreed terms and in the event the loan is paid or collected by
court action prior to the term of the loan, any payment charged, received, or
taken as an advance or forbearance which is in the nature of and taken into
account in the calculation of interest, shall be spread over the stated term of
the loan for the purpose of determining the rate of interest. Any amounts paid
or contracted to be paid by persons other than the borrower shall not be
considered interest and shall not be taken into account in the calculation of
interest. Interest may be paid on escrow accounts held for the payment of
taxes, insurance, and similar payments, if agreed to in writing by the borrower
and association. Loans may be made by an association under a license granted it
pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, to borrowing members
whose loans are secured by real estate, to the same extent and in the same
amount as such loans may lawfully be made to nonborrowing members. The
association shall furnish a loan settlement statement to each borrower,
-2-

indicating in detail the charges and fees such borrower has paid or obligated
himself or herself to pay to the association or to any other person in
connection with such loan. A copy of such statement shall be retained in the
records of the association.
An association may charge and receive interest, on property improvement

amended, and unsecured loans authorized in section 5(c) of the Home Owners'
Loan Act, as amended.

Sec. 5. Section 8-820.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
8-820.01 It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the State of
Nebraska that for purposes of applying the federal most-favored-lender
doctrine, the bank credit card rate contained in section 8-820 is not
comparable or analogous to the small loan rate found in section 70 of this act

Section 5:
sections 45-1024 and section 45-350 45-1025. The Legislature finds that the
institutions making small loans and the institutions administering a bank
credit card are categorically different. The transactions carried on by these
institutions are categorically different. The Legislature finds that small loan
borrowers and bank credit card users are not synonymous or comparable. In
establishing a small loan rate, the Legislature has recognized a risk factor
that is different and greater than other financial transactions and therefor
justifies the charging of a higher interest rate than installment loans,
personal loans, retail revolving credit plans, or bank credit card interest
rates.

permitted to receive the interest or dividends on such deposit.

to the pledging of such securities shall be paid by the licensee. All such
securities shall be subject to sale and transfer and to the disposal of the
proceeds by the director only on the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.
(6) The surety bond shall remain in effect until cancellation, which may
occur only after thirty days' written notice to the director. Cancellation
shall not affect any liability incurred or accrued during the period the surety
bond was in effect.

the licensee ceases money transmission in this state, except that the director
may permit the surety bond to be reduced or eliminated before that time to the
extent that the amount of the licensee's payment instruments outstanding in
this state are reduced. The director may also permit a licensee to substitute a
letter of credit or such other form of security acceptable to the director for
the surety bond in place at the time the licensee ceases money transmission in
the state.

examination and inspection concerning the propriety of the issuance of a
license to any applicant. The cost of such examination and inspection shall be
borne by the applicant.
(5) If all requirements to obtain a license under the Nebraska Installment
Loan and Sales Act are met and a finding can be made that the experience,
character, and general fitness of the applicant, of the members thereof if the
applicant is a corporation or association, and of the officers and directors
thereof if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to warrant belief that
the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently within the
purpose of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, the director shall
issue and deliver a license to the applicant to do business in accordance with
the license and the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. The director shall

sends the initial notice to correct the deficiency or deficiencies, the
department may deem the application as abandoned and may issue a notice of
abandonment of the application to the applicant in lieu of proceedings to deny

(10) Obtaining a license constitutes sufficient contact with this state
for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the licensee in any action

the buyer is liable under an installment contract, the holder of the
installment contract shall, upon receipt of payment of all sums due, send
notice to the buyer within fifteen business days of the name, address, and
telephone number of the insurance company which issued the insurance contract

loan contract or otherwise refunded the insurance premium to the buyer.
(4) The holder may also purchase nonfiling insurance and charge a
reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges

(b) A person who holds one or more installment loan licenses pursuant to
the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act and a mortgage banker license

Section 21:
section 45-724; and

the licensee requiring the licensee to increase the surety bond within thirty
days to the amount required by subsection (2) or (3) of this section.
(5) The bond or a substitute bond required by subsection (1) of this

Section 22:
section, applicable to all licensees under the Nebraska Installment Loan and

conducting licensable activity. If a licensee fails to maintain a surety bond
as required under this section, the department may issue a notice of
cancellation of the license in lieu of revocation proceedings.
(1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the time-price
differential for any goods or services sold under an installment contract shall
be stated as a fixed or variable annual percentage rate and shall be at a rate
agreed to in writing, not to exceed eighteen percent per annum, except that a
minimum time-price differential of ten dollars may be charged on any
installment contract.
(b)(i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the installment
contract, to pay an origination fee of not to exceed ten dollars, except that
if the installment contract is for an installment sale of agricultural
machinery or equipment for use in commercial agriculture or if the installment

is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination fee may be collected

at the time the contract is made and shall not be considered interest or a
time-price differential.
(c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act prohibits a seller or
holder of an installment contract from contracting for, computing, and charging
a time-price differential based upon the application of the rate charged to the
unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually elapsed. The charges
so computed shall be used for the purpose of calculating the time-price
differential, the time-price balance, the amount of each installment, and the
time-sale price.
(d) When the installment contract is payable in substantially equal and
consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential shall be computed
on the basic time price of each contract, as determined under the provisions of

Section 23:
section 45-336, from the date of the contract until the due date of the final
installment, notwithstanding that the time-price balance is required to be paid
in installments.
(2) When an installment contract provides for payment other than in
substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price
differential may be at a rate which will provide the same return as is
permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts under subdivision
(1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the schedule of payments.
(3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide for
payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each installment

Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods or services from a
seller from whom he has previously purchased goods or services under one or
more installment contracts and the amounts under such contract or contracts to
the extent of cash sale price thereof have not been fully paid the subsequent
purchases may be included in and consolidated with one or more of the prior
contract or contracts. A memorandum of such additional purchases shall be
prepared by the seller and inserted in or attached to the seller's counterpart
of the contract and shall set forth:

(3) The revised payments.
A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as provided in
and subject to the provisions of section 45-336. When such subsequent purchases
are made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such subsequent
purchases shall be deemed to have been applied on previous purchases.
Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment contract shall
be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases in the same ratio or
proportion as the original cash sale prices of the various purchases bear to
one another. Where the amount of each deferred payment is increased in
connection with such subsequent purchase, the subsequent payments, at the
seller's option, may be deemed to be allocated as follows: An amount equal to
the original installment payment to the previous purchase, the balance to the
subsequent purchase. The amount of any initial payment or downpayment on the
subsequent purchase shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent
purchase. The provisions of this section shall not apply to cases involving
equipment, parts, or to other merchandise attached or affixed to goods
previously purchased, or to repairs or services in connection therewith
rendered by the seller at the buyer's request.

of the director entered under this section may appeal the order. The appeal
shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
Installment contracts negotiated and entered into by mail without personal
solicitation by salespersons or other representatives of the seller and based
upon the catalog of the seller or other printed solicitation of business, which
is distributed and made available generally to the public, if such catalog or
other printed solicitation clearly sets forth the cash and time-sale prices and
other terms of sales to be made through such medium, may be made as provided in

(d) The licensee has knowingly provided or caused to be provided to the
director any false or fraudulent representation of a material fact or any false

license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts committed before
the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender or affect
liability for any fines which may be levied against the licensee or any of the
licensee's officers, directors, shareholders, partners, or members pursuant to
the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act for acts committed before the
revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender of the license.
(7) Whenever, for any cause, a license is revoked, the department shall
not issue another license to the licensee unless the department is otherwise
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so.
(8) At the request of the licensee or any other aggrieved person, the
department shall prepare a written record which includes a transcript of the
evidence, the findings with respect to the evidence, the order, and the reasons
supporting the suspension, revocation, or denial of a license, and shall, after
being paid for the cost of the written record, deliver to the licensee or other
aggrieved person a copy of the written record in person or by certified or
registered mail.
(9) Any person, licensee, or applicant potentially aggrieved by an order
of the director entered under this section may appeal the order. The appeal
shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
An installment contract may provide and the holder thereof may collect, in
addition to any time-price differential, a delinquency charge on each
installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen days, if provided
for in the contract, not in excess of five percent of each installment or
twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu thereof, interest after
maturity on each such installment not exceeding the highest permissible
contract rate. If the time-price differential is computed by application of the
rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually
elapsed, such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent of each
installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any installment
payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is not honored
because of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason except an error
of a third party to the contract, the holder may charge and collect a fee of
not more than fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such fee may be
collected when due or at any time thereafter.
When an installment contract is for a commercial or business purpose (1) a
delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of each unpaid installment may be
contracted for and received and (2) the holder of any check or draft or similar
order which is not honored for any reason, except for error of a third party,
may charge and collect a fee as stated in the contract. As used in this

Section 25:
section, commercial or business purpose means primarily for a purpose other
than a personal, family, or household purpose.
Sec. 63. Section 45-342, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-342 Any person who, by any device, subterfuge, or pretense whatsoever,
engages in or continues any of the kinds of business or enterprise permitted to
licensees by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act without having
obtained the license required by the act, with intent to evade the provisions
of the act, is guilty of a Class I misdemeanor.
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary, any
buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the obligation of any
contract.
(2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall receive a
rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount obtained by
applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or, if
deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according to the
actuarial method, the rate of the time-price differential previously stated to
the borrower. The licensee may round the rate of the time-price differential to
the nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently used
to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and
deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less than one
dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the contract shall not in
itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained before the final installment
date, the contract balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be
required for prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained.
Sec. 64. Section 45-343, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-343 A licensee may move its main office or may relocate a branch office
from one location to another without obtaining a new license if the licensee
gives notice thereof to the director through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing
System and Registry at least thirty days prior to such move and pays a filing
fee of one hundred fifty dollars. The director may, at the director's
discretion, hold a hearing on the relocation request, in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure Act. The expense of any such hearing shall be paid by
the licensee.
Any person who violates any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales
Act or acts as a sales finance company in this state without a license therefor
as provided in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act shall be guilty of a Class II
misdemeanor.
Sec. 65. Section 45-344, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:

-45-

control of any licensee under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act
without first (a) giving thirty days' notice to the department on a form
prescribed by the department of such proposed acquisition and (b) paying a
filing fee of one hundred fifty dollars and any processing fee allowed under
subsection (2) of section 94 of this act.
(2) The director, upon receipt of such notice, shall approve or deny the
acquisition within thirty days.
(3) If the director does not deny the acquisition within such thirty-day
time period, the acquisition shall become effective on the thirty-first day
after the receipt of the notice, except that the director may extend the
thirty-day period an additional thirty days if, in the director's judgment, any
material information submitted is substantially inaccurate or the acquiring
party has not furnished all the information required by the department.
(4) An acquisition may become effective prior to the expiration of the
thirty-day period if the director issues written notice of the director's
approval of such acquisition or the director's intent not to deny the
acquisition.
(5)(a) The director may deny any proposed acquisition if:
(i) The financial condition of any acquiring person is such as might
jeopardize the financial stability of the acquired licensee;
(ii) The character and general fitness of any acquiring person or of any
of the proposed management personnel indicate that the acquired installment
sales licensee or installment loan licensee would not be operated honestly,
fairly, or efficiently within the purposes of the Nebraska Installment Loan and
Sales Act; or
(iii) Any acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish all
information required by the department.
(b) The director shall notify the acquiring party in writing of denial of
the acquisition. The notice shall provide a statement of the basis for the
denial.
(c) Within fifteen business days after receipt of written notice of
denial, the acquiring party may make a written request for a hearing on the
proposed acquisition in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and
rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department under the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. The director shall, by order, approve
or deny the proposed acquisition on the basis of the record made at the
hearing.
If any seller or sales finance company, in the making or collection of an
installment contract, shall, directly or indirectly, contract for, take, or
receive charges in excess of those authorized by the Nebraska Installment Sales
Act except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error such contract shall
be void and uncollectible as to (1) all of the excessive portion of the time-
price differential, (2) the first one thousand dollars of the time-price
differential authorized by section 45-338, and (3) the first four thousand
dollars of the principal of the contract. If any seller or sales finance
company violates any provision of the act, other than the violations described
above, except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error, such
installment contract shall be void and uncollectible as to the first five
hundred dollars of the time-price differential and the first one thousand
dollars of the principal of such contract. If any of such money has been paid
by the buyer, such buyer or his or her assignee may recover under the act in a
civil suit brought within one year after the due date, or any extension
thereof, of the last installment of the contract.
Sec. 66. Section 45-345, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:

as designation.
(2)(a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this subsection,
a licensee shall notify the director in writing or through the Nationwide
Mortgage Licensing System and Registry within three business days from the time
that the licensee becomes aware of any breach of the security of the system of

information about a Nebraska resident, or the unauthorized access to or use of
such information about a Nebraska resident as a result of the breach.
(b) If a licensee would be required under Nebraska law to provide
notification to a Nebraska resident regarding such incident, then the licensee
shall provide a copy of such notification to the department prior to or
simultaneously with the licensee's notification to the Nebraska resident.
(c) Notice required by this subsection may be delayed if a law enforcement
agency determines that the notice will impede a criminal investigation. Notice
shall be made in good faith, without unreasonable delay, and as soon as
possible after the law enforcement agency determines that notification will no
longer impede the investigation.
(d) For purposes of this subsection, the terms breach of the security of
the system and personal information have the same meaning as in section 87-802.
(3) A licensee shall maintain the minimum net worth required by section
45-337 while a license issued to the licensee under the Nebraska Installment
Loan and Sales Act is in effect. The minimum net worth shall be proven by an
annual audit conducted by a certified public accountant. A licensee shall
submit a copy of the annual audit to the director as required by section 45-337
or upon written request of the director. If a licensee fails to maintain the
-46-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
required minimum net worth, the department may issue a notice of cancellation
of the license in lieu of revocation proceedings.
(4)(a) Every licensee shall, at the time any loan is made, give to the
borrower, or if there are two or more borrowers, to one of the borrowers, a
statement in the English language disclosing in clear and distinct terms the
information required to be disclosed under the federal Consumer Credit
Protection Act.
(b) The licensee shall also give to the borrower a copy of any writing
evidencing a loan if the writing requires or provides for the signature of the
borrower. The writing evidencing the borrower's obligation to pay a loan shall
contain a clear and conspicuous notice in form and content substantially as
follows:
NOTICE TO CONSUMER: 1. Do not sign this paper before you read it. 2. You
are entitled to a copy of this paper. 3. You may prepay the unpaid balance at
any time without penalty and may be entitled to receive a refund of unearned
charges in accordance with law.
(5) All licensees under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act shall,
on or before March 1 of each year, file with the department a report of the
licensee's earnings and operations for the preceding calendar year, the
licensee's assets at the end of the year, and any other relevant information as
the department may reasonably require. The report shall be made under oath and
shall be in the form and manner prescribed by the department.
(6) All installment loan licensees shall submit a mortgage report of
condition as required by section 45-726 on or before a date or dates
established by rule, regulation, or order of the director.
(7) Upon written request of a borrower, the licensee shall provide a
written statement of the dates and amounts of payments made and the amounts of
any default and deferment charges assessed preceding the month in which the
request is received and the total amount unpaid as of the end of the period
covered by the statement and a copy of the loan agreement and security
agreement, and a facsimile of any insurance certificate issued as part of the
transaction, if applicable. The licensee may charge a reasonable fee for such
copies, not to exceed fifty cents per page.
(8) A licensee shall answer in writing, within ten business days after
receipt, any written request for payoff information from a borrower or a
borrower's representative. This service shall be provided without charge to the
borrower, except that when such information is provided upon request within
sixty days after the fulfillment of a previous request, a processing fee of up
to ten dollars may be charged for the subsequent request.
(1) No person shall act as a sales finance company in this state without
obtaining a license therefor from the department as provided in the Nebraska
Installment Sales Act whether or not such person maintains an office, place of
doing business, or agent in this state, unless such person meets the
requirements of section 45-340.
(2) No financial institution or installment loan licensee authorized to do
business in this state shall be required to obtain a license under the act but
shall comply with all of the other provisions of the act.
(3) A seller who does not otherwise act as a sales finance company shall
not be required to obtain a license under the act but shall comply with all of
the other provisions of the act in order to charge the time-price differential
allowed by section 45-338.
Sec. 67. Section 45-346, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
45-346 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in business
activities requiring a license under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act. The department may examine or investigate complaints about or reports of
alleged violations by a licensee made to the department. The director shall
have the power to appoint examiners who shall, under the director's direction,
investigate the installment sales contracts, installment loans, and business
and examine the books and records of licensees when the director shall so
determine. Such examinations shall be conducted as often as determined by the
director.
(2) The director or the director's duly authorized representative shall
have the power to make such investigations as the director or authorized
representative shall deem necessary, and to the extent necessary for this
purpose, the director or authorized representative may examine a licensee or
any other person and shall have the power to compel the production of all
relevant books, records, accounts, and documents.
(3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the books
and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set forth in

Section 26:
sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of an investigation
of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs shall be paid within
thirty days after receipt of billing.
(4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or inquiry
request for information from the department, the licensee shall respond within
twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to respond as required by
this subsection shall constitute a separate violation.
(5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has willfully
and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska Installment Loan and
Sales Act, any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated under the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act, or any order issued by the director under the
-47-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, the director may order such person to
pay (a) an administrative fine of not more than five thousand dollars for each
separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation. The department shall
remit fines collected under this subsection to the State Treasurer for
distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the Constitution of
Nebraska.
(6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien in the
amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of
such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the
director. The lien shall attach to the real property of such person when notice
of the lien is filed and indexed against the real property in the office of the
register of deeds in the county where the real property is located. The lien
shall attach to any other property of such person when notice of the lien is
filed against the property in the manner prescribed by law. Failure of the
person to pay such fine and costs shall constitute a separate violation of the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act.
(1) A license issued under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act is
nontransferable and nonassignable. The same person may obtain additional
licenses for each place of business operating as a sales finance company in
this state upon compliance with the act as to each license, except that on or
after January 1, 2020, a person is no longer required to obtain a new license
for each place of business and may maintain a branch office or offices upon
compliance with the act.
(2) Application for a license shall be on a form prescribed and furnished
by the director and shall include, but not be limited to, (a) the applicant's
name and any trade name or doing business as designation which the applicant
intends to use in this state, (b) the applicant's main office address, (c) all
branch office addresses at which business is to be conducted, (d) the names and
titles of each director and principal officer of the applicant, (e) the names
of all shareholders, partners, or members of the applicant, (f) a description
of the activities of the applicant in such detail as the department may
require, (g) if the applicant is an individual, his or her social security
number, (h) audited financial statements showing a minimum net worth of one
hundred thousand dollars, and (i) background checks as provided in section
45-354.
(3) An applicant for a license shall file with the department a surety
bond in the amount of fifty thousand dollars, furnished by a surety company
authorized to do business in this state. Such bond shall be increased by an
additional fifty thousand dollars for each branch location of the applicant
that is licensed under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act. The bond shall be
for the use of the State of Nebraska and any Nebraska resident who may have
claims or causes of action against the applicant. The surety may cancel the
bond only upon thirty days' written notice to the director.
(4) A license fee of one hundred fifty dollars, and, if applicable, a one-
hundred-dollar fee for each branch office listed in the application, and any
processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 shall be
submitted along with each application.
(5) An initial license shall remain in full force and effect until the
next succeeding December 31. Each license shall remain in force until revoked,
suspended, canceled, expired, or surrendered.
(6) The director shall, after an application has been filed for a license
under the act, investigate the facts, and if he or she finds that the
experience, character, and general fitness of the applicant, of the members
thereof if the applicant is a corporation or association, and of the officers
and directors thereof if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to warrant
belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently
within the purpose of the act, the director shall issue and deliver a license
to the applicant to do business as a sales finance company in accordance with
the license and the act. The director shall have the power to reject for cause
any application for a license.
(7) The director shall, within his or her discretion, make an examination
and inspection concerning the propriety of the issuance of a license to any
applicant. The cost of such examination and inspection shall be borne by the
applicant.
(8) If an applicant for a license under the act does not complete the
license application and fails to respond to a notice or notices from the
department to correct the deficiency or deficiencies for a period of one
hundred twenty days or more after the date the department sends the initial
notice to correct the deficiency or deficiencies, the department may deem the
application as abandoned and may issue a notice of abandonment of the
application to the applicant in lieu of proceedings to deny the application.
Sec. 68. Section 45-347, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-347 The payment in money, credit, goods, or things in action, as
consideration for any sale or assignment of, or order for, the payment of
wages, salary, commission, or other compensation for services, whether earned
or to be earned, shall, for purposes of regulation under the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act, be deemed a loan secured by such assignment,
and the amount by which the assigned compensation exceeds the amount of the
consideration actually paid, shall, for the purposes of regulation under the
act, be deemed interest or charges upon the loan from the date of payment to
the date the compensation is payable. Such transaction shall be governed by and
-48-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
be subject to the act.
All money collected under the authority of the Nebraska Installment Sales
Act shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the Financial
Institution Assessment Cash Fund.
Sec. 69. Section 45-348, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-348 Every installment loan licensee shall permit payment to be made in
advance in any amount equal to one or more full installments on any loan
contract at any time during regular business hours, but the licensee may apply
such payment first to all accrued charges in full up to the date of such
payment.
(1) An installment sales license may be renewed annually on or before
December 31 by paying to the director a fee of one hundred fifty dollars, plus
one hundred dollars for each branch office, if applicable, and any processing
fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 and by submitting such
information as the director may require to indicate any material change in the
information contained in the original application or succeeding renewal
applications, including a copy of the licensee's most recent annual audit.
(2) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license at any time by
delivering to the director written notice of the surrender. The department
shall cancel the license following such surrender.
(3) If a licensee fails to renew its license and does not voluntarily
surrender the license pursuant to this section, the department may issue a
notice of expiration of the license to the licensee in lieu of revocation
proceedings.
Sec. 70. (1) Except as provided in section 45-350 and subsection (6) of
this section, every installment loan licensee may make loans and may contract
for and receive on such loans charges at a rate not exceeding twenty-four
percent per annum on that part of the unpaid principal balance on any loan not
in excess of one thousand dollars, and twenty-one percent per annum on any
remainder of such unpaid principal balance. Except for loans secured by mobile
homes, an installment loan licensee may not make loans for a period in excess
of one hundred forty-five months if the amount of the loan is greater than
three thousand dollars but less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Unless
otherwise allowed for by law, charges on loans made under the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act shall not be paid, deducted, or received in
advance. The contracting for, charging of, or receiving of charges as provided
for in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed to be the payment,
deduction, or receipt of such charges in advance.
(2) When the loan contract requires repayment in substantially equal and
consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined, the
installment loan licensee may, at the time the loan is made, precompute the
charges at the agreed rate on scheduled unpaid principal balances according to
the terms of the contract and add such charges to the principal of the loan.
Every payment may be applied to the combined total of principal and precomputed
charges until the contract is fully paid. All payments made on account of any
loan except for default and deferment charges shall be deemed to be applied to
the unpaid installments in the order in which the unpaid installments are due.
The portion of the precomputed charges applicable to any particular month of
the contract, as originally scheduled or following a deferment, shall be that
proportion of such precomputed charges, excluding any adjustment made for a
first installment period of more than one month and any adjustment made for
deferment, which the balance of the contract scheduled to be outstanding during
such month bears to the sum of all monthly balances originally scheduled to be
outstanding by the contract. This section shall not limit or restrict the
manner of calculating charges, whether by way of add-on, single annual rate, or
otherwise, if the rate of charges does not exceed what is permitted by this

Section 27:
section. Charges may be contracted for and earned at a single annual rate,
except that the total charges from such rate shall not be greater than the
total charges from the several rates otherwise applicable to the different
portions of the unpaid balance according to subsection (1) of this section. All
loan contracts made pursuant to this subsection are subject to the following
adjustments:
(a) Notwithstanding the requirement for substantially equal and
consecutive monthly installments, the first installment period may not exceed
one month by more than twenty-one days and may not fall short of one month by
more than eleven days. The charges for each day exceeding one month shall be
one-thirtieth of the charges which would be applicable to a first installment
period of one month. The charge for extra days in the first installment period
may be added to the first installment and such charges for such extra days
shall be excluded in computing any rebate;
(b) If prepayment in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise occurs before
the first installment due date, the charges shall be recomputed at the rate of
charges contracted for in accordance with this section upon the actual unpaid
principal balance of the loan for the actual time outstanding by applying the
payment, or payments, first to charges at the agreed rate and the remainder to
the principal. The amount of charges so computed shall be retained in lieu of
all precomputed charges;
(c) If a contract is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise
after the first installment due date, the borrower shall receive a rebate of an
amount which is not less than the amount obtained by applying to the unpaid
principal balances as originally scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for
the period following prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of
-49-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
charge contracted for in accordance with this section. The licensee may round
the rate of charge to the nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is
not consistently used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be
permitted. Any default and deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be
deducted from any rebate. No rebate shall be required for any partial
prepayment. No rebate of less than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the
maturity of the contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is
obtained before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be
reduced by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
date judgment is obtained;
(d) If any installment on a precomputed or interest-bearing loan is unpaid
in full for ten or more consecutive days, Sundays and holidays included, after
it is due, the licensee may charge and collect a default charge not exceeding
an amount equal to five percent of such installment. If any installment payment
is made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is not honored because
of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason except an error of a
third party to the loan contract, the licensee may charge and collect a
fifteen-dollar bad check charge. Such default or bad check charges may be
collected when due or at any time thereafter;
(e) If, as of an installment due date, the payment date of all wholly
unpaid installments is deferred one or more full months and the maturity of the
contract is extended for a corresponding period, the licensee may charge and
collect a deferment charge not exceeding the charge applicable to the first of
the installments deferred, multiplied by the number of months in the deferment
period. The deferment period is that period during which no payment is made or
required by reason of such deferment. The deferment charge may be collected at
the time of deferment or at any time thereafter. The portion of the precomputed
charges applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following
the deferment period shall remain the same as that applicable to such balance
and periods under the original loan contract. No installment on which a default
charge has been collected, or on account of which any partial payment has been
made, shall be deferred or included in the computation of the deferment charge
unless such default charge or partial payment is refunded to the borrower or
credited to the deferment charge. Any payment received at the time of deferment
may be applied first to the deferment charge and the remainder, if any, applied
to the unpaid balance of the contract, except that if such payment is
sufficient to pay, in addition to the appropriate deferment charge, any
installment which is in default and the applicable default charge, it shall be
first so applied and any such installment shall not be deferred or subject to
the deferment charge. If a loan is prepaid in full during the deferment period,
the borrower shall receive, in addition to the required rebate, a rebate of
that portion of the deferment charge applicable to any unexpired full month or
months of such deferment period; and
(f) If two or more full installments are in default for one full month or
more at any installment date and if the contract so provides, the installment
loan licensee may reduce the contract balance by the rebate which would be
required for prepayment in full as of such installment date and the amount
remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be the unpaid principal balance and
thereafter in lieu of charging, collecting, receiving, and applying charges as
provided in this subsection, charges may be charged, collected, received, and
applied at the agreed rate as otherwise provided by this section until the loan
is fully paid.
(3) The charges, as referred to in subsection (1) of this section, shall
not be compounded. The charging, collecting, and receiving of charges as
provided in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed compounding. If
part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is the unpaid principal
balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount payable under such loan
contract may include any unpaid charges on the prior loan which have accrued
within sixty days before the making of such loan contract and may include the
balance remaining after giving the rebate required by subsection (2) of this

Section 28:
section. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, charges shall
(a) be computed and paid only as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal
balance or portions thereof and (b) be computed on the basis of the number of
days actually elapsed. For purposes of computing charges, whether at the
maximum rate or less, a month shall be that period of time from any date in a
month to the corresponding date in the next month but if there is no such
corresponding date then to the last day of the next month, and a day shall be
considered one-thirtieth of a month when computation is made for a fraction of
a month.
(4) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, in
addition to that provided for under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act, no further or other amount whatsoever shall be directly or indirectly
charged, contracted for, or received. If any amount, in excess of the charges
permitted, is charged, contracted for, or received, the loan contract shall not
on that account be void, but the installment loan licensee shall have no right
to collect or receive any interest or other charges whatsoever. If such
interest or other charges have been collected or contracted for, the licensee
shall refund to the borrower all interest and other charges collected and shall
not collect any interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter due on
the loan involved, as liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or
its assignee, if found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating
thereto, including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee
shall be found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of
-50-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to
avoid any such error.
(5) A borrower may be required to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with the making, closing, disbursing, extending, readjusting, or
renewing of loans. Such expenses may include abstracting, recording, releasing,
and registration fees; premiums paid for nonfiling insurance; premiums paid on
insurance policies covering tangible personal property securing the loan;
amounts charged for a debt cancellation contract or a debt suspension contract,
as agreed upon by the parties, if the debt cancellation contract or debt
suspension contract is a contract of a financial institution or installment
loan licensee and such contract is sold directly by such financial institution
or licensee or by an unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent of such financial
institution or licensee in accordance with 12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part
existed on January 1, 2025, and the financial institution or installment loan
licensee is responsible for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent's compliance
with such part; title examinations; credit reports; survey; taxes or charges
imposed upon or in connection with the making and recording or releasing of any
mortgage; amounts charged for a guaranteed asset protection waiver; and fees
and expenses charged for electronic title and lien services. Except as provided
in subsection (6) of this section, a borrower may also be required to pay a
nonrefundable loan origination fee not to exceed the lesser of five hundred
dollars or an amount equal to seven percent of that part of the original
principal balance of any loan not in excess of two thousand dollars and five
percent on that part of the original principal balance in excess of two
thousand dollars, if the installment loan licensee has not made another loan to
the borrower within the previous twelve months. If the licensee has made
another loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months, a nonrefundable
loan origination fee may only be charged on new funds advanced on each
successive loan. Such reasonable initial charges may be collected from the
borrower or included in the principal balance of the loan at the time the loan
is made and shall not be considered interest or a charge for the use of the
money loaned.
(6)(a) Loans secured solely by real property that are not made pursuant to
subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property shall not be subject to
the limitations on the rate of interest provided in subsection (1) of this

Section 29:
section or the limitations on the nonrefundable loan origination fee under
subsection (5) of this section if (i) the principal amount of the loan is seven
thousand five hundred dollars or more and (ii) the sum of the principal amount
of the loan and the balances of all other liens against the property do not
exceed one hundred percent of the appraised value of the property. Acceptable
methods of determining appraised value shall be made by the department pursuant
to rule, regulation, or order.
(b) An origination fee on such loan shall be computed only on the
principal amount of the loan reduced by any portion of the principal that
consists of the amount required to pay off another loan made under this
subsection by the same licensee.
(c) A prepayment penalty on such loan shall be permitted only if (i) the
maximum amount of the penalty to be assessed is stated in writing at the time
the loan is made, (ii) the loan is prepaid in full within two years from the
date of the loan, and (iii) the loan is prepaid with money other than the
proceeds of another loan made by the same licensee. Such prepayment penalty
shall not exceed six months' interest on eighty percent of the original
principal balance computed at the agreed rate of interest on the loan.
(d) An installment loan licensee making a loan pursuant to this subsection
may obtain an interest in any fixtures attached to such real property and any
insurance proceeds payable in connection with such real property or the loan.
(e) For purposes of this subsection, principal amount of the loan means
the total sum owed by the borrower including, but not limited to, insurance
premiums, loan origination fees, or any other amount that is financed, except
that for purposes of subdivision (6)(b) of this section, loan origination fees
shall not be included in calculating the principal amount of the loan.
Sec. 71. Section 45-350, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-350 (1) Installment loan licensees may charge, contract for, or receive
any amount or rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.03 or 45-101.04 or

Section 30:
section 70 of this act upon any loan or upon any part or all of any aggregate
indebtedness of the same person. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this

Section 31:
section, the charging, contracting for, or receiving of a rate of interest
permitted by section 45-101.04 does not exempt the licensee from compliance
with the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act.
(2)(a) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to subdivision
(4) of section 45-101.04 are not subject to the Nebraska Installment Loan and
Sales Act if such loans are not made on real property.
(b) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to subdivision
(11) of section 45-101.04 on real property are not subject to the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act. An installment loan licensee making such loans
shall comply with and be subject to the Residential Mortgage Licensing Act with
respect to such loans, except that the installment loan licensee shall not be
required to obtain a mortgage banker license under the Residential Mortgage
Licensing Act.
(c) Any mortgage loan originator who works as an employee or independent
agent of an installment loan licensee shall be required to obtain a mortgage
-51-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
loan originator license and shall be subject to the Residential Mortgage
Licensing Act.
(3) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(a) of section 70 of this act, no
installment loan licensee shall enter into any loan contract under the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act under which the borrower agrees to make any
payment of principal more than thirty-six calendar months from the date of
making such contract when the principal balance is not more than three thousand
dollars. Every loan contract precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section
70 of this act shall provide for repayment of principal and charges in
installments which shall be payable at approximately equal periodic intervals
of time and so arranged that no installment is substantially greater in amount
than any preceding installment. When necessary in order to facilitate payment
in accordance with the borrower's principal source of income or when the loan
contract is not precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 70 of this
act, the payment schedule may reduce or omit installment payments. Any loan
contract made in violation of this section, either knowingly or without the
exercise of due care to prevent the violation, shall not on that account be
void, but the licensee has no right to collect or receive any interest or
charges on such loan. If any interest or other charges have been collected or
contracted for, the installment loan licensee shall refund to the borrower all
interest and other charges collected and shall not collect thereafter any
interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter due on the loan
involved, as liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or its
assignee, if found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto,
including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall be
found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of the
evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide
error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid
any such error.
(1) Renewal of a license originally granted under the Nebraska Installment
Sales Act may be denied or a license may be suspended or revoked by the
director on the following grounds: (a) Material misstatement in the application
for license; (b) willful failure to comply with any provision of the Nebraska
Installment Sales Act relating to installment contracts; (c) defrauding any
buyer to the buyer's damage; or (d) fraudulent misrepresentation,
circumvention, or concealment by the licensee through whatever subterfuge or
device of any of the material particulars or the nature thereof required to be
stated or furnished to the buyer under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
(2) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or
revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed
association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership or limited
liability company has so acted or failed to act as would be cause for
suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.
(3) No license shall be denied, suspended, or revoked except after hearing
in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The director shall give
the licensee at least ten days' written notice, in the form of an order to show
cause, of the time and place of such hearing by either registered or certified
mail addressed to the principal place of business in this state of such
licensee. Such notice shall contain the grounds of complaint against the
licensee. Any order suspending or revoking such license shall recite the
grounds upon which the same is based. The order shall be entered upon the
records of the director and shall not be effective until after thirty days'
written notice thereof given after such entry forwarded by either registered or
certified mail to the licensee at such principal place of business.
(4) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender of any
license shall not impair or affect the obligation of any lawful installment
contract acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
(5) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender of any
license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts committed before
the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender or affect
liability for any fines which may be levied against the licensee or any of its
officers, directors, shareholders, partners, or members pursuant to the
Nebraska Installment Sales Act for acts committed before the revocation,
suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender.
(6) Any person, licensee, or applicant considering himself or herself
aggrieved by an order of the director entered under the provisions of this

Section 32:
section may appeal the order. The appeal shall be in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure Act.
Sec. 72. Section 45-351, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-351 (1) Except as otherwise provided by the Nebraska Installment Loan
and Sales Act or other law, an installment loan licensee shall not contact any
individual who is not living, residing, or present in the household of the
borrower regarding the borrower's obligation to pay a debt, other than the
borrower's spouse, the borrower's attorney, another creditor, or a credit
reporting agency.
(2) The borrower may waive the benefits of this section at any time by
giving consent if such consent is given at a time subsequent to the date the
debt arises.
(1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in the business of a
sales finance company subject to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act. The
-52-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
director shall have the power to appoint examiners who shall, under his or her
direction, investigate the installment contracts and business and examine the
books and records of licensees when the director shall so determine. Such
examinations shall not be conducted more often than annually except as provided
in subsection (2) of this section.
(2) The director or his or her duly authorized representative shall have
the power to make such investigations as he or she shall deem necessary, and to
the extent necessary for this purpose, he or she may examine such licensee or
any other person and shall have the power to compel the production of all
relevant books, records, accounts, and documents.
(3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the books
and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set forth in

Section 33:
sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of an investigation
of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs shall be paid within
thirty days after receipt of billing.
(4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or inquiry
request for information from the department, the licensee shall respond within
twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to respond as required by
this subsection shall constitute a separate violation.
(5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has willfully
and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act,
any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated under the act, or any order
issued by the director under the act, the director may order such person to pay
(a) an administrative fine of not more than one thousand dollars for each
separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation. The department shall
remit fines collected under this subsection to the State Treasurer for
distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the Constitution of
Nebraska.
(6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien in the
amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of
such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the
director. The lien shall attach to the real property of such person when notice
of the lien is filed and indexed against the real property in the office of the
register of deeds in the county where the real property is located. The lien
shall attach to any other property of such person when notice of the lien is
filed against the property in the manner prescribed by law. Failure of the
person to pay such fine and costs shall constitute a separate violation of the
Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
Sec. 73. Section 45-352, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-352 (1) Section 45-351 shall not prohibit the licensee from:
(a) Contacting any person in order to discover property belonging to the
borrower that may be seized to satisfy a debt that has been reduced to
judgment;
(b) Making amicable demand and filing suit on the debt; or
(c) Contacting persons related to the borrower if permission is
specifically given in writing at the time the debt arises or at any time after
such debt arises.
(2) An installment loan licensee may contact any person without the
borrower's consent:
(a) To ascertain information relating to a borrower's credit worthiness,
credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal
characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or
collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in
establishing the borrower's eligibility for credit or insurance if such
contacts are not designed to collect a delinquent debt; or
(b) To locate the borrower when the licensee has reason to believe the
borrower has changed his or her employment or has moved from his or her last-
known address.
The director shall have the power to make such general rules and
regulations and specific rulings, demands, and findings as may be necessary for
the proper conduct of the business licensed under the Nebraska Installment
Sales Act, and the enforcement of the act, in addition thereto and not
inconsistent therewith.
Sec. 74. Section 45-353, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-353 (1) An agreement of the parties to a loan, with respect to default
on the part of the borrower, is enforceable only to the extent that:
(a) The borrower fails to make a payment on the loan or other charges
required by the agreement; or
(b) The prospect of payment, performance, or realization of collateral is
significantly impaired. The burden of establishing the prospect of significant
impairment is on the installment loan licensee.
(2) If the borrower has defaulted on his or her promise to pay and if he
or she has given specific notice in writing, by registered or certified mail,
instructing the licensee to cease further contacts with the borrower in regard
to the indebtedness, the installment loan licensee shall, after such notice,
except as provided in section 45-352, limit contacts to one notice per month by
mail. No notice shall be designed to threaten action not otherwise permitted by
law.
(3) With respect to a loan, after a borrower has been in default for ten
-53-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
days for failure to make a required payment, an installment loan licensee may
give the borrower the notice described in this section. An installment loan
licensee gives notice to the borrower under this section when it delivers the
notice to the borrower or delivers or mails the notice to the last-known
address of the borrower's residence.
(4) The notice shall be in writing and shall conspicuously state:
(a) The name, address, and telephone number of the installment loan
licensee to which payment is to be made;
(b) A brief identification of the loan;
(c) The borrower's right to cure the default;
(d) The amount of payment and date by which payment must be made to cure
the default; and
(e) That any credit insurance issued in connection with the loan contract
may be canceled unless the borrower cures the default.
(5) With respect to a loan, after a default consisting only of the
borrower's failure to make a required payment, an installment loan licensee may
neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the obligation nor take
possession of collateral, except voluntarily surrendered collateral, because of
such default until twenty days after a notice of the borrower's right to cure
is given. The borrower shall have twenty days after the notice is given to cure
any default consisting of a failure to make the required payment by tendering
the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without
acceleration, plus any unpaid charges. Cure restores the borrower to his or her
rights under the agreement as though the default had not occurred.
(6) With respect to defaults on the same obligation after an installment
loan licensee has once given a notice of the borrower's right to cure, the
borrower shall have no further right to cure and the installment loan licensee
has no obligation to proceed against the borrower or the collateral.
(7) Upon default by a borrower with respect to a loan, unless the borrower
voluntarily surrenders possession of the collateral to the licensee, the
licensee may take possession of the collateral without judicial process only if
possession can be taken without entry into a dwelling or a locked, unoccupied
motor vehicle, and without the use of force or other breach of the peace.
(1) Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any person
is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate any of the provisions
of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act, he or she may, in addition to all
actions provided for in the act and without prejudice thereto, enter an order
requiring such person to desist or to refrain from such violation. An action
may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney General or the director,
to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from
doing any act or acts in furtherance thereof.
(2) In any such action an order or judgment may be entered awarding such
preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition to all
other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining order or
injunction, the court, in which such action is brought, shall have power and
jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the property and business of
the defendant, including books, papers, documents, and records pertaining
thereto or so much thereof as the court may deem reasonably necessary to
prevent violations of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act through or by means of
the use of such property and business. Such receiver, when so appointed and
qualified, shall have such powers and duties as to custody, collection,
administration, winding up and liquidation of such property and business as
shall, from time to time, be conferred upon him or her by the court.
Sec. 75. Section 45-354, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
45-354 (1) A borrower is not liable for a deficiency unless the licensee
has disposed of the collateral in good faith and in a commercially reasonable
manner.
(2) If the installment loan licensee takes possession or voluntarily
accepts surrender of goods in which the licensee has a security interest to
secure a loan and at the time thereof the unpaid balance due on the loan is
three thousand dollars or less, the borrower is not personally liable to the
installment loan licensee for the unpaid balance of the debt arising from the
loan and the licensee's duty to dispose of the collateral is governed by the
provisions on disposition of collateral, article 9, Uniform Commercial Code.
(3) The borrower may be liable in damages to the installment loan licensee
if the borrower has wrongfully damaged the collateral or if, after default,
failure to cure, and demand, the borrower has wrongfully failed to make the
collateral available to the installment loan licensee.
(4) If the installment loan licensee elects to bring an action against the
borrower for a debt arising from a loan, when under this section the
installment loan licensee would not be entitled to a deficiency judgment if the
installment loan licensee took possession of the collateral, and obtains
judgment, (a) the installment loan licensee may not take possession of the
collateral and (b) the collateral is not subject to levy or sale on execution
or similar proceedings pursuant to the judgment.
(1) Effective January 1, 2013, or within one hundred eighty days after the
Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry is capable of accepting
licenses issued under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act, whichever is later,
the department shall require such licensees under the act to be licensed and
registered through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. In
order to carry out this requirement, the department is authorized to
participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. For this
-54-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
purpose, the department may establish, by adopting and promulgating rules and
regulations or by order, requirements as necessary. The requirements may
include, but not be limited to:

Act, the department is authorized to establish relationships or contracts with
the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry or other entities
designated by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to collect
and maintain records and process transaction fees or other fees related to
licensees or other persons subject to the act. The department may allow such
system to collect licensing fees on behalf of the department and allow such
system to collect a processing fee for the services of the system directly from
each licensee or applicant for a license.
(3) The director is required to regularly report enforcement actions and
other relevant information to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and
Registry subject to the provisions contained in section 45-355.
(4) The director shall establish a process whereby applicants and
licensees may challenge information entered into the Nationwide Mortgage
Licensing System and Registry by the director.
(5) The department shall ensure that the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing
System and Registry adopts a privacy, data security, and breach of security of
the system notification policy. The director shall make available upon written
request a copy of the contract between the department and the Nationwide
Mortgage Licensing System and Registry pertaining to the breach of security of
the system provisions.
(6) The department shall upon written request provide the most recently
available audited financial report of the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System
and Registry.
(7) The director may use the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and
Registry as a channeling agent for requesting information from and distributing

governmental agency in order to reduce the points of contact which the Federal
Bureau of Investigation may have to maintain for purposes of subsection (1) of
this section.
Sec. 76. Section 45-355, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-355 (1) No individual, other than the spouse of the borrower, is
obligated as a cosigner, comaker, guarantor, endorser, surety, or similar party
with respect to a loan unless, before or contemporaneously with signing any
separate agreement of loan or any writing setting forth the terms of the
borrower's agreement, the individual receives a separate written notice that

and reasonably informs the individual of the obligation with respect to it.
(2) Such notice shall be in the form prescribed by the department.
(3) An individual entitled to notice under this section shall also be
given a copy of any writing setting forth the terms of the borrower's agreement
and of any separate agreement of obligation signed by the individual entitled
to the notice.
(1) In order to promote more effective regulation and reduce the
regulatory burden through supervisory information sharing:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements under
any federal or state law regarding the privacy or confidentiality of any
information or material provided to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System
and Registry, and any privilege arising under federal or state law, including
the rules of any federal or state court, with respect to such information or
material, shall continue to apply to such information or material after the

System and Registry. Such information and material may be shared with all
federal and state regulatory officials with mortgage industry oversight
authority without the loss of privilege or the loss of confidentiality
protections provided by federal or state law;

the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry with respect to such
information or material, the person to whom such information or material
pertains waives, in whole or in part, in the discretion of such person, that
privilege;
(c) Any state statute relating to the disclosure of confidential
supervisory information or any information or material described in subdivision
(a) of this subsection that is inconsistent with such subdivision shall be

as established by adopting and promulgating rules and regulations or an order
of the director.

proposed acquisition within such period of time, the acquisition shall become
effective on the thirty-first day after receipt without the director's
approval, except that the director may extend the thirty-day period an
additional thirty days if, in his or her judgment, any material information
submitted is substantially inaccurate or the acquiring party has not furnished
all the information required by the department.
(3) An acquisition may become effective prior to the expiration of the
disapproval period if the director issues written notice of his or her intent

a copy shall meet the requirements of section 25-12,112.
Sec. 79. Nothing in sections 45-351 and 45-353 shall limit a borrower's

certificate of authority requirements under the Motor Club Services Act.
(3) Notwithstanding section 70 of this act and section 45-350, any gain or
advantage, in the form of commission or otherwise, to the licensee or to any
employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee from such insurance or motor
club service or the sale thereof shall not be deemed to be an additional or
further charge in connection with the loan contract. The insurance premium or
motor club service contract fee may be collected from the borrower or financed
through the loan contract at the time the loan is made.
(4)(a) Insurance permitted under this section shall be obtained through a
duly licensed insurance agent, agency, or broker. Premiums shall not exceed
those fixed by law or current applicable manual rates. Insurance written, as
authorized by this section, may contain a mortgage clause or other appropriate
provision to protect the insurable interest of the licensee.
(b) Motor club services permitted under this section shall be obtained
through a motor club which holds a certificate of authority under the Motor
Club Services Act.
(5) In the event of a renewal of a loan contract, any insurance or motor
club service sold pursuant to this section shall be canceled and (a) a refund
of the unearned premium or motor club service contract fee credited or made
before new insurance or motor club service of the same type as that being
canceled may be rewritten or (b) the holder of the loan contract shall send
notice to the buyer within fifteen business days after cancellation of the
name, address, and telephone number of the insurance company or motor club
which issued the insurance contract or motor club service contract or the party
responsible for any refund and notice that the buyer may be eligible for a
refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of the loan
contract.
(6) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this section
is canceled or the premium or motor club service contract fee adjusted during
the term of the loan contract, any refund of the insurance premium or motor
club service contract fee plus the unearned interest thereon received by the
holder shall be credited by the holder to the loan contract or otherwise
refunded, except to the extent applied toward payment for similar insurance or
motor club service protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder or
either of them.
(7) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this section
is canceled due to the payment of all sums for which the buyer is liable under
a loan contract, the holder of the loan contract shall, upon receipt of payment
of all sums due, send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days after
payment of the sums due of the name, address, and telephone number of the
insurance company or motor club which issued the insurance contract or motor
club service contract or the party responsible for any refund and notice that
the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained
by the holder of the loan contract. This subsection does not apply if the
holder of the loan contract previously credited the refund of the insurance
premium or motor club service contract fee to the loan contract or otherwise
refunded the insurance premium or motor club service contract fee to the buyer.
(8) The licensee shall, at the time the loan is made, give to the
borrower, or if more than one, to one of them, a statement concerning any
insurance procured by or through the licensee, which includes the amount of any
premium which the borrower has paid or is obligated to pay, the expiration date
of the policy, and a concise description of the risks insured. If a borrower
-57-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
procures insurance by or through a licensee, the licensee shall deliver to the
borrower within fifteen days after the making of the loan an executed copy of
the insurance policy or certificate of insurance.
Sec. 81. (1) Licensees holding an active installment loan license may
make preauthorized loans. Preauthorized loan means a loan made by a licensee
pursuant to an agreement between the licensee and the borrower whereby:
(a) The licensee may permit the borrower to obtain advances of money from
the licensee from time to time or the licensee may advance money on behalf of
the borrower from time to time as directed by the borrower;
(b) The amount of each advance and permitted charge and cost is debited to
the borrower's account and payments and other credits are credited to the same
account;
(c) The charges are computed on the unpaid principal balance or balances
of the account from time to time;
(d) The borrower has the privilege of paying the account in full at any
time or, if the account is not in default, in monthly installments or fixed or
determinable amounts as provided in the agreement; and
(e) The loan agreement expressly states that it covers preauthorized
loans. Preauthorized loan does not mean a transaction, resulting in either a
credit or a debit to the borrower's account, which is initiated by the use or
application of a plastic, metal, or other type of credit or transaction card.
(2) For purposes of computations relating to preauthorized loans made
pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, billing cycle means
the time interval between periodic billing dates. A billing cycle shall be
considered monthly if the closing date of the cycle is the same date each month
or does not vary by more than four days from such date.
Sec. 82. (1) A licensee may make preauthorized loans and may contract for
and receive charges on such loans as set forth in subsection (1) of section 70
of this act, subject to the following requirements:
(a) A licensee shall not compound charges by adding any unpaid charges
authorized by section 70 of this act or this section to the unpaid principal
balance of the borrower's account, except that the unpaid principal balance may
include additional charges for credit life insurance or credit disability
insurance provided in connection with the preauthorized loan, subject to the
requirements and restrictions contained in section 83 of this act;
(b) Charges authorized by section 70 of this act or this section shall be
deemed not to exceed the maximum charges permitted by such sections if such
charges are computed in each billing cycle by any of the following methods:
(i) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the daily unpaid
principal balance of the account, in which case each daily rate is determined
by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by twelve and dividing by three
hundred sixty-five;
(ii) By multiplying each graduated monthly rate by the applicable portion
of the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing
cycle, in which case the average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of
the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in
the cycle; or
(iii) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the average daily
unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in which case
each daily rate is determined by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by
twelve and dividing by three hundred sixty-five, and the average daily unpaid
principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle
divided by the number of days in the cycle; and
(c) For each method of computation set forth in this section, the billing
cycle shall be monthly and the unpaid principal balance on any day shall be
determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the beginning of that day all
advances and other permissible amounts charged to the borrower and deducting
all payments and other credits made or received that day.
(2) The borrower under a preauthorized loan may at any time pay all or any
part of the unpaid balance in his or her account, or, if the account is not in
default, the borrower may pay the unpaid principal balance in monthly
installments. Minimum monthly payment requirements shall be determined by the
licensee and set forth in the preauthorized loan agreement, except that the
minimum monthly payment shall not be less than one and one-half percent of the
average daily unpaid principal balance of an account having an average daily
balance of more than three thousand dollars nor less than two percent of the
average daily unpaid principal balance of an account having an average daily
balance of three thousand dollars or less.
(3) A licensee may retain any security interest, including a mortgage on
real property, until the preauthorized account is terminated.
(4) Subsection (4) of section 45-345, subsection (3) of section 45-350,
and section 78 of this act shall not apply to preauthorized loans.
(5) The department may approve record-keeping systems for licensees and
may prescribe policies and procedures necessary to the administration of
preauthorized loans made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act.
Sec. 83. In addition to the charges permitted under section 82 of this
act, a licensee may contract for and receive the fees, costs, and expenses
permitted by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act on other loans,
subject to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in the act with the
following variations:
-58-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
(1) If credit life or disability insurance is provided and if the insured
dies or becomes disabled when there is an outstanding preauthorized loan
indebtedness, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay the total balance of the
loan due on the date of the borrower's death or the amount due as of the end of
the previous billing cycle, whichever is less, in the case of credit life
insurance, or all minimum payments which become due on the loan during the
covered period of disability in the case of credit disability insurance. The
additional charge for credit life insurance or credit disability insurance
shall be calculated in each billing cycle by applying the current monthly
premium rate for such insurance, as such rate may be determined by the Director
of Insurance, to the unpaid balances in the borrower's account, using either of
the methods specified in section 82 of this act for the calculation of loan
charges;
(2) No credit life or disability insurance written in connection with a
preauthorized loan shall be canceled by the licensee because of delinquency of
the borrower in the making of the required minimum payments on the loan unless
one or more of such payments is past due for a period of ninety days or more,
and the licensee shall advance to the insurer the amounts required to keep the
insurance in force during such period, which amounts may be debited to the
borrower's account;
(3) The department may, by rule and regulation or order, require a
statement of insurance that will be appropriate for preauthorized loans in lieu
of that required by section 80 of this act; and
(4) The amount, terms, and conditions of any insurance against loss or
damage to property must be reasonable in relation to the character and value of
the property insured and the maximum anticipated amount of credit to be
extended.
Sec. 84. (1) For purposes of this section, reverse-mortgage loan means a
loan made by a licensee which (a) is secured by residential real estate, (b) is
nonrecourse to the borrower except in the event of fraud by the borrower or
waste to the residential real estate given as security for the loan, (c)
provides cash advances to the borrower based upon the equity in the borrower's
owner-occupied principal residence, (d) requires no payment of principal or
interest until the entire loan becomes due and payable, and (e) otherwise
complies with the terms of this section.
(2) Reverse-mortgage loans shall be governed by the following rules
without regard to the requirements set out elsewhere for other types of
mortgage transactions: (a) Payment in whole or in part is permitted without
penalty at any time during the period of the loan; (b) an advance and interest
on the advance have priority over a lien filed after the closing of a reverse-
mortgage loan; (c) an interest rate may be fixed or adjustable and may also
provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the value of the
residential real estate; and (d) the advance shall not be reduced in amount or
number based on an adjustment in the interest rate when a reverse-mortgage loan
provides for periodic advances to a borrower.
(3) Reverse-mortgage loans may be made or acquired without regard to the
following provisions for other types of mortgage transactions: (a) Limitations
on the purpose and use of future advances or any other mortgage proceeds; (b)
limitations on future advances to a term of years or limitations on the term of
credit line advances; (c) limitations on the term during which future advances
take priority over intervening advances; (d) requirements that a maximum
mortgage amount be stated in the mortgage; (e) limitations on loan-to-value
ratios; (f) prohibitions on balloon payments; (g) prohibitions on compounded
interest and interest on interest; and (h) requirements that a percentage of
the loan proceeds must be advanced prior to loan assignment.
(4) A licensee may, in connection with a reverse-mortgage loan, charge to
the borrower (a) a nonrefundable loan origination fee which does not exceed two
percent of the appraised value of the owner-occupied principal residence at the
time the loan is made, (b) a reasonable fee paid to third parties originating
loans on behalf of the licensee, and (c) such other fees as are necessary and
required, including fees for inspections, insurance, appraisals, and surveys.
(5) Licensees failing to make loan advances as required in the loan
documents and failing to cure the default as required in the loan documents
shall forfeit an amount equal to the greater of two hundred dollars or one
percent of the amount of the loan advance the licensee failed to make.
Sec. 85. (1) Each retail installment sales contract shall be in writing,
shall be signed by both the buyer and the seller, and shall contain the
following items, and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the buyer at the time
the instrument is signed, except for contracts made in conformance with
subdivision (5)(c) of section 45-336:
(a) The cash sale price;
(b) The amount of the buyer's downpayment, and whether made in money or
goods, or partly in money and partly in goods, including a brief description of
any goods traded in;
(c) The difference between subdivisions (a) and (b) of this subsection;
(d) The amount included for insurance if a separate charge is made
therefor, specifying the types of coverages;
(e) The amount included for a debt cancellation contract or a debt
suspension contract if the debt cancellation contract or debt suspension
contract is a contract of a financial institution or licensee, such contract is
sold directly by such financial institution or licensee or by an unaffiliated,
nonexclusive agent of such financial institution or licensee in accordance with
12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part existed on January 1, 2025, and the financial
-59-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
institution or licensee is responsible for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive
agent's compliance with such part, and a separate charge is made therefor;
(f) The amount included for electronic title and lien services other than
fees and charges prescribed by law which actually are or will be paid to public
officials for determining the existence of or for perfecting, releasing, or
satisfying any security related to the credit transaction;
(g) The basic time price, which is the sum of subdivisions (c), (d), (e),
and (f) of this subsection;
(h) The time-price differential;
(i) The amount of the time-price balance, which is the sum of subdivisions
(g) and (h) of this subsection, payable in installments by the buyer to the
seller;
(j) The number, amount, and due date or period of each installment;
(k) The time-sales price; and
(l) The amount included for a guaranteed asset protection waiver.
(2) The contract shall contain substantially the following notice: NOTICE
TO THE BUYER. DO NOT SIGN THIS CONTRACT BEFORE YOU READ IT OR IF IT CONTAINS
BLANK SPACES. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A COPY OF THE CONTRACT YOU SIGN.
(3) The items listed in subsection (1) of this section need not be stated
in the sequence or order set forth in such subsection. Additional items may be
included to explain the computations made in determining the amount to be paid
by the buyer. No installment sales contract shall be signed by the buyer or
proffered by the seller when it contains blank spaces to be filled in after
execution, except that if delivery of the goods or services is not made at the
time of the execution of the contract, the identifying numbers or marks of the
goods, or similar information, and the due date of the first installment may be
inserted in the contract after its execution.
(4) If a seller proffers an installment sales contract as part of a
transaction which delays or cancels, or promises to delay or cancel, the
payment of the time-price differential on the contract if the buyer pays the
basic time price, cash price, or cash sale price within a certain period of
time, the seller shall, in clear and conspicuous writing, either within the
installment sales contract or in a separate document, inform the buyer of the
exact date by which the buyer must pay the basic time price, cash price, or
cash sale price in order to delay or cancel the payment of the time-price
differential. The seller or any subsequent purchaser of the installment sales
contract, including a sales finance company, shall not be allowed to change
such date.
(5) Upon written request from the buyer, the holder of an installment
sales contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written statement of the
dates and amounts of payments and the total amount unpaid under such contract.
A buyer shall be given a written receipt for any payment when made in cash.
(6) After payment of all sums for which the buyer is obligated under a
contract, the holder shall deliver or mail to the buyer at his or her last-
known address one or more good and sufficient instruments or copies thereof to
acknowledge payment in full and shall release all security in the goods and
mark canceled and return to the buyer the original agreement or copy thereof or
instruments or copies thereof signed by the buyer. For purposes of this

Section 34:
section, a copy shall meet the requirements of section 25-12,112.
Sec. 86. (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the
time-price differential for any goods or services sold under an installment
sales contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual percentage rate
and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to exceed eighteen percent per
annum, except that a minimum time-price differential of ten dollars may be
charged on any installment sales contract.
(b) Origination fees may be required to be made by the buyer, subject to
the following requirements:
(i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the installment sales
contract, to pay an origination fee in an amount not to exceed ten dollars,
except that if the installment sales contract is for an installment sale of
agricultural machinery or equipment for use in commercial agriculture or if the
installment sales contract is for an installment sale of industrial machinery
or equipment, the buyer may be required to pay (A) an origination fee of not to
exceed one hundred dollars if the cash sale price is less than twenty-five
thousand dollars or (B) an origination fee of not to exceed two hundred fifty
dollars if the cash sale price is twenty-five thousand dollars or more; and
(ii) The origination fee shall be refundable if the installment sales
contract is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination fee may be
collected from the buyer or included in the principal balance of the
installment sales contract at the time the contract is made and shall not be
considered interest or a time-price differential.
(c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act prohibits a
seller or holder of an installment sales contract from contracting for,
computing, and charging a time-price differential based upon the application of
the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number of days
actually elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used for the purpose of
calculating the time-price differential, the time-price balance, the amount of
each installment, and the time-sale price.
(d) When the installment sales contract is payable in substantially equal
and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential shall be
computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined under section
85 of this act, from the date of the contract until the due date of the final
installment, notwithstanding that the time-price balance is required to be paid
-60-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
in installments.
(2) When an installment sales contract provides for payment other than in
substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price
differential may be at a rate which will provide the same return as is
permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts under subdivision
(1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the schedule of payments.
(3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide for
payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each installment
or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall be determined.
Sec. 87. (1) The amount, if any, included for insurance, which may be
purchased by the holder of the contract, shall not exceed the applicable
premium rates chargeable in accordance with filings, if any, with the
Department of Insurance. If dual interest insurance on the goods is purchased
by the holder, it shall, within thirty days after execution of the installment
sales contract, send or cause to be sent to the buyer a policy or policies or
certificate of insurance, written by an insurance company authorized to do
business in this state, clearly setting forth the amount of the premium, the
kind or kinds of insurance, the coverages, and all the terms and conditions of
the contract or contracts of insurance.
(2) If any insurance is canceled or the premium adjusted during the term
of the installment sales contract, any refund of the insurance premium plus the
unearned time-price differential thereon received by the holder shall be
credited by the holder to the last maturing installment of the contract except
to the extent applied toward payment for similar insurance protecting the
interests of the buyer and the holder or either of them.
(3) If any insurance is canceled due to the payment of all sums for which
the buyer is liable under an installment sales contract, the holder of the
installment sales contract shall, upon receipt of payment of all sums due, send
notice to the buyer within fifteen business days of the name, address, and
telephone number of the insurance company which issued the insurance contract
or the party responsible for any refund, and notice that the buyer may be
eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of
the installment sales contract. This subsection does not apply if the holder of
the loan contract previously credited the refund of the insurance premium to
the loan contract or otherwise refunded the insurance premium to the buyer.
(4) The holder may also purchase nonfiling insurance and charge a
reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges
prescribed by law which would have been paid to public officials for filing,
perfecting, releasing, and satisfying any lien or security interest in the
goods or services.
Sec. 88. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the
contrary, any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the
obligation of any contract.
(2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall receive a
rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount obtained by
applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or, if
deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according to the
actuarial method, the rate of the time-price differential previously stated to
the borrower. The licensee may round the rate of the time-price differential to
the nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently used
to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and
deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less than one
dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the contract shall not in
itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained before the final installment
date, the contract balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be
required for prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained.
Sec. 89. (1) Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods or
services from a seller from whom such buyer has previously purchased goods or
services under one or more installment sales contracts and the amounts under
such contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price thereof have not
been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may be included in and consolidated
with one or more of the prior contract or contracts. A memorandum of such
additional purchases shall be prepared by the seller and inserted in or
attached to the seller's counterpart of the contract and shall set forth:
(a) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the
additional goods or services sold and all the information with respect to the
additional purchase required by section 85 of this act to be included in an
installment sales contract;
(b) The consolidated time-price balance to be paid by the buyer; and
(c) The revised payments.
(2) A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as provided
in and subject to section 85 of this act. When such subsequent purchases are
made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such subsequent purchases
shall be deemed to have been applied on previous purchases.
(3) Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment sales
contract shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases in the
same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the various
purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred payment is
increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the subsequent payments,
at the seller's option, may be deemed to be allocated as follows: An amount
equal to the original installment payment to the previous purchase, the balance
-61-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
to the subsequent purchase. The amount of any initial payment or downpayment on
the subsequent purchase shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent
purchase. This section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or
other merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or to
repairs or services in connection therewith rendered by the seller at the
buyer's request.
Sec. 90. (1) An installment sales contract may provide and the holder
thereof may collect, in addition to any time-price differential, a delinquency
charge on each installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen
days, if provided for in the contract, not in excess of five percent of each
installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu thereof,
interest after maturity on each such installment not exceeding the highest
permissible contract rate. If the time-price differential is computed by
application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number
of days actually elapsed, such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent
of each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any
installment payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is
not honored because of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason
except an error of a third party to the contract, the holder may charge and
collect a fee of not more than fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such
fee may be collected when due or at any time thereafter.
(2) When an installment sales contract is for a commercial or business
purpose (a) a delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of each unpaid
installment may be contracted for and received and (b) the holder of any check
or draft or similar order which is not honored for any reason, except for error
of a third party, may charge and collect a fee as stated in the contract. As
used in this section, commercial or business purpose means primarily for a
purpose other than a personal, family, or household purpose.
Sec. 91. The holder of a retail installment sales contract may, upon
agreement with the buyer:
(1) Extend the scheduled due date or defer the scheduled payment of any
installment payment under the retail installment sales contract; and
(2) Charge and collect a reasonable flat service fee for such extension or
deferment in addition to the time-price differential calculated for the period
of such extension or deferment at the rate originally agreed upon in the retail
installment sales contract on the outstanding balance.
Sec. 92. (1) If any seller or sales finance company, in the making or
collection of an installment sales contract, shall, directly or indirectly,
contract for, take, or receive charges in excess of those authorized by the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act except as a result of an accidental and
bona fide error, such contract shall be void and uncollectible as to (a) all of
the excessive portion of the time-price differential, (b) the first one
thousand dollars of the time-price differential authorized by section 86 of
this act, and (c) the first four thousand dollars of the principal of the
contract.
(2) If any seller or sales finance company violates any provision of the
act, other than the violations described in subsection (1) of this section,
except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error, such installment sales
contract shall be void and uncollectible as to the first five hundred dollars
of the time-price differential and the first one thousand dollars of the
principal of such contract. If any of such money has been paid by the buyer,
such buyer or his or her assignee may recover under the act in a civil suit
brought within one year after the due date, or any extension thereof, of the
last installment of the contract.
Sec. 93. (1) A licensee shall not refuse to enter into a loan or impose
finance charges or other terms or conditions of credit more onerous than those
regularly extended by that licensee to borrowers of similar economic
backgrounds because of the age, color, creed, national origin, political
affiliation, race, religion, sex, marital status, or disability of the borrower
or because the borrower receives public assistance, social security benefits,
pension benefits, or the like.
(2) No licensee shall conduct the business of making loans under the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act within any office, room, or place of
business in which any other business is solicited or engaged in, or in
association or conjunction with any other business, if the director finds that
the other business is of such nature that the conducting of such other business
tends to conceal evasion of the act or of the rules and regulations adopted and
promulgated under the act. In such case, the director shall order such licensee
in writing to cease and desist from such conduct.
(3) No licensee shall, directly or indirectly, require a borrower as a
condition of granting a loan to such borrower to reaffirm or otherwise obligate
the borrower to pay a former debt to the licensee which has been discharged in
bankruptcy proceedings.
(4) Any person who makes a false statement to secure a loan is guilty of a
Class III misdemeanor. The punishment shall not be exacted, however, when such
a loan is made after the licensee is aware of the falsity of the statement.
(5) No licensee or other person subject to the Nebraska Installment Loan
and Sales Act shall advertise, print, display, publish, distribute, or
broadcast or cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed, published,
distributed, or broadcast in any manner whatsoever any false, misleading, or
deceptive statement or representation with regard to the rates, terms, or
conditions for the lending of money, credit, goods, or things in action. The
director may order any licensee to cease and desist from any conduct which he
-62-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
or she finds to be a violation of this section. The director may require that
rates of charge, if stated by a licensee, be stated fully and clearly in such
manner as the director deems necessary to prevent misunderstanding by
prospective borrowers.
(6) No loan, made outside this state, in the amount or of the value of
three thousand dollars or less, for which a greater rate of interest,
consideration, or charges than is permitted by section 45-350 has been charged,
contracted for, or received, shall be enforced in this state. Every person
participating in such loan in this state is subject to the Nebraska Installment
Loan and Sales Act, except that the act shall not apply to loans legally made
in any state under and in accordance with a regulatory small loan law similar
in principle to such act.
(7) In connection with the collection of any loan, a licensee may not:
(a) Use or threaten to use violence;
(b) Use obscene or profane language;
(c) Cause a telephone to ring or engage a person in telephone conversation
at times known to be inconvenient to the borrower;
(d) Falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of any debt;
(e) Falsely represent that an individual is an attorney when he or she is
not;
(f) Falsely represent that nonpayment of any debt will result in the
arrest or imprisonment of the borrower or any member of the borrower's
household;
(g) Threaten to take any action that the licensee knows cannot legally be
taken at the time the threat is made;
(h) Falsely represent that the borrower committed any crime when the
borrower did not;
(i) Communicate or threaten to communicate to any person credit
information which is known to be false;
(j) Use or distribute any written communication which falsely represents
that it is a document authorized, issued, or approved by any court, official,
or agency of the United States or any state;
(k) Charge or collect any fees, charges, or expenses, incidental to the
collection of any loan, unless such amount is expressly authorized by the loan
agreement or permitted by law;
(l) Accept from any person a check or other payment instrument postdated
by more than five days unless such person is notified in writing of the
licensee's intent to deposit such check or instrument not more than ten nor

notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid any
such error.

of this act an award of liquidated damages in an amount determined by the
court, but not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand
dollars. In any legal action brought pursuant to this section in which the
licensee is found liable, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney's
fees to the borrower. A licensee is not liable under this section if the

the borrower written notice of the error or before the borrower has brought an
action under this section and the licensee corrects the error within thirty
days after notifying the borrower. A licensee may not be held liable in any
action brought under this section if the licensee shows by a preponderance of
evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide

the error.
Sec. 98. Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any
person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act, the director may, in addition to any action
provided in the act and without prejudice thereto, enter an order requiring
such person to cease and desist or to refrain from such violation. An action
may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney General and the director,
to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from
doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation. In any such action, an
order or judgment may be entered awarding such preliminary or final injunction
as may be deemed proper. In addition to all other means provided by law for the
enforcement of a restraining order or injunction, the court, in which such
action is brought, has power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver
for the property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court may
deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska Installment
Loan and Sales Act through or by means of the use of such property and
business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, has such powers and
duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up, and liquidation
of such property and business as shall, from time to time, be conferred upon
the receiver by the court.
Sec. 99. (1) The department may order any person to cease and desist
whenever the department determines that the person has violated any provision
of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. Upon entry of a cease and
desist order, the director shall promptly notify the affected person that such
order has been entered, of the reasons for such order, and that upon receipt,
within fifteen business days after the date of the order, of written request
from the affected person a hearing will be scheduled within thirty business
days after the date of receipt of the written request unless the parties
consent to a later date or the hearing officer sets a later date for good
cause. If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the director, the
order shall remain in effect until it is modified or vacated.
(2) The director may vacate or modify a cease and desist order if he or
she finds that the conditions which caused its entry have changed or that it is
otherwise in the public interest to do so.
(3) A person aggrieved by a cease and desist order of the director may
obtain judicial review of the order in the manner prescribed in the
Administrative Procedure Act and the rules and regulations adopted and
promulgated by the department under the act. The director may obtain an order
from the district court of Lancaster County for the enforcement of the cease
and desist order.

after notice and hearing and upon further order of the director, be subject to
a penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each act in violation of
the cease and desist order. The department shall remit fines collected under
this section to the State Treasurer for distribution in accordance with Article
VII, section 5, of the Constitution of Nebraska.
Sec. 100. (1) The director may, following a hearing under the
Administrative Procedure Act, impose an administrative fine against any
officer, director, shareholder, partner, or member of a licensee, if the
director finds the licensee or any such person participated in or had knowledge
of any act prohibited by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act or
otherwise violated the act. Such administrative fine shall be in addition to or
separate from any fine imposed against a licensee pursuant to section 45-346.
(2) If the director finds, after notice and hearing in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has knowingly committed any act
prohibited by section 93 of this act or otherwise violated the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act or any rule and regulation or order adopted
thereunder, the director may order such person to pay (a) an administrative
fine of not more than five thousand dollars for each separate violation and (b)
the costs of investigation.
(3) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
investigation ordered pursuant to this section, a lien in the amount of such
fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of such person in
this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the director. The lien
-65-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
shall attach to the real property of such person when notice of the lien is
filed and indexed against the real property in the office of the register of
deeds in the county where the real property is located. The lien shall attach
to any other property of such person when notice of the lien is filed against
the property in the manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such
fine and costs shall constitute a separate violation of the act.
(4) The department shall remit fines collected under this section to the
State Treasurer for distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of
the Constitution of Nebraska.

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Section 8-319, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
8-319 (1) No loan shall be made by such association except to its own
members, and no loan shall be made to any member for any sum in excess of the
par value of his or her stock. The borrower shall pledge to the association, as
security for the loan, shares of a maturity value equal to the principal of the
loan and, except as otherwise provided in this section, ample security by
mortgage or deeds of trust on real estate. For purposes of this section, real
property and real estate shall include a leasehold or subleasehold estate in
real property under a lease or sublease the term of which does not expire, or
which is renewable automatically or at the option of the holder or of the
association so as not to expire for at least five years beyond the maturity of
the debt. Loans made upon improved real estate, except as otherwise provided in
this section, shall not exceed ninety-five percent of the reasonable normal
cash value thereof, and all loans made on any other real estate shall not
exceed three-fourths of the reasonable normal cash value thereof.
(2) An association may make a loan or loans in an amount exceeding ninety-
five percent of the reasonable normal cash value of the real estate security
(a) if such loan or loans are made to a veteran in accord with the provisions
of 38 U.S.C., as now existing or as hereafter amended, (b) if the proceeds of
the loan or loans are to be used in purchasing residential property or in
constructing a dwelling on unimproved property owned by such veteran to be
occupied as his or her home, used for the purpose of making repairs,
alterations, or improvements in or paying delinquent indebtedness, taxes, or
special assessments on residential property owned by the veteran and used by
him or her as his or her home, or used in purchasing any land and buildings to
be used by the applicant in pursuing a gainful occupation other than farming,
-1-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
and (c) if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs guarantees that portion of such
loan or loans in excess of ninety-five percent of the reasonable normal cash
value of the real estate security.
(3) An association is authorized to obtain insurance of its loans by the
Federal Housing Administrator under Title II of the National Housing Act, as
amended, and such loans so made upon improved real estate and so insured shall
not be subject to the restrictions set forth in this section with reference to
the maximum authorized amount of a loan.
(4) An association may make unsecured loans to its members if such loans
(a) are insured under Title I and Title II of the National Housing Act, as
amended, or (b) are for property alterations, repair, or improvements. The
aggregate amount of loans made under subdivisions (a) and (b) of this
subsection shall not at any time exceed twenty percent of the association's
assets. Each loan made under subdivision (b) of this subsection shall be
repayable in regular monthly installments within a period of twenty years and
shall be supported by a written property statement on forms to be prescribed by
the Department of Banking and Finance. An association may make secured loans to
its members and may make loans under 38 U.S.C., as amended, under Chapter V,
subchapter C of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended (12 U.S.C.), and
on the security of mobile homes.
(5) The stock of such association may be accepted as security for a loan
of the amount of the withdrawal value of such stock without other security.
(6) An association when so licensed may make loans to its own members upon
the terms and security set forth in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act.
(7) Any provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, an
association may make any loan that a federal savings and loan association doing
business in this state is or may be authorized to make.
(8) An association may invest in loans, obligations, and advances of
credit, all of which are referred to in this subsection as loans, made for the
payment of expenses of business school, technical training school, college, or
university education, but no association shall make any investment in loans
under this subsection if the principal amount of its investment in such loans,
exclusive of any investment which is or which at the time of its making was
otherwise authorized, would thereupon exceed five percent of its assets. Such
loans may be secured, partly secured, or unsecured, and the association may
require a comaker or comakers, insurance, guaranty under a governmental student
loan guarantee plan, or other protection against contingencies. The borrower
shall certify to the association that the proceeds of the loan are to be used
by a full-time student solely for the payment of expenses of business,
technical training school, college, or university education.
(9) An association may participate with other lenders in making loans of
any type that an association may otherwise make if (a) each of the lenders is
either an instrumentality of the United States Government or is insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or, in the case of another lender, the
interest of the association in such loan is superior to the participating
interests of the other participants and (b) an association whose accounts are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which may be a federal
association or an association chartered by this state, or another association
chartered by this state which is not so insured, has otherwise complied with
subsection (1) of this section with respect to loans to members.
(10) An association may sell to or purchase from any institution which is
a savings association chartered by this state or the accounts of which are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation a participating interest
in any loan, whether or not, in the case of a purchase, the security is located
within the association's regular lending area.
Sec. 2. Section 8-330, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended to
read:
8-330 Every association may require borrowing members to pay all
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the making, closing,
disbursing, extending, readjusting, or renewing of real estate loans. Such
expenses may include abstract, recording, and registration fees, title
examinations, survey, escrow services, and taxes or charges imposed upon or in
connection with the making and recording of any mortgage. Such reasonable
charges may be collected by the association from the borrower and shall not be
considered interest or a charge for the use of the money loaned. A charge not
exceeding one percent or that allowed a federally chartered association for the
premature prepayment may be made. The rate of interest on any loan of money
shall be determined and computed upon the assumption that the debt will be paid
according to the agreed terms and in the event the loan is paid or collected by
court action prior to the term of the loan, any payment charged, received, or
taken as an advance or forbearance which is in the nature of and taken into
account in the calculation of interest, shall be spread over the stated term of
the loan for the purpose of determining the rate of interest. Any amounts paid
or contracted to be paid by persons other than the borrower shall not be
considered interest and shall not be taken into account in the calculation of
interest. Interest may be paid on escrow accounts held for the payment of
taxes, insurance, and similar payments, if agreed to in writing by the borrower
and association. Loans may be made by an association under a license granted it
pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, to borrowing members
whose loans are secured by real estate, to the same extent and in the same
amount as such loans may lawfully be made to nonborrowing members. The
association shall furnish a loan settlement statement to each borrower,
-2-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
indicating in detail the charges and fees such borrower has paid or obligated
himself or herself to pay to the association or to any other person in
connection with such loan. A copy of such statement shall be retained in the
records of the association.
An association may charge and receive interest, on property improvement
loans including loans made under Title I of the National Housing Act, as
amended, and unsecured loans authorized in section 5(c) of the Home Owners'
Loan Act, as amended.
Sec. 3. Section 8-601, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended to
read:
8-601 The Director of Banking and Finance may employ deputies, examiners,
attorneys, and other assistants as may be necessary for the administration of
the provisions and purposes of the Credit Union Act, Delayed Deposit Services
Licensing Act, Interstate Branching and Merger Act, Interstate Trust Company
Office Act, Nebraska Bank Holding Company Act of 1995, Nebraska Banking Act,
Nebraska Financial Innovation Act, Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act,
Nebraska Installment Sales Act, Nebraska Money Transmitters Act, Nebraska Trust
Company Act, and Residential Mortgage Licensing Act; Chapter 8, articles 3, 5,
6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 24, and 25; and Chapter 45, articles 1 and 2.
The director may levy upon financial institutions, namely, the banks, trust
companies, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations,
savings banks, digital asset depositories, and credit unions, organized under
the laws of this state, and holding companies, if any, of such financial
institutions, an assessment each year based upon the asset size of the
financial institution, except that in determining the asset size of a holding
company or digital asset depository, the assets of any financial institution or
holding company otherwise assessed pursuant to this section and the assets of
any nationally chartered financial institution shall be excluded. The
assessment for digital asset depositories under the Nebraska Financial
Innovation Act shall be in an amount to offset the costs of supervision and
administration of the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act. The assessment shall
be a sum determined by the director in accordance with section 8-606 and
approved by the Governor.
Sec. 4. Section 8-602, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
8-602 The Director of Banking and Finance shall charge and collect fees
for certain services rendered by the Department of Banking and Finance

Sec. 5. Section 8-820.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
8-820.01 It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the State of
Nebraska that for purposes of applying the federal most-favored-lender
doctrine, the bank credit card rate contained in section 8-820 is not
comparable or analogous to the small loan rate found in section 70 of this act
sections 45-1024 and section 45-350 45-1025. The Legislature finds that the
institutions making small loans and the institutions administering a bank
credit card are categorically different. The transactions carried on by these
institutions are categorically different. The Legislature finds that small loan
borrowers and bank credit card users are not synonymous or comparable. In
establishing a small loan rate, the Legislature has recognized a risk factor
that is different and greater than other financial transactions and therefor
justifies the charging of a higher interest rate than installment loans,
personal loans, retail revolving credit plans, or bank credit card interest
rates.

that have a market value computed in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles of not less than the aggregate amount of all of
its outstanding money transmission obligations.
(2) Except for permissible investments described in subsection (1) of
section 8-2733, the director, with respect to any licensee, may, by order,
limit the extent to which a specific investment maintained by a licensee within
a class of permissible investments may be considered a permissible investment,
if the specific investment represents undue risk to customers, not reflected in
the market value of the investment.
(3) Permissible investments, even if commingled with other assets of the
licensee, are held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of
the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations in the event of
insolvency, the filing of a petition by or against the licensee under the
United States Bankruptcy Code for bankruptcy or reorganization, the filing of a

investments held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the

basis for permissible investments required to be held in this state, and other
states, as applicable. Any statutory trust established under this subsection
shall be terminated upon extinguishment of all of the licensee's outstanding
money transmission obligations.
(6) The director, by rule or order, may allow any other type of
investment, that the director determines is of sufficient liquidity and
quality, to be a permissible investment. The director is authorized to
participate in efforts with other state regulators to determine whether other
types of investments are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a
permissible investment.
Each applicant shall submit, with the application, an application fee of
one thousand dollars, and any processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of
section 8-2730 which shall not be subject to refund but which, if the license

prior to any expiration date that the irrevocable letter of credit will not be
extended.
(iii) In the event of any notice of expiration or nonextension of a letter

outstanding money transmission obligations.

credit if the proceeds of the drawable amount for the purposes of this section
are assigned to the director.
(vi) The director is authorized to participate in multistate processes
designed to facilitate the issuance and administration of letters of credit,
including, but not limited to, services provided by the Nationwide Mortgage

the Nebraska Money Transmitters Act, and the previous conduct of the person
involved.
(3) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license by delivering to the
director written notice of the surrender.

the director may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel
attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers,
correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the
director deems relevant or material to the inquiry. If any person refuses to
comply with a subpoena issued under this subsection or to testify with respect
to any matter relevant to the proceeding, the district court of Lancaster
County may, on application of the director, issue an order requiring the person
to comply with the subpoena and to testify. Failure to obey an order of the
court to comply with the subpoena may be punished by the court as civil
contempt.

the home office of the company or to any agent of the company upon delivery of
a receipt signed by one or more of the officers who shall be named in the
policy.
(2) A provision that the insured is entitled to a grace of one month
within which the payment of any premium, after the first year, may be made,
subject, at the option of the company, to an interest charge not in excess of
six percent per annum for the number of days of grace elapsing before the
payment of the premium, during which period of grace the policy shall continue
in force; but in case the policy becomes a claim during the said period of
grace before the overdue premium or the deferred premiums of the current policy
year, if any, are paid, the amount of such premiums, with interest on any
overdue premium, may be deducted from any amount payable under the policy in
settlement.
(3) A provision that the policy shall constitute the entire contract
between the parties; but if the company desires to make the application a part
of the contract, it may do so; Provided, a copy of such application shall be
endorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued, and in such case, the
policy shall contain a provision that the policy and the application therefor
shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.
(4) A provision that all statements made by the insured shall, in the
absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties, and that no
such statement shall avoid the policy unless it is contained in a written
application, and a copy of such application shall be endorsed upon or attached
to the policy when issued.
(5) A provision that the policy shall be incontestable after it shall have
been in force during the lifetime of the insured for two years from its date,
except for nonpayment of premiums and except with respect to limitations of
liability which may be contained in the policy relating to (a) death resulting
from war or acts of war, declared or undeclared, where such limitations shall
have been found by the Director of Insurance to be in keeping with the
interests of the policyholders of the company and to be not unfairly
discriminatory, and (b) aeronautics other than as a fare-paying passenger of a
commercial airline, and flying on a regularly scheduled route between
definitely established airports; and in any such cases the liability of the
company may be limited by the terms of the policy to a sum not less than the
reserve on the face of the policy and the reserve on any paid-up additions
thereto and any dividends standing to the credit of the policy, less any
indebtedness to the company on the policy; and, at the option of the company,
provisions relative to benefits in the event of total and permanent disability,

accident may be excepted from the incontestable clause; Provided, limitations
with reference to aeronautics shall not be included in any policy where an
extra premium is charged to cover the aeronautic risk, nor shall any such
limitations extending beyond the contestable period be included in or attached
to any policy where the applicant for insurance has not elected in writing to

amount payable under the policy shall be such as the premium paid would have

amount shall be carried as a distinct and separate liability in favor of such
policies. The insured, under any annual dividend policy, shall have the right
each year to have the dividend arising from such participation paid in cash,
and if the policy shall provide other dividend options, it shall further
provide that, if the insured shall not elect any such other options, one of
such dividend options provided shall become effective as provided in the
policy; but such participation and its distribution may, by contract, be
deferred to a fixed or specified time, not exceeding twenty years. Upon written
request of the insured the company shall furnish him or her with a statement of
the amount of the surplus provisionally ascertained or set aside on such policy
and held awaiting distribution at the expiration of the deferred dividend
period.
(8) A provision that after three full years' premiums have been paid, the
company at any time, while the policy is in force, will advance, on proper
assignment or pledge of the policy, and on the sole security thereof, at a
specified rate of interest determined pursuant to section 44-502.03 a sum equal
to, or, at the option of the owner of the policy, less than the amount required
by section 44-405, under the conditions specified thereby, and that the company
will deduct from such loan value any existing indebtedness on the policy, which
has not otherwise entered into the computation of such loan value, together
with any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and may
collect interest in advance on the loan to the end of the current policy year.
Interest if payable annually in advance shall not exceed an effective rate
equivalent to the specified rate of interest determined pursuant to section
44-502.03. It shall be further stipulated in the policy that failure to repay
any such advance, or to pay interest, shall not avoid the policy unless the
total indebtedness thereon to the company shall equal or exceed such loan value
at the time of such failure, nor until one month after notice shall have been
mailed by the company to the last-known address of the insured and of the
assignee, if any. No condition other than as provided herein, or in section
44-405, shall be exacted as prerequisite to any such advance.
(9) A provision for nonforfeiture benefits and cash surrender values in
accordance with the requirements of sections 44-406 to 44-407.09.
(10) A table showing in figures the loan values, if any, and the options
available under the policies each year upon default in premium payments, during
at least the first twenty years of the policy.
(11) A provision that if, in the event of default in premium payments, the
value of the policy shall be applied to the purchase of other insurance, and if
such insurance shall be in force and the original policy shall not have been
surrendered to the company and canceled, the policy may be reinstated within
three years from such default, upon evidence of insurability satisfactory to
the company and payment of arrears of premiums with interest and the payment or
reinstatement of any other indebtedness to the company upon such policy.
(12) A provision that when a policy shall become a claim by the death of
the insured, settlement shall be made upon receipt of due proof of death, or
not later than two months after receipt of such proof.
(13) In case the proceeds of a policy are payable in installments, or as
an annuity, a table showing the amounts of the installments or annuity
payments.
(14) A title on the face of the policy correctly describing the same. Any
of the foregoing provisions or portions of this section not applicable by
reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent of inapplicability, be
omitted from the policy. Any such policy may be issued or delivered in this
state which in the opinion of the Department of Insurance contains provisions
on any one or more of the several foregoing requirements more favorable to the
policyholder than hereinbefore required.
(15)(a) For policies issued or delivered in this state on or after January
1, 2026, a provision that, at least fifteen days prior to termination or lapse
by reason of default in payment of any premium due on such policy, a notice
will be sent electronically or mailed to the last-known address of the owner
and any assignee on record with the company.

this section for each installment loan license the person holds;
(ii) The person maintains a mortgage banker surety bond as provided in
section 45-724; and
(iii) The mortgage banker surety bond covers all transactions involving
residential mortgage loans, including such transactions done pursuant to the
person's installment loan license or licenses.
(4) Should the department determine that an installment loan licensee does
not maintain a supplemental surety bond in the amount required by subsection
(2) or (3) of this section, the department shall give written notification to
the licensee requiring the licensee to increase the surety bond within thirty
days to the amount required by subsection (2) or (3) of this section.
(5) The bond or a substitute bond required by subsection (1) of this
section, applicable to all licensees under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
Sales Act, shall remain in effect or the licensee shall immediately cease
conducting licensable activity. If a licensee fails to maintain a surety bond
as required under this section, the department may issue a notice of
cancellation of the license in lieu of revocation proceedings.
(1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the time-price
differential for any goods or services sold under an installment contract shall
be stated as a fixed or variable annual percentage rate and shall be at a rate
agreed to in writing, not to exceed eighteen percent per annum, except that a
minimum time-price differential of ten dollars may be charged on any
installment contract.
(b)(i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the installment
contract, to pay an origination fee of not to exceed ten dollars, except that
if the installment contract is for an installment sale of agricultural
machinery or equipment for use in commercial agriculture or if the installment
contract is for an installment sale of industrial machinery or equipment the
buyer may be required to pay (A) an origination fee of not to exceed one
hundred dollars if the cash sale price is less than twenty-five thousand
dollars or (B) an origination fee of not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars if
the cash sale price is twenty-five thousand dollars or more.
(ii) The origination fee shall be refundable if the installment contract
is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination fee may be collected

at the time the contract is made and shall not be considered interest or a
time-price differential.
(c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act prohibits a seller or
holder of an installment contract from contracting for, computing, and charging
a time-price differential based upon the application of the rate charged to the
unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually elapsed. The charges
so computed shall be used for the purpose of calculating the time-price
differential, the time-price balance, the amount of each installment, and the
time-sale price.
(d) When the installment contract is payable in substantially equal and
consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential shall be computed
on the basic time price of each contract, as determined under the provisions of
section 45-336, from the date of the contract until the due date of the final
installment, notwithstanding that the time-price balance is required to be paid
in installments.
(2) When an installment contract provides for payment other than in
substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price
differential may be at a rate which will provide the same return as is
permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts under subdivision
(1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the schedule of payments.
(3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide for
payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each installment
or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall be determined.

to read:

(a) Two hundred fifty dollars for an installment loan branch license; and
(b) One hundred dollars for an installment sales branch license.
Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods or services from a
seller from whom he has previously purchased goods or services under one or
more installment contracts and the amounts under such contract or contracts to
the extent of cash sale price thereof have not been fully paid the subsequent
purchases may be included in and consolidated with one or more of the prior
contract or contracts. A memorandum of such additional purchases shall be
prepared by the seller and inserted in or attached to the seller's counterpart
of the contract and shall set forth:
(1) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the
additional goods or services sold and all the information with respect to the
additional purchase required by section 45-336 to be included in an installment
contract;
(2) The consolidated time-price balance to be paid by the buyer; and
(3) The revised payments.
A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as provided in
and subject to the provisions of section 45-336. When such subsequent purchases
are made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such subsequent
purchases shall be deemed to have been applied on previous purchases.
Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment contract shall
be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases in the same ratio or
proportion as the original cash sale prices of the various purchases bear to
one another. Where the amount of each deferred payment is increased in
connection with such subsequent purchase, the subsequent payments, at the
seller's option, may be deemed to be allocated as follows: An amount equal to
the original installment payment to the previous purchase, the balance to the
subsequent purchase. The amount of any initial payment or downpayment on the
subsequent purchase shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent
purchase. The provisions of this section shall not apply to cases involving
equipment, parts, or to other merchandise attached or affixed to goods
previously purchased, or to repairs or services in connection therewith
rendered by the seller at the buyer's request.
Sec. 61. Section 45-340, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-340 (1) For the annual renewal of an original license under the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, the licensee shall file a renewal

license;
(c) One hundred fifty dollars for an installment sales license; and
(d) One hundred dollars for an installment sales branch license.

voluntarily surrender the license pursuant to this section, the department may
issue a notice of expiration of the license to the licensee in lieu of
revocation proceedings.
(4) Renewal of a license originally granted under the Nebraska Installment
Loan and Sales Act may be denied by the director on the following grounds:
(a) Material misstatement in the application for a license;
(b) Willful failure to comply with any provision of the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act relating to installment sales contracts or
installment loans;
(c) Failure to continue to meet the conditions under which the original
license was granted;
(d) Defrauding any buyer to the buyer's damage; or
(e) Fraudulent misrepresentation, circumvention, or concealment by the
licensee through whatever subterfuge or device of any of the material
particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to a
consumer.
(5) Any person, licensee, or applicant potentially aggrieved by an order
of the director entered under this section may appeal the order. The appeal
shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
Installment contracts negotiated and entered into by mail without personal
solicitation by salespersons or other representatives of the seller and based
upon the catalog of the seller or other printed solicitation of business, which
is distributed and made available generally to the public, if such catalog or
other printed solicitation clearly sets forth the cash and time-sale prices and
other terms of sales to be made through such medium, may be made as provided in
this section. All provisions of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act shall apply
to such sales except that the seller shall not be required to deliver a copy of
the contract to the buyer as provided in section 45-336 and if the contract
when received by the seller contains any blank spaces the seller may insert in
the appropriate blank space the amounts of money and other terms which are set
forth in the seller's catalog or other printed solicitation which is then in
effect. In lieu of sending the buyer a copy of the contract as provided in
section 45-336, the seller shall furnish to the buyer a written statement of
any items inserted in the blank spaces in the contract received from the buyer.

separate violation of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. The
department shall remit fines collected under this subsection to the State
Treasurer for distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the
Constitution of Nebraska. The director may suspend or revoke a license or fine
a licensee under this subsection if the director finds:
(a) The licensee has materially violated or demonstrated a continuing
pattern of violating the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, rules and
regulations adopted and promulgated under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
Sales Act, any order issued under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act,
or any other state or federal law applicable to the conduct of the licensee's

(d) The licensee has knowingly provided or caused to be provided to the
director any false or fraudulent representation of a material fact or any false

(j) The licensee knowingly has employed any individual or knowingly has
maintained a contractual relationship with any individual acting as an agent,
if such individual is conducting activities requiring a mortgage loan
originator license in this state without first obtaining such license.
(3) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or
revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed
association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership or limited
liability company has so acted or failed to act as would be cause for
suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.
(4) No license shall be denied, suspended, or revoked except after hearing
in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The director shall give a
licensee at least ten days' written notice, in the form of an order to show
cause, of the time and place of such hearing by either registered or certified
mail addressed to the principal place of business in this state of such
licensee. Such notice shall contain the grounds of complaint against the
licensee. Any order suspending or revoking such license shall recite the
grounds upon which the order is based. The order shall be entered upon the
records of the director and shall not be effective until after thirty days'
written notice thereof given after such entry forwarded by either registered or
certified mail to the licensee at the principal place of business in this state
of such licensee.

entered into or acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
(6) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender of any
-44-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025

the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act for acts committed before the
revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender of the license.
(7) Whenever, for any cause, a license is revoked, the department shall
not issue another license to the licensee unless the department is otherwise
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so.

department shall prepare a written record which includes a transcript of the
evidence, the findings with respect to the evidence, the order, and the reasons
supporting the suspension, revocation, or denial of a license, and shall, after
being paid for the cost of the written record, deliver to the licensee or other
aggrieved person a copy of the written record in person or by certified or
registered mail.

An installment contract may provide and the holder thereof may collect, in
addition to any time-price differential, a delinquency charge on each
installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen days, if provided
for in the contract, not in excess of five percent of each installment or
twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu thereof, interest after
maturity on each such installment not exceeding the highest permissible
contract rate. If the time-price differential is computed by application of the
rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually
elapsed, such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent of each
installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any installment
payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is not honored
because of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason except an error
of a third party to the contract, the holder may charge and collect a fee of
not more than fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such fee may be
collected when due or at any time thereafter.
When an installment contract is for a commercial or business purpose (1) a
delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of each unpaid installment may be
contracted for and received and (2) the holder of any check or draft or similar
order which is not honored for any reason, except for error of a third party,
may charge and collect a fee as stated in the contract. As used in this
section, commercial or business purpose means primarily for a purpose other
than a personal, family, or household purpose.
Sec. 63. Section 45-342, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-342 Any person who, by any device, subterfuge, or pretense whatsoever,
engages in or continues any of the kinds of business or enterprise permitted to
licensees by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act without having
obtained the license required by the act, with intent to evade the provisions
of the act, is guilty of a Class I misdemeanor.
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary, any
buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the obligation of any
contract.
(2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall receive a
rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount obtained by
applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or, if
deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according to the
actuarial method, the rate of the time-price differential previously stated to
the borrower. The licensee may round the rate of the time-price differential to
the nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently used
to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and
deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less than one
dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the contract shall not in
itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained before the final installment
date, the contract balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be
required for prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained.
Sec. 64. Section 45-343, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-343 A licensee may move its main office or may relocate a branch office
from one location to another without obtaining a new license if the licensee
gives notice thereof to the director through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing
System and Registry at least thirty days prior to such move and pays a filing
fee of one hundred fifty dollars. The director may, at the director's
discretion, hold a hearing on the relocation request, in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure Act. The expense of any such hearing shall be paid by
the licensee.
Any person who violates any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales
Act or acts as a sales finance company in this state without a license therefor
as provided in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act shall be guilty of a Class II
misdemeanor.

filing fee of one hundred fifty dollars and any processing fee allowed under
subsection (2) of section 94 of this act.
(2) The director, upon receipt of such notice, shall approve or deny the
acquisition within thirty days.
(3) If the director does not deny the acquisition within such thirty-day
time period, the acquisition shall become effective on the thirty-first day
after the receipt of the notice, except that the director may extend the
thirty-day period an additional thirty days if, in the director's judgment, any
material information submitted is substantially inaccurate or the acquiring
party has not furnished all the information required by the department.
(4) An acquisition may become effective prior to the expiration of the
thirty-day period if the director issues written notice of the director's
approval of such acquisition or the director's intent not to deny the
acquisition.
(5)(a) The director may deny any proposed acquisition if:
(i) The financial condition of any acquiring person is such as might
jeopardize the financial stability of the acquired licensee;
(ii) The character and general fitness of any acquiring person or of any
of the proposed management personnel indicate that the acquired installment
sales licensee or installment loan licensee would not be operated honestly,
fairly, or efficiently within the purposes of the Nebraska Installment Loan and
Sales Act; or
(iii) Any acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish all
information required by the department.
(b) The director shall notify the acquiring party in writing of denial of
the acquisition. The notice shall provide a statement of the basis for the
denial.
(c) Within fifteen business days after receipt of written notice of
denial, the acquiring party may make a written request for a hearing on the
proposed acquisition in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and
rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department under the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. The director shall, by order, approve
or deny the proposed acquisition on the basis of the record made at the
hearing.
If any seller or sales finance company, in the making or collection of an
installment contract, shall, directly or indirectly, contract for, take, or
receive charges in excess of those authorized by the Nebraska Installment Sales
Act except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error such contract shall
be void and uncollectible as to (1) all of the excessive portion of the time-
price differential, (2) the first one thousand dollars of the time-price
differential authorized by section 45-338, and (3) the first four thousand
dollars of the principal of the contract. If any seller or sales finance
company violates any provision of the act, other than the violations described
above, except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error, such
installment contract shall be void and uncollectible as to the first five
hundred dollars of the time-price differential and the first one thousand
dollars of the principal of such contract. If any of such money has been paid
by the buyer, such buyer or his or her assignee may recover under the act in a
civil suit brought within one year after the due date, or any extension
thereof, of the last installment of the contract.

information about a Nebraska resident, or the unauthorized access to or use of
such information about a Nebraska resident as a result of the breach.
(b) If a licensee would be required under Nebraska law to provide
notification to a Nebraska resident regarding such incident, then the licensee
shall provide a copy of such notification to the department prior to or
simultaneously with the licensee's notification to the Nebraska resident.
(c) Notice required by this subsection may be delayed if a law enforcement
agency determines that the notice will impede a criminal investigation. Notice
shall be made in good faith, without unreasonable delay, and as soon as
possible after the law enforcement agency determines that notification will no
longer impede the investigation.
(d) For purposes of this subsection, the terms breach of the security of
the system and personal information have the same meaning as in section 87-802.
(3) A licensee shall maintain the minimum net worth required by section

Loan and Sales Act is in effect. The minimum net worth shall be proven by an
annual audit conducted by a certified public accountant. A licensee shall
submit a copy of the annual audit to the director as required by section 45-337

charges in accordance with law.
(5) All licensees under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act shall,
on or before March 1 of each year, file with the department a report of the
licensee's earnings and operations for the preceding calendar year, the
licensee's assets at the end of the year, and any other relevant information as
the department may reasonably require. The report shall be made under oath and
shall be in the form and manner prescribed by the department.
(6) All installment loan licensees shall submit a mortgage report of
condition as required by section 45-726 on or before a date or dates
established by rule, regulation, or order of the director.
(7) Upon written request of a borrower, the licensee shall provide a

45-346 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in business
activities requiring a license under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act. The department may examine or investigate complaints about or reports of

such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the
director. The lien shall attach to the real property of such person when notice
of the lien is filed and indexed against the real property in the office of the
register of deeds in the county where the real property is located. The lien

additional fifty thousand dollars for each branch location of the applicant
that is licensed under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act. The bond shall be
for the use of the State of Nebraska and any Nebraska resident who may have
claims or causes of action against the applicant. The surety may cancel the
bond only upon thirty days' written notice to the director.
(4) A license fee of one hundred fifty dollars, and, if applicable, a one-
hundred-dollar fee for each branch office listed in the application, and any
processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 shall be
submitted along with each application.
(5) An initial license shall remain in full force and effect until the
next succeeding December 31. Each license shall remain in force until revoked,
suspended, canceled, expired, or surrendered.
(6) The director shall, after an application has been filed for a license
under the act, investigate the facts, and if he or she finds that the
experience, character, and general fitness of the applicant, of the members
thereof if the applicant is a corporation or association, and of the officers
and directors thereof if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to warrant
belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently
within the purpose of the act, the director shall issue and deliver a license
to the applicant to do business as a sales finance company in accordance with
the license and the act. The director shall have the power to reject for cause
any application for a license.
(7) The director shall, within his or her discretion, make an examination
and inspection concerning the propriety of the issuance of a license to any
applicant. The cost of such examination and inspection shall be borne by the
applicant.
(8) If an applicant for a license under the act does not complete the
license application and fails to respond to a notice or notices from the
department to correct the deficiency or deficiencies for a period of one
hundred twenty days or more after the date the department sends the initial
notice to correct the deficiency or deficiencies, the department may deem the
application as abandoned and may issue a notice of abandonment of the
application to the applicant in lieu of proceedings to deny the application.
Sec. 68. Section 45-347, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-347 The payment in money, credit, goods, or things in action, as
consideration for any sale or assignment of, or order for, the payment of
wages, salary, commission, or other compensation for services, whether earned
or to be earned, shall, for purposes of regulation under the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act, be deemed a loan secured by such assignment,
and the amount by which the assigned compensation exceeds the amount of the
consideration actually paid, shall, for the purposes of regulation under the
act, be deemed interest or charges upon the loan from the date of payment to
the date the compensation is payable. Such transaction shall be governed by and
-48-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
be subject to the act.
All money collected under the authority of the Nebraska Installment Sales
Act shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the Financial
Institution Assessment Cash Fund.
Sec. 69. Section 45-348, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-348 Every installment loan licensee shall permit payment to be made in
advance in any amount equal to one or more full installments on any loan
contract at any time during regular business hours, but the licensee may apply
such payment first to all accrued charges in full up to the date of such
payment.
(1) An installment sales license may be renewed annually on or before
December 31 by paying to the director a fee of one hundred fifty dollars, plus
one hundred dollars for each branch office, if applicable, and any processing
fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 and by submitting such
information as the director may require to indicate any material change in the
information contained in the original application or succeeding renewal
applications, including a copy of the licensee's most recent annual audit.
(2) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license at any time by
delivering to the director written notice of the surrender. The department
shall cancel the license following such surrender.
(3) If a licensee fails to renew its license and does not voluntarily
surrender the license pursuant to this section, the department may issue a
notice of expiration of the license to the licensee in lieu of revocation
proceedings.
Sec. 70. (1) Except as provided in section 45-350 and subsection (6) of
this section, every installment loan licensee may make loans and may contract
for and receive on such loans charges at a rate not exceeding twenty-four
percent per annum on that part of the unpaid principal balance on any loan not
in excess of one thousand dollars, and twenty-one percent per annum on any
remainder of such unpaid principal balance. Except for loans secured by mobile
homes, an installment loan licensee may not make loans for a period in excess
of one hundred forty-five months if the amount of the loan is greater than
three thousand dollars but less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Unless
otherwise allowed for by law, charges on loans made under the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act shall not be paid, deducted, or received in
advance. The contracting for, charging of, or receiving of charges as provided
for in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed to be the payment,
deduction, or receipt of such charges in advance.
(2) When the loan contract requires repayment in substantially equal and
consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined, the
installment loan licensee may, at the time the loan is made, precompute the
charges at the agreed rate on scheduled unpaid principal balances according to
the terms of the contract and add such charges to the principal of the loan.
Every payment may be applied to the combined total of principal and precomputed
charges until the contract is fully paid. All payments made on account of any
loan except for default and deferment charges shall be deemed to be applied to
the unpaid installments in the order in which the unpaid installments are due.
The portion of the precomputed charges applicable to any particular month of
the contract, as originally scheduled or following a deferment, shall be that
proportion of such precomputed charges, excluding any adjustment made for a
first installment period of more than one month and any adjustment made for
deferment, which the balance of the contract scheduled to be outstanding during
such month bears to the sum of all monthly balances originally scheduled to be
outstanding by the contract. This section shall not limit or restrict the
manner of calculating charges, whether by way of add-on, single annual rate, or
otherwise, if the rate of charges does not exceed what is permitted by this
section. Charges may be contracted for and earned at a single annual rate,
except that the total charges from such rate shall not be greater than the
total charges from the several rates otherwise applicable to the different
portions of the unpaid balance according to subsection (1) of this section. All
loan contracts made pursuant to this subsection are subject to the following
adjustments:
(a) Notwithstanding the requirement for substantially equal and
consecutive monthly installments, the first installment period may not exceed
one month by more than twenty-one days and may not fall short of one month by
more than eleven days. The charges for each day exceeding one month shall be
one-thirtieth of the charges which would be applicable to a first installment
period of one month. The charge for extra days in the first installment period
may be added to the first installment and such charges for such extra days
shall be excluded in computing any rebate;
(b) If prepayment in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise occurs before
the first installment due date, the charges shall be recomputed at the rate of
charges contracted for in accordance with this section upon the actual unpaid
principal balance of the loan for the actual time outstanding by applying the
payment, or payments, first to charges at the agreed rate and the remainder to
the principal. The amount of charges so computed shall be retained in lieu of
all precomputed charges;
(c) If a contract is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise
after the first installment due date, the borrower shall receive a rebate of an
amount which is not less than the amount obtained by applying to the unpaid
principal balances as originally scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for
the period following prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of
-49-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
charge contracted for in accordance with this section. The licensee may round
the rate of charge to the nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is
not consistently used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be
permitted. Any default and deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be
deducted from any rebate. No rebate shall be required for any partial
prepayment. No rebate of less than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the
maturity of the contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is
obtained before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be
reduced by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
date judgment is obtained;
(d) If any installment on a precomputed or interest-bearing loan is unpaid
in full for ten or more consecutive days, Sundays and holidays included, after
it is due, the licensee may charge and collect a default charge not exceeding
an amount equal to five percent of such installment. If any installment payment
is made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is not honored because
of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason except an error of a
third party to the loan contract, the licensee may charge and collect a
fifteen-dollar bad check charge. Such default or bad check charges may be
collected when due or at any time thereafter;
(e) If, as of an installment due date, the payment date of all wholly
unpaid installments is deferred one or more full months and the maturity of the
contract is extended for a corresponding period, the licensee may charge and
collect a deferment charge not exceeding the charge applicable to the first of
the installments deferred, multiplied by the number of months in the deferment
period. The deferment period is that period during which no payment is made or
required by reason of such deferment. The deferment charge may be collected at
the time of deferment or at any time thereafter. The portion of the precomputed
charges applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following
the deferment period shall remain the same as that applicable to such balance
and periods under the original loan contract. No installment on which a default
charge has been collected, or on account of which any partial payment has been
made, shall be deferred or included in the computation of the deferment charge
unless such default charge or partial payment is refunded to the borrower or
credited to the deferment charge. Any payment received at the time of deferment
may be applied first to the deferment charge and the remainder, if any, applied
to the unpaid balance of the contract, except that if such payment is
sufficient to pay, in addition to the appropriate deferment charge, any
installment which is in default and the applicable default charge, it shall be
first so applied and any such installment shall not be deferred or subject to
the deferment charge. If a loan is prepaid in full during the deferment period,
the borrower shall receive, in addition to the required rebate, a rebate of
that portion of the deferment charge applicable to any unexpired full month or
months of such deferment period; and
(f) If two or more full installments are in default for one full month or
more at any installment date and if the contract so provides, the installment
loan licensee may reduce the contract balance by the rebate which would be
required for prepayment in full as of such installment date and the amount
remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be the unpaid principal balance and
thereafter in lieu of charging, collecting, receiving, and applying charges as
provided in this subsection, charges may be charged, collected, received, and
applied at the agreed rate as otherwise provided by this section until the loan
is fully paid.
(3) The charges, as referred to in subsection (1) of this section, shall
not be compounded. The charging, collecting, and receiving of charges as
provided in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed compounding. If
part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is the unpaid principal
balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount payable under such loan
contract may include any unpaid charges on the prior loan which have accrued
within sixty days before the making of such loan contract and may include the
balance remaining after giving the rebate required by subsection (2) of this
section. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, charges shall
(a) be computed and paid only as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal
balance or portions thereof and (b) be computed on the basis of the number of
days actually elapsed. For purposes of computing charges, whether at the
maximum rate or less, a month shall be that period of time from any date in a
month to the corresponding date in the next month but if there is no such
corresponding date then to the last day of the next month, and a day shall be
considered one-thirtieth of a month when computation is made for a fraction of
a month.
(4) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, in
addition to that provided for under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act, no further or other amount whatsoever shall be directly or indirectly
charged, contracted for, or received. If any amount, in excess of the charges
permitted, is charged, contracted for, or received, the loan contract shall not
on that account be void, but the installment loan licensee shall have no right
to collect or receive any interest or other charges whatsoever. If such
interest or other charges have been collected or contracted for, the licensee
shall refund to the borrower all interest and other charges collected and shall
not collect any interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter due on
the loan involved, as liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or
its assignee, if found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating
thereto, including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee
shall be found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of
-50-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to
avoid any such error.
(5) A borrower may be required to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with the making, closing, disbursing, extending, readjusting, or
renewing of loans. Such expenses may include abstracting, recording, releasing,
and registration fees; premiums paid for nonfiling insurance; premiums paid on
insurance policies covering tangible personal property securing the loan;
amounts charged for a debt cancellation contract or a debt suspension contract,
as agreed upon by the parties, if the debt cancellation contract or debt
suspension contract is a contract of a financial institution or installment
loan licensee and such contract is sold directly by such financial institution
or licensee or by an unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent of such financial
institution or licensee in accordance with 12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part
existed on January 1, 2025, and the financial institution or installment loan
licensee is responsible for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent's compliance
with such part; title examinations; credit reports; survey; taxes or charges
imposed upon or in connection with the making and recording or releasing of any
mortgage; amounts charged for a guaranteed asset protection waiver; and fees
and expenses charged for electronic title and lien services. Except as provided
in subsection (6) of this section, a borrower may also be required to pay a
nonrefundable loan origination fee not to exceed the lesser of five hundred
dollars or an amount equal to seven percent of that part of the original
principal balance of any loan not in excess of two thousand dollars and five
percent on that part of the original principal balance in excess of two
thousand dollars, if the installment loan licensee has not made another loan to
the borrower within the previous twelve months. If the licensee has made
another loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months, a nonrefundable
loan origination fee may only be charged on new funds advanced on each
successive loan. Such reasonable initial charges may be collected from the
borrower or included in the principal balance of the loan at the time the loan
is made and shall not be considered interest or a charge for the use of the
money loaned.
(6)(a) Loans secured solely by real property that are not made pursuant to
subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property shall not be subject to
the limitations on the rate of interest provided in subsection (1) of this
section or the limitations on the nonrefundable loan origination fee under
subsection (5) of this section if (i) the principal amount of the loan is seven
thousand five hundred dollars or more and (ii) the sum of the principal amount
of the loan and the balances of all other liens against the property do not
exceed one hundred percent of the appraised value of the property. Acceptable
methods of determining appraised value shall be made by the department pursuant
to rule, regulation, or order.
(b) An origination fee on such loan shall be computed only on the
principal amount of the loan reduced by any portion of the principal that
consists of the amount required to pay off another loan made under this
subsection by the same licensee.
(c) A prepayment penalty on such loan shall be permitted only if (i) the
maximum amount of the penalty to be assessed is stated in writing at the time
the loan is made, (ii) the loan is prepaid in full within two years from the
date of the loan, and (iii) the loan is prepaid with money other than the
proceeds of another loan made by the same licensee. Such prepayment penalty
shall not exceed six months' interest on eighty percent of the original
principal balance computed at the agreed rate of interest on the loan.
(d) An installment loan licensee making a loan pursuant to this subsection
may obtain an interest in any fixtures attached to such real property and any
insurance proceeds payable in connection with such real property or the loan.
(e) For purposes of this subsection, principal amount of the loan means
the total sum owed by the borrower including, but not limited to, insurance
premiums, loan origination fees, or any other amount that is financed, except
that for purposes of subdivision (6)(b) of this section, loan origination fees
shall not be included in calculating the principal amount of the loan.
Sec. 71. Section 45-350, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-350 (1) Installment loan licensees may charge, contract for, or receive
any amount or rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.03 or 45-101.04 or
section 70 of this act upon any loan or upon any part or all of any aggregate
indebtedness of the same person. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this
section, the charging, contracting for, or receiving of a rate of interest
permitted by section 45-101.04 does not exempt the licensee from compliance
with the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act.
(2)(a) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to subdivision
(4) of section 45-101.04 are not subject to the Nebraska Installment Loan and
Sales Act if such loans are not made on real property.
(b) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to subdivision
(11) of section 45-101.04 on real property are not subject to the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act. An installment loan licensee making such loans
shall comply with and be subject to the Residential Mortgage Licensing Act with
respect to such loans, except that the installment loan licensee shall not be
required to obtain a mortgage banker license under the Residential Mortgage
Licensing Act.
(c) Any mortgage loan originator who works as an employee or independent
agent of an installment loan licensee shall be required to obtain a mortgage
-51-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
loan originator license and shall be subject to the Residential Mortgage
Licensing Act.
(3) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(a) of section 70 of this act, no
installment loan licensee shall enter into any loan contract under the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act under which the borrower agrees to make any
payment of principal more than thirty-six calendar months from the date of
making such contract when the principal balance is not more than three thousand
dollars. Every loan contract precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section
70 of this act shall provide for repayment of principal and charges in
installments which shall be payable at approximately equal periodic intervals
of time and so arranged that no installment is substantially greater in amount
than any preceding installment. When necessary in order to facilitate payment
in accordance with the borrower's principal source of income or when the loan
contract is not precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 70 of this
act, the payment schedule may reduce or omit installment payments. Any loan
contract made in violation of this section, either knowingly or without the
exercise of due care to prevent the violation, shall not on that account be
void, but the licensee has no right to collect or receive any interest or
charges on such loan. If any interest or other charges have been collected or
contracted for, the installment loan licensee shall refund to the borrower all
interest and other charges collected and shall not collect thereafter any
interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter due on the loan
involved, as liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or its
assignee, if found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto,
including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall be
found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of the
evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide
error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid
any such error.
(1) Renewal of a license originally granted under the Nebraska Installment
Sales Act may be denied or a license may be suspended or revoked by the
director on the following grounds: (a) Material misstatement in the application
for license; (b) willful failure to comply with any provision of the Nebraska
Installment Sales Act relating to installment contracts; (c) defrauding any
buyer to the buyer's damage; or (d) fraudulent misrepresentation,
circumvention, or concealment by the licensee through whatever subterfuge or
device of any of the material particulars or the nature thereof required to be
stated or furnished to the buyer under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
(2) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the suspension or
revocation of a license that any officer, director, or trustee of a licensed
association or corporation or any member of a licensed partnership or limited
liability company has so acted or failed to act as would be cause for
suspending or revoking a license to such party as an individual.
(3) No license shall be denied, suspended, or revoked except after hearing
in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The director shall give
the licensee at least ten days' written notice, in the form of an order to show
cause, of the time and place of such hearing by either registered or certified
mail addressed to the principal place of business in this state of such
licensee. Such notice shall contain the grounds of complaint against the
licensee. Any order suspending or revoking such license shall recite the
grounds upon which the same is based. The order shall be entered upon the
records of the director and shall not be effective until after thirty days'
written notice thereof given after such entry forwarded by either registered or
certified mail to the licensee at such principal place of business.
(4) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender of any
license shall not impair or affect the obligation of any lawful installment
contract acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
(5) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender of any
license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts committed before
the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender or affect
liability for any fines which may be levied against the licensee or any of its
officers, directors, shareholders, partners, or members pursuant to the
Nebraska Installment Sales Act for acts committed before the revocation,
suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender.
(6) Any person, licensee, or applicant considering himself or herself
aggrieved by an order of the director entered under the provisions of this
section may appeal the order. The appeal shall be in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure Act.
Sec. 72. Section 45-351, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-351 (1) Except as otherwise provided by the Nebraska Installment Loan
and Sales Act or other law, an installment loan licensee shall not contact any
individual who is not living, residing, or present in the household of the
borrower regarding the borrower's obligation to pay a debt, other than the
borrower's spouse, the borrower's attorney, another creditor, or a credit
reporting agency.
(2) The borrower may waive the benefits of this section at any time by
giving consent if such consent is given at a time subsequent to the date the
debt arises.
(1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in the business of a
sales finance company subject to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act. The
-52-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
director shall have the power to appoint examiners who shall, under his or her
direction, investigate the installment contracts and business and examine the
books and records of licensees when the director shall so determine. Such
examinations shall not be conducted more often than annually except as provided
in subsection (2) of this section.
(2) The director or his or her duly authorized representative shall have
the power to make such investigations as he or she shall deem necessary, and to
the extent necessary for this purpose, he or she may examine such licensee or
any other person and shall have the power to compel the production of all
relevant books, records, accounts, and documents.
(3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the books
and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set forth in
sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of an investigation
of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs shall be paid within
thirty days after receipt of billing.
(4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or inquiry
request for information from the department, the licensee shall respond within
twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to respond as required by
this subsection shall constitute a separate violation.
(5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has willfully
and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act,
any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated under the act, or any order
issued by the director under the act, the director may order such person to pay
(a) an administrative fine of not more than one thousand dollars for each
separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation. The department shall
remit fines collected under this subsection to the State Treasurer for
distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the Constitution of
Nebraska.
(6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien in the
amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of
such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the
director. The lien shall attach to the real property of such person when notice
of the lien is filed and indexed against the real property in the office of the
register of deeds in the county where the real property is located. The lien
shall attach to any other property of such person when notice of the lien is
filed against the property in the manner prescribed by law. Failure of the
person to pay such fine and costs shall constitute a separate violation of the
Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
Sec. 73. Section 45-352, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-352 (1) Section 45-351 shall not prohibit the licensee from:
(a) Contacting any person in order to discover property belonging to the
borrower that may be seized to satisfy a debt that has been reduced to
judgment;
(b) Making amicable demand and filing suit on the debt; or
(c) Contacting persons related to the borrower if permission is
specifically given in writing at the time the debt arises or at any time after
such debt arises.
(2) An installment loan licensee may contact any person without the
borrower's consent:
(a) To ascertain information relating to a borrower's credit worthiness,
credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal
characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or
collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in
establishing the borrower's eligibility for credit or insurance if such
contacts are not designed to collect a delinquent debt; or
(b) To locate the borrower when the licensee has reason to believe the
borrower has changed his or her employment or has moved from his or her last-
known address.
The director shall have the power to make such general rules and
regulations and specific rulings, demands, and findings as may be necessary for
the proper conduct of the business licensed under the Nebraska Installment
Sales Act, and the enforcement of the act, in addition thereto and not
inconsistent therewith.
Sec. 74. Section 45-353, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
45-353 (1) An agreement of the parties to a loan, with respect to default
on the part of the borrower, is enforceable only to the extent that:
(a) The borrower fails to make a payment on the loan or other charges
required by the agreement; or
(b) The prospect of payment, performance, or realization of collateral is
significantly impaired. The burden of establishing the prospect of significant
impairment is on the installment loan licensee.
(2) If the borrower has defaulted on his or her promise to pay and if he
or she has given specific notice in writing, by registered or certified mail,
instructing the licensee to cease further contacts with the borrower in regard
to the indebtedness, the installment loan licensee shall, after such notice,
except as provided in section 45-352, limit contacts to one notice per month by
mail. No notice shall be designed to threaten action not otherwise permitted by
law.
(3) With respect to a loan, after a borrower has been in default for ten
-53-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
days for failure to make a required payment, an installment loan licensee may
give the borrower the notice described in this section. An installment loan
licensee gives notice to the borrower under this section when it delivers the
notice to the borrower or delivers or mails the notice to the last-known
address of the borrower's residence.
(4) The notice shall be in writing and shall conspicuously state:
(a) The name, address, and telephone number of the installment loan
licensee to which payment is to be made;
(b) A brief identification of the loan;
(c) The borrower's right to cure the default;
(d) The amount of payment and date by which payment must be made to cure
the default; and
(e) That any credit insurance issued in connection with the loan contract
may be canceled unless the borrower cures the default.
(5) With respect to a loan, after a default consisting only of the
borrower's failure to make a required payment, an installment loan licensee may
neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the obligation nor take
possession of collateral, except voluntarily surrendered collateral, because of
such default until twenty days after a notice of the borrower's right to cure
is given. The borrower shall have twenty days after the notice is given to cure
any default consisting of a failure to make the required payment by tendering
the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without
acceleration, plus any unpaid charges. Cure restores the borrower to his or her
rights under the agreement as though the default had not occurred.
(6) With respect to defaults on the same obligation after an installment
loan licensee has once given a notice of the borrower's right to cure, the
borrower shall have no further right to cure and the installment loan licensee
has no obligation to proceed against the borrower or the collateral.
(7) Upon default by a borrower with respect to a loan, unless the borrower
voluntarily surrenders possession of the collateral to the licensee, the
licensee may take possession of the collateral without judicial process only if
possession can be taken without entry into a dwelling or a locked, unoccupied
motor vehicle, and without the use of force or other breach of the peace.
(1) Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any person
is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate any of the provisions
of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act, he or she may, in addition to all
actions provided for in the act and without prejudice thereto, enter an order
requiring such person to desist or to refrain from such violation. An action
may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney General or the director,
to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from
doing any act or acts in furtherance thereof.
(2) In any such action an order or judgment may be entered awarding such
preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition to all
other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining order or
injunction, the court, in which such action is brought, shall have power and
jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the property and business of
the defendant, including books, papers, documents, and records pertaining
thereto or so much thereof as the court may deem reasonably necessary to

the use of such property and business. Such receiver, when so appointed and
qualified, shall have such powers and duties as to custody, collection,
administration, winding up and liquidation of such property and business as
shall, from time to time, be conferred upon him or her by the court.
Sec. 75. Section 45-354, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
45-354 (1) A borrower is not liable for a deficiency unless the licensee
has disposed of the collateral in good faith and in a commercially reasonable
manner.
(2) If the installment loan licensee takes possession or voluntarily
accepts surrender of goods in which the licensee has a security interest to
secure a loan and at the time thereof the unpaid balance due on the loan is
three thousand dollars or less, the borrower is not personally liable to the
installment loan licensee for the unpaid balance of the debt arising from the
loan and the licensee's duty to dispose of the collateral is governed by the
provisions on disposition of collateral, article 9, Uniform Commercial Code.
(3) The borrower may be liable in damages to the installment loan licensee
if the borrower has wrongfully damaged the collateral or if, after default,
failure to cure, and demand, the borrower has wrongfully failed to make the
collateral available to the installment loan licensee.
(4) If the installment loan licensee elects to bring an action against the
borrower for a debt arising from a loan, when under this section the
installment loan licensee would not be entitled to a deficiency judgment if the
installment loan licensee took possession of the collateral, and obtains
judgment, (a) the installment loan licensee may not take possession of the
collateral and (b) the collateral is not subject to levy or sale on execution
or similar proceedings pursuant to the judgment.

the department shall require such licensees under the act to be licensed and
registered through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. In
order to carry out this requirement, the department is authorized to
participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. For this
-54-

to read:
45-355 (1) No individual, other than the spouse of the borrower, is

additional thirty days if, in his or her judgment, any material information
submitted is substantially inaccurate or the acquiring party has not furnished

(3) An acquisition may become effective prior to the expiration of the

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
obtained judgment, the licensee shall be permitted to resume contacts with the
borrower against whom judgment has been obtained.
Sec. 80. (1) The following types of insurance or one or more of the
following types of insurance may be written in connection with loans made by

(e) Life, health, and accident insurance or any of them, except that the
amount of such insurance shall not exceed the total amount to be repaid under
the loan contract and the term shall not extend beyond the final maturity date
of the loan contract. In the event of a renewal of a loan contract, this type
of insurance shall be canceled and a refund of the unearned premium credited or

loan. Such insurance shall not be required as a condition precedent to the
making of such loan.
(2) In addition to the types of insurance written under subsection (1) of
this section by licensees under the act, any other type of insurance or motor
club service as defined in section 44-3707 may be provided for the benefit of a
licensee's borrower or the borrower's immediate family whether or not in
connection with a loan, except that such insurance or motor club service shall
not be required as a condition precedent to the making of any loan. Nothing in
this subsection alters or eliminates any insurance licensing requirements or

(3) Notwithstanding section 70 of this act and section 45-350, any gain or
advantage, in the form of commission or otherwise, to the licensee or to any
employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee from such insurance or motor
club service or the sale thereof shall not be deemed to be an additional or
further charge in connection with the loan contract. The insurance premium or
motor club service contract fee may be collected from the borrower or financed
through the loan contract at the time the loan is made.
(4)(a) Insurance permitted under this section shall be obtained through a
duly licensed insurance agent, agency, or broker. Premiums shall not exceed

Club Services Act.
(5) In the event of a renewal of a loan contract, any insurance or motor
club service sold pursuant to this section shall be canceled and (a) a refund
of the unearned premium or motor club service contract fee credited or made
before new insurance or motor club service of the same type as that being
canceled may be rewritten or (b) the holder of the loan contract shall send
notice to the buyer within fifteen business days after cancellation of the
name, address, and telephone number of the insurance company or motor club
which issued the insurance contract or motor club service contract or the party
responsible for any refund and notice that the buyer may be eligible for a
refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of the loan
contract.
(6) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this section
is canceled or the premium or motor club service contract fee adjusted during
the term of the loan contract, any refund of the insurance premium or motor
club service contract fee plus the unearned interest thereon received by the
holder shall be credited by the holder to the loan contract or otherwise
refunded, except to the extent applied toward payment for similar insurance or
motor club service protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder or
either of them.
(7) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this section
is canceled due to the payment of all sums for which the buyer is liable under
a loan contract, the holder of the loan contract shall, upon receipt of payment
of all sums due, send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days after
payment of the sums due of the name, address, and telephone number of the
insurance company or motor club which issued the insurance contract or motor
club service contract or the party responsible for any refund and notice that
the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained
by the holder of the loan contract. This subsection does not apply if the
holder of the loan contract previously credited the refund of the insurance
premium or motor club service contract fee to the loan contract or otherwise
refunded the insurance premium or motor club service contract fee to the buyer.
(8) The licensee shall, at the time the loan is made, give to the
borrower, or if more than one, to one of them, a statement concerning any
insurance procured by or through the licensee, which includes the amount of any
premium which the borrower has paid or is obligated to pay, the expiration date
of the policy, and a concise description of the risks insured. If a borrower
-57-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
procures insurance by or through a licensee, the licensee shall deliver to the
borrower within fifteen days after the making of the loan an executed copy of
the insurance policy or certificate of insurance.
Sec. 81. (1) Licensees holding an active installment loan license may
make preauthorized loans. Preauthorized loan means a loan made by a licensee
pursuant to an agreement between the licensee and the borrower whereby:
(a) The licensee may permit the borrower to obtain advances of money from
the licensee from time to time or the licensee may advance money on behalf of
the borrower from time to time as directed by the borrower;
(b) The amount of each advance and permitted charge and cost is debited to
the borrower's account and payments and other credits are credited to the same
account;
(c) The charges are computed on the unpaid principal balance or balances
of the account from time to time;
(d) The borrower has the privilege of paying the account in full at any
time or, if the account is not in default, in monthly installments or fixed or
determinable amounts as provided in the agreement; and
(e) The loan agreement expressly states that it covers preauthorized
loans. Preauthorized loan does not mean a transaction, resulting in either a
credit or a debit to the borrower's account, which is initiated by the use or
application of a plastic, metal, or other type of credit or transaction card.
(2) For purposes of computations relating to preauthorized loans made
pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, billing cycle means
the time interval between periodic billing dates. A billing cycle shall be
considered monthly if the closing date of the cycle is the same date each month
or does not vary by more than four days from such date.
Sec. 82. (1) A licensee may make preauthorized loans and may contract for
and receive charges on such loans as set forth in subsection (1) of section 70
of this act, subject to the following requirements:
(a) A licensee shall not compound charges by adding any unpaid charges
authorized by section 70 of this act or this section to the unpaid principal
balance of the borrower's account, except that the unpaid principal balance may
include additional charges for credit life insurance or credit disability
insurance provided in connection with the preauthorized loan, subject to the
requirements and restrictions contained in section 83 of this act;
(b) Charges authorized by section 70 of this act or this section shall be
deemed not to exceed the maximum charges permitted by such sections if such
charges are computed in each billing cycle by any of the following methods:
(i) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the daily unpaid
principal balance of the account, in which case each daily rate is determined
by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by twelve and dividing by three
hundred sixty-five;
(ii) By multiplying each graduated monthly rate by the applicable portion
of the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing
cycle, in which case the average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of
the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in
the cycle; or
(iii) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the average daily
unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in which case
each daily rate is determined by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by
twelve and dividing by three hundred sixty-five, and the average daily unpaid
principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle
divided by the number of days in the cycle; and
(c) For each method of computation set forth in this section, the billing
cycle shall be monthly and the unpaid principal balance on any day shall be
determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the beginning of that day all
advances and other permissible amounts charged to the borrower and deducting
all payments and other credits made or received that day.
(2) The borrower under a preauthorized loan may at any time pay all or any
part of the unpaid balance in his or her account, or, if the account is not in
default, the borrower may pay the unpaid principal balance in monthly
installments. Minimum monthly payment requirements shall be determined by the
licensee and set forth in the preauthorized loan agreement, except that the
minimum monthly payment shall not be less than one and one-half percent of the
average daily unpaid principal balance of an account having an average daily
balance of more than three thousand dollars nor less than two percent of the
average daily unpaid principal balance of an account having an average daily
balance of three thousand dollars or less.
(3) A licensee may retain any security interest, including a mortgage on
real property, until the preauthorized account is terminated.
(4) Subsection (4) of section 45-345, subsection (3) of section 45-350,
and section 78 of this act shall not apply to preauthorized loans.
(5) The department may approve record-keeping systems for licensees and
may prescribe policies and procedures necessary to the administration of
preauthorized loans made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
Act.
Sec. 83. In addition to the charges permitted under section 82 of this
act, a licensee may contract for and receive the fees, costs, and expenses
permitted by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act on other loans,
subject to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in the act with the
following variations:
-58-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
(1) If credit life or disability insurance is provided and if the insured
dies or becomes disabled when there is an outstanding preauthorized loan
indebtedness, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay the total balance of the
loan due on the date of the borrower's death or the amount due as of the end of
the previous billing cycle, whichever is less, in the case of credit life
insurance, or all minimum payments which become due on the loan during the
covered period of disability in the case of credit disability insurance. The
additional charge for credit life insurance or credit disability insurance
shall be calculated in each billing cycle by applying the current monthly
premium rate for such insurance, as such rate may be determined by the Director
of Insurance, to the unpaid balances in the borrower's account, using either of
the methods specified in section 82 of this act for the calculation of loan
charges;
(2) No credit life or disability insurance written in connection with a
preauthorized loan shall be canceled by the licensee because of delinquency of
the borrower in the making of the required minimum payments on the loan unless
one or more of such payments is past due for a period of ninety days or more,
and the licensee shall advance to the insurer the amounts required to keep the
insurance in force during such period, which amounts may be debited to the
borrower's account;
(3) The department may, by rule and regulation or order, require a
statement of insurance that will be appropriate for preauthorized loans in lieu
of that required by section 80 of this act; and
(4) The amount, terms, and conditions of any insurance against loss or
damage to property must be reasonable in relation to the character and value of
the property insured and the maximum anticipated amount of credit to be
extended.
Sec. 84. (1) For purposes of this section, reverse-mortgage loan means a
loan made by a licensee which (a) is secured by residential real estate, (b) is
nonrecourse to the borrower except in the event of fraud by the borrower or
waste to the residential real estate given as security for the loan, (c)
provides cash advances to the borrower based upon the equity in the borrower's
owner-occupied principal residence, (d) requires no payment of principal or
interest until the entire loan becomes due and payable, and (e) otherwise
complies with the terms of this section.
(2) Reverse-mortgage loans shall be governed by the following rules
without regard to the requirements set out elsewhere for other types of
mortgage transactions: (a) Payment in whole or in part is permitted without
penalty at any time during the period of the loan; (b) an advance and interest
on the advance have priority over a lien filed after the closing of a reverse-
mortgage loan; (c) an interest rate may be fixed or adjustable and may also
provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the value of the
residential real estate; and (d) the advance shall not be reduced in amount or
number based on an adjustment in the interest rate when a reverse-mortgage loan
provides for periodic advances to a borrower.
(3) Reverse-mortgage loans may be made or acquired without regard to the
following provisions for other types of mortgage transactions: (a) Limitations
on the purpose and use of future advances or any other mortgage proceeds; (b)
limitations on future advances to a term of years or limitations on the term of
credit line advances; (c) limitations on the term during which future advances
take priority over intervening advances; (d) requirements that a maximum
mortgage amount be stated in the mortgage; (e) limitations on loan-to-value
ratios; (f) prohibitions on balloon payments; (g) prohibitions on compounded

(4) A licensee may, in connection with a reverse-mortgage loan, charge to
the borrower (a) a nonrefundable loan origination fee which does not exceed two
percent of the appraised value of the owner-occupied principal residence at the
time the loan is made, (b) a reasonable fee paid to third parties originating
loans on behalf of the licensee, and (c) such other fees as are necessary and
required, including fees for inspections, insurance, appraisals, and surveys.
(5) Licensees failing to make loan advances as required in the loan
documents and failing to cure the default as required in the loan documents
shall forfeit an amount equal to the greater of two hundred dollars or one
percent of the amount of the loan advance the licensee failed to make.

(4) If a seller proffers an installment sales contract as part of a
transaction which delays or cancels, or promises to delay or cancel, the
payment of the time-price differential on the contract if the buyer pays the
basic time price, cash price, or cash sale price within a certain period of

considered interest or a time-price differential.
(c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act prohibits a
seller or holder of an installment sales contract from contracting for,
computing, and charging a time-price differential based upon the application of
the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number of days
actually elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used for the purpose of
calculating the time-price differential, the time-price balance, the amount of
each installment, and the time-sale price.
(d) When the installment sales contract is payable in substantially equal
and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential shall be
computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined under section
85 of this act, from the date of the contract until the due date of the final
installment, notwithstanding that the time-price balance is required to be paid
-60-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
in installments.
(2) When an installment sales contract provides for payment other than in
substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price
differential may be at a rate which will provide the same return as is
permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts under subdivision
(1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the schedule of payments.
(3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide for
payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each installment
or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall be determined.
Sec. 87. (1) The amount, if any, included for insurance, which may be
purchased by the holder of the contract, shall not exceed the applicable
premium rates chargeable in accordance with filings, if any, with the
Department of Insurance. If dual interest insurance on the goods is purchased
by the holder, it shall, within thirty days after execution of the installment
sales contract, send or cause to be sent to the buyer a policy or policies or
certificate of insurance, written by an insurance company authorized to do
business in this state, clearly setting forth the amount of the premium, the
kind or kinds of insurance, the coverages, and all the terms and conditions of
the contract or contracts of insurance.
(2) If any insurance is canceled or the premium adjusted during the term
of the installment sales contract, any refund of the insurance premium plus the
unearned time-price differential thereon received by the holder shall be
credited by the holder to the last maturing installment of the contract except
to the extent applied toward payment for similar insurance protecting the
interests of the buyer and the holder or either of them.
(3) If any insurance is canceled due to the payment of all sums for which
the buyer is liable under an installment sales contract, the holder of the
installment sales contract shall, upon receipt of payment of all sums due, send
notice to the buyer within fifteen business days of the name, address, and
telephone number of the insurance company which issued the insurance contract
or the party responsible for any refund, and notice that the buyer may be
eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of
the installment sales contract. This subsection does not apply if the holder of
the loan contract previously credited the refund of the insurance premium to
the loan contract or otherwise refunded the insurance premium to the buyer.
(4) The holder may also purchase nonfiling insurance and charge a
reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges
prescribed by law which would have been paid to public officials for filing,
perfecting, releasing, and satisfying any lien or security interest in the
goods or services.
Sec. 88. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the
contrary, any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the
obligation of any contract.
(2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall receive a
rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount obtained by
applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or, if
deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according to the
actuarial method, the rate of the time-price differential previously stated to
the borrower. The licensee may round the rate of the time-price differential to
the nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently used
to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and
deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less than one
dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the contract shall not in
itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained before the final installment
date, the contract balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be
required for prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained.
Sec. 89. (1) Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods or
services from a seller from whom such buyer has previously purchased goods or
services under one or more installment sales contracts and the amounts under
such contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price thereof have not
been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may be included in and consolidated
with one or more of the prior contract or contracts. A memorandum of such
additional purchases shall be prepared by the seller and inserted in or
attached to the seller's counterpart of the contract and shall set forth:
(a) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the
additional goods or services sold and all the information with respect to the
additional purchase required by section 85 of this act to be included in an
installment sales contract;
(b) The consolidated time-price balance to be paid by the buyer; and
(c) The revised payments.
(2) A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as provided
in and subject to section 85 of this act. When such subsequent purchases are
made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such subsequent purchases
shall be deemed to have been applied on previous purchases.
(3) Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment sales
contract shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases in the
same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the various
purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred payment is
increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the subsequent payments,
at the seller's option, may be deemed to be allocated as follows: An amount
equal to the original installment payment to the previous purchase, the balance
-61-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
to the subsequent purchase. The amount of any initial payment or downpayment on
the subsequent purchase shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent
purchase. This section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or
other merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or to
repairs or services in connection therewith rendered by the seller at the
buyer's request.
Sec. 90. (1) An installment sales contract may provide and the holder
thereof may collect, in addition to any time-price differential, a delinquency
charge on each installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen
days, if provided for in the contract, not in excess of five percent of each
installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu thereof,
interest after maturity on each such installment not exceeding the highest
permissible contract rate. If the time-price differential is computed by
application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number
of days actually elapsed, such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent
of each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any
installment payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is
not honored because of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason
except an error of a third party to the contract, the holder may charge and
collect a fee of not more than fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such
fee may be collected when due or at any time thereafter.
(2) When an installment sales contract is for a commercial or business
purpose (a) a delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of each unpaid
installment may be contracted for and received and (b) the holder of any check
or draft or similar order which is not honored for any reason, except for error
of a third party, may charge and collect a fee as stated in the contract. As
used in this section, commercial or business purpose means primarily for a
purpose other than a personal, family, or household purpose.
Sec. 91. The holder of a retail installment sales contract may, upon
agreement with the buyer:
(1) Extend the scheduled due date or defer the scheduled payment of any
installment payment under the retail installment sales contract; and
(2) Charge and collect a reasonable flat service fee for such extension or
deferment in addition to the time-price differential calculated for the period
of such extension or deferment at the rate originally agreed upon in the retail
installment sales contract on the outstanding balance.
Sec. 92. (1) If any seller or sales finance company, in the making or
collection of an installment sales contract, shall, directly or indirectly,
contract for, take, or receive charges in excess of those authorized by the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act except as a result of an accidental and
bona fide error, such contract shall be void and uncollectible as to (a) all of
the excessive portion of the time-price differential, (b) the first one
thousand dollars of the time-price differential authorized by section 86 of
this act, and (c) the first four thousand dollars of the principal of the
contract.
(2) If any seller or sales finance company violates any provision of the
act, other than the violations described in subsection (1) of this section,
except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error, such installment sales
contract shall be void and uncollectible as to the first five hundred dollars
of the time-price differential and the first one thousand dollars of the
principal of such contract. If any of such money has been paid by the buyer,
such buyer or his or her assignee may recover under the act in a civil suit
brought within one year after the due date, or any extension thereof, of the
last installment of the contract.
Sec. 93. (1) A licensee shall not refuse to enter into a loan or impose
finance charges or other terms or conditions of credit more onerous than those
regularly extended by that licensee to borrowers of similar economic
backgrounds because of the age, color, creed, national origin, political
affiliation, race, religion, sex, marital status, or disability of the borrower
or because the borrower receives public assistance, social security benefits,
pension benefits, or the like.
(2) No licensee shall conduct the business of making loans under the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act within any office, room, or place of
business in which any other business is solicited or engaged in, or in
association or conjunction with any other business, if the director finds that
the other business is of such nature that the conducting of such other business
tends to conceal evasion of the act or of the rules and regulations adopted and
promulgated under the act. In such case, the director shall order such licensee
in writing to cease and desist from such conduct.
(3) No licensee shall, directly or indirectly, require a borrower as a
condition of granting a loan to such borrower to reaffirm or otherwise obligate
the borrower to pay a former debt to the licensee which has been discharged in
bankruptcy proceedings.
(4) Any person who makes a false statement to secure a loan is guilty of a
Class III misdemeanor. The punishment shall not be exacted, however, when such
a loan is made after the licensee is aware of the falsity of the statement.
(5) No licensee or other person subject to the Nebraska Installment Loan
and Sales Act shall advertise, print, display, publish, distribute, or
broadcast or cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed, published,
distributed, or broadcast in any manner whatsoever any false, misleading, or
deceptive statement or representation with regard to the rates, terms, or
conditions for the lending of money, credit, goods, or things in action. The
director may order any licensee to cease and desist from any conduct which he
-62-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
or she finds to be a violation of this section. The director may require that
rates of charge, if stated by a licensee, be stated fully and clearly in such
manner as the director deems necessary to prevent misunderstanding by
prospective borrowers.
(6) No loan, made outside this state, in the amount or of the value of
three thousand dollars or less, for which a greater rate of interest,
consideration, or charges than is permitted by section 45-350 has been charged,
contracted for, or received, shall be enforced in this state. Every person
participating in such loan in this state is subject to the Nebraska Installment
Loan and Sales Act, except that the act shall not apply to loans legally made
in any state under and in accordance with a regulatory small loan law similar
in principle to such act.
(7) In connection with the collection of any loan, a licensee may not:
(a) Use or threaten to use violence;
(b) Use obscene or profane language;
(c) Cause a telephone to ring or engage a person in telephone conversation
at times known to be inconvenient to the borrower;
(d) Falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of any debt;

(k) Charge or collect any fees, charges, or expenses, incidental to the
collection of any loan, unless such amount is expressly authorized by the loan
agreement or permitted by law;

less than three business days prior to such deposit;
(m) Solicit any postdated check or other postdated payment instrument for
the purpose of threatening or instituting criminal prosecution;
(n) Deposit or threaten to deposit any postdated check prior to the date

concealment of the true purpose of the communication, including, but not
limited to, collect telephone calls and telegram fees;
(p) Communicate with a borrower regarding a debt by postcard; or
(q) Communicate with a borrower at the borrower's place of employment if
the licensee has received actual notice that the borrower's employer prohibits
the borrower from receiving such communication.
Sec. 94. (1) The department shall require licensees to be licensed and
registered through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. In
order to carry out this requirement, the department is authorized to
participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. For this
purpose, the department may establish, by adopting and promulgating rules and

governmental agency in order to reduce the points of contact which the Federal
Bureau of Investigation may have to maintain for purposes of subsection (1) of
this section.
(8) In order to promote more effective regulation and reduce the
regulatory burden through supervisory information sharing:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements under

information or material provided to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System
and Registry, and any privilege arising under federal or state law, including
the rules of any federal or state court, with respect to such information or
material, shall continue to apply to such information or material after the

System and Registry. Such information and material may be shared with all
federal and state regulatory officials with mortgage industry oversight
authority without the loss of privilege or the loss of confidentiality
protections provided by federal or state law;
(b) Information or material that is subject to a privilege or

Sec. 95. The director may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations and
issue orders, rulings, demands, and findings to carry out the purposes of the
Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act.
Sec. 96. Any person violating subsection (4) of section 45-345, section
70 of this act, section 45-356, or section 80 of this act is guilty of a Class
II misdemeanor. If, in the making of, or collection on, any loan contract, any
act is done which constitutes a Class II misdemeanor under this section, that
loan shall not be void, but the licensee shall have no right to collect or
receive any interest or charges whatsoever. If any interest or other charges
have been collected, the licensee shall forfeit and refund to the borrower all
interest and other charges collected on the loan involved and shall not collect
thereafter any interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter due on
the loan involved, as liquidated damages, and the licensee or its assignee, if
found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto, including
reasonable attorney's fees. No licensee shall be found liable under this
section if the licensee shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the
violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error
-64-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid any
such error.
Sec. 97. Any violation of section 93 of this act, in connection with any
loan transaction, however acquired, shall not render the indebtedness, any
interest, or other charges void or uncollectible. In an action, other than a
class action, the borrower may recover from the licensee violating section 93
of this act an award of liquidated damages in an amount determined by the
court, but not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand
dollars. In any legal action brought pursuant to this section in which the
licensee is found liable, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney's
fees to the borrower. A licensee is not liable under this section if the
licensee notifies the borrower of an error before the licensee receives from
the borrower written notice of the error or before the borrower has brought an
action under this section and the licensee corrects the error within thirty
days after notifying the borrower. A licensee may not be held liable in any
action brought under this section if the licensee shows by a preponderance of
evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide
error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid
the error.
Sec. 98. Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any
person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act, the director may, in addition to any action
provided in the act and without prejudice thereto, enter an order requiring
such person to cease and desist or to refrain from such violation. An action
may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney General and the director,
to enjoin such person from engaging in or continuing such violation or from
doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation. In any such action, an
order or judgment may be entered awarding such preliminary or final injunction
as may be deemed proper. In addition to all other means provided by law for the
enforcement of a restraining order or injunction, the court, in which such
action is brought, has power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver
for the property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court may
deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska Installment
Loan and Sales Act through or by means of the use of such property and
business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, has such powers and
duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up, and liquidation
of such property and business as shall, from time to time, be conferred upon
the receiver by the court.
Sec. 99. (1) The department may order any person to cease and desist
whenever the department determines that the person has violated any provision
of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. Upon entry of a cease and
desist order, the director shall promptly notify the affected person that such
order has been entered, of the reasons for such order, and that upon receipt,
within fifteen business days after the date of the order, of written request
from the affected person a hearing will be scheduled within thirty business
days after the date of receipt of the written request unless the parties
consent to a later date or the hearing officer sets a later date for good
cause. If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the director, the
order shall remain in effect until it is modified or vacated.
(2) The director may vacate or modify a cease and desist order if he or
she finds that the conditions which caused its entry have changed or that it is
otherwise in the public interest to do so.
(3) A person aggrieved by a cease and desist order of the director may
obtain judicial review of the order in the manner prescribed in the
Administrative Procedure Act and the rules and regulations adopted and
promulgated by the department under the act. The director may obtain an order
from the district court of Lancaster County for the enforcement of the cease
and desist order.
(4) A person who violates a cease and desist order of the director may,
after notice and hearing and upon further order of the director, be subject to
a penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each act in violation of
the cease and desist order. The department shall remit fines collected under
this section to the State Treasurer for distribution in accordance with Article
VII, section 5, of the Constitution of Nebraska.
Sec. 100. (1) The director may, following a hearing under the
Administrative Procedure Act, impose an administrative fine against any
officer, director, shareholder, partner, or member of a licensee, if the
director finds the licensee or any such person participated in or had knowledge
of any act prohibited by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act or
otherwise violated the act. Such administrative fine shall be in addition to or
separate from any fine imposed against a licensee pursuant to section 45-346.
(2) If the director finds, after notice and hearing in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has knowingly committed any act
prohibited by section 93 of this act or otherwise violated the Nebraska
Installment Loan and Sales Act or any rule and regulation or order adopted
thereunder, the director may order such person to pay (a) an administrative
fine of not more than five thousand dollars for each separate violation and (b)
the costs of investigation.
(3) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
investigation ordered pursuant to this section, a lien in the amount of such
fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of such person in
this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the director. The lien
-65-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
shall attach to the real property of such person when notice of the lien is
filed and indexed against the real property in the office of the register of
deeds in the county where the real property is located. The lien shall attach
to any other property of such person when notice of the lien is filed against
the property in the manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such
fine and costs shall constitute a separate violation of the act.
(4) The department shall remit fines collected under this section to the
State Treasurer for distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of
the Constitution of Nebraska.
Sec. 101. All original license fees, annual renewal fees, investigation
