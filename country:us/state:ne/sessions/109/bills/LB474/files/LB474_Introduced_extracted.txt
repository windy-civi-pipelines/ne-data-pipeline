-5-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 8-330 Every association may require borrowing members to pay all
2 reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the making, closing,
3 disbursing, extending, readjusting, or renewing of real estate loans.
4 Such expenses may include abstract, recording, and registration fees,
5 title examinations, survey, escrow services, and taxes or charges imposed
6 upon or in connection with the making and recording of any mortgage. Such
7 reasonable charges may be collected by the association from the borrower
8 and shall not be considered interest or a charge for the use of the money
9 loaned. A charge not exceeding one percent or that allowed a federally
10 chartered association for the premature prepayment may be made. The rate
11 of interest on any loan of money shall be determined and computed upon
12 the assumption that the debt will be paid according to the agreed terms
13 and in the event the loan is paid or collected by court action prior to
14 the term of the loan, any payment charged, received, or taken as an
15 advance or forbearance which is in the nature of and taken into account
16 in the calculation of interest, shall be spread over the stated term of
17 the loan for the purpose of determining the rate of interest. Any amounts
18 paid or contracted to be paid by persons other than the borrower shall
19 not be considered interest and shall not be taken into account in the
20 calculation of interest. Interest may be paid on escrow accounts held for
21 the payment of taxes, insurance, and similar payments, if agreed to in
22 writing by the borrower and association. Loans may be made by an
23 association under a license granted it pursuant to the Nebraska
24 Installment Loan and Sales Act, to borrowing members whose loans are
25 secured by real estate, to the same extent and in the same amount as such
26 loans may lawfully be made to nonborrowing members. The association shall
27 furnish a loan settlement statement to each borrower, indicating in
28 detail the charges and fees such borrower has paid or obligated himself
29 or herself to pay to the association or to any other person in connection
30 with such loan. A copy of such statement shall be retained in the records
31 of the association.

5 Sec. 3. Section 8-601, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
6 amended to read:
7 8-601 The Director of Banking and Finance may employ deputies,
8 examiners, attorneys, and other assistants as may be necessary for the
9 administration of the provisions and purposes of the Credit Union Act,
10 Delayed Deposit Services Licensing Act, Interstate Branching and Merger
11 Act, Interstate Trust Company Office Act, Nebraska Bank Holding Company
12 Act of 1995, Nebraska Banking Act, Nebraska Financial Innovation Act,
13 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, Nebraska Installment Sales Act,
14 Nebraska Money Transmitters Act, Nebraska Trust Company Act, and

16 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 24, and 25; and Chapter 45, articles 1 and 2. The
17 director may levy upon financial institutions, namely, the banks, trust
18 companies, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations,
19 savings banks, digital asset depositories, and credit unions, organized
20 under the laws of this state, and holding companies, if any, of such
21 financial institutions, an assessment each year based upon the asset size
22 of the financial institution, except that in determining the asset size
23 of a holding company or digital asset depository, the assets of any
24 financial institution or holding company otherwise assessed pursuant to
25 this section and the assets of any nationally chartered financial
26 institution shall be excluded. The assessment for digital asset
27 depositories under the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act shall be in an
28 amount to offset the costs of supervision and administration of the
29 Nebraska Financial Innovation Act. The assessment shall be a sum
30 determined by the director in accordance with section 8-606 and approved
31 by the Governor.

1 Sec. 4. Section 8-820.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 8-820.01 It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the State
4 of Nebraska that for purposes of applying the federal most-favored-lender
5 doctrine, the bank credit card rate contained in section 8-820 is not
6 comparable or analogous to the small loan rate found in section 23 of
7 this act sections 45-1024 and section 45-350 45-1025. The Legislature
8 finds that the institutions making small loans and the institutions
9 administering a bank credit card are categorically different. The
10 transactions carried on by these institutions are categorically
11 different. The Legislature finds that small loan borrowers and bank
12 credit card users are not synonymous or comparable. In establishing a
13 small loan rate, the Legislature has recognized a risk factor that is
14 different and greater than other financial transactions and therefor
15 justifies the charging of a higher interest rate than installment loans,
16 personal loans, retail revolving credit plans, or bank credit card
17 interest rates.
18 Sec. 5. Section 44-1703, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 44-1703 All life insurance and all accident and health insurance

22 subject to sections 44-1701 to 44-1713 except such insurance sold in
23 connection with a loan or other credit transaction of more than ten years
24 duration or fifteen years duration when made by licensees under the
25 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. No insurance shall be subject to
26 sections 44-1701 to 44-1713 when the issuance of such insurance is an
27 isolated transaction on the part of the insurer and not related to an
28 agreement or a plan for insuring debtors of the creditor.
29 Sec. 6. Section 45-101.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 45-101.04 The limitation on the rate of interest provided in section
-8-

19 pledged as collateral for such repayment and in which such loans or
20 advances are used by the borrower only for the purchase of securities as
21 so defined. It shall be lawful to contract for and receive any rate of
22 interest on such transaction as the parties thereto may expressly agree;
23 (7) Interest charges made on open credit accounts by a person who
24 sells goods or services on credit when the interest charges do not exceed
25 one and one-third percent per month for any charges which remain unpaid
26 for more than thirty days following rendition of the statement of
27 account;
28 (8) A minimum charge of ten dollars per loan which may be charged by
29 the lender in lieu of all interest charges;

19 connection with such real property or the loan;

21 45-702.01;
22 (13) Interest charges made on any goods or services sold under an
23 installment contract pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
24 Act. Subject to section 39 of this act 45-338, it shall be lawful to
25 contract for and receive any rate of interest on such contract as the
26 parties may expressly agree to in writing; or
27 (14) Fees which may be charged by a licensee for services pursuant
28 to the Delayed Deposit Services Licensing Act.

3 notice of cancellation of the license in lieu of revocation proceedings.
4 (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the time-
5 price differential for any goods or services sold under an installment
6 contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual percentage rate
7 and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to exceed eighteen
8 percent per annum, except that a minimum time-price differential of ten
9 dollars may be charged on any installment contract.
10 (b)(i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the
11 installment contract, to pay an origination fee of not to exceed ten
12 dollars, except that if the installment contract is for an installment

25 (c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act prohibits a seller
26 or holder of an installment contract from contracting for, computing, and
27 charging a time-price differential based upon the application of the rate
28 charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually
29 elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used for the purpose of
30 calculating the time-price differential, the time-price balance, the
31 amount of each installment, and the time-sale price.
-30-

5 due date of the final installment, notwithstanding that the time-price
6 balance is required to be paid in installments.
7 (2) When an installment contract provides for payment other than in
8 substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price
9 differential may be at a rate which will provide the same return as is
10 permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts under
11 subdivision (1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the schedule of
12 payments.
13 (3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide
14 for payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each
15 installment or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall
16 be determined.

28 license; and
29 (b) One hundred dollars for an installment sales branch license.

1 under one or more installment contracts and the amounts under such
2 contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price thereof have not

13 (3) The revised payments.
14 A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as

16 subsequent purchases are made, the entire amount of all payments made
17 prior to such subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied
18 on previous purchases.
19 Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment contract
20 shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases in the
21 same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the various
22 purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred payment
23 is increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the subsequent
24 payments, at the seller's option, may be deemed to be allocated as
25 follows: An amount equal to the original installment payment to the
26 previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The amount of
27 any initial payment or downpayment on the subsequent purchase shall be
28 allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase. The provisions of
29 this section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or to
30 other merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or

8 seller and based upon the catalog of the seller or other printed
9 solicitation of business, which is distributed and made available
10 generally to the public, if such catalog or other printed solicitation

10 on each installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen

12 each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu
13 thereof, interest after maturity on each such installment not exceeding
14 the highest permissible contract rate. If the time-price differential is
15 computed by application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal
16 balance for the number of days actually elapsed, such delinquency charge
17 may not exceed five percent of each installment or twenty-five dollars,
18 whichever is less. If any installment payment is made by a check, draft,
19 or similar signed order which is not honored because of insufficient
20 funds, no account, or any other reason except an error of a third party
21 to the contract, the holder may charge and collect a fee of not more than
22 fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such fee may be collected
23 when due or at any time thereafter.

1 Sec. 16. Section 45-342, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 45-342 Any person who, by any device, subterfuge, or pretense
4 whatsoever, engages in or continues any of the kinds of business or
5 enterprise permitted to licensees by the Nebraska Installment Loan and
6 Sales Act without having obtained the license required by the act, with
7 intent to evade the provisions of the act, is guilty of a Class I
8 misdemeanor.
9 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary,
10 any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the obligation
11 of any contract.
12 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
13 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
14 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
15 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
16 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
17 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
18 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
19 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
20 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
21 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
22 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
23 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
24 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
25 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
26 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
27 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
28 date judgment is obtained.

7 of any such hearing shall be paid by the licensee.

2 (5)(a) The director may deny any proposed acquisition if:
3 (i) The financial condition of any acquiring person is such as might
4 jeopardize the financial stability of the acquired licensee;
5 (ii) The character and general fitness of any acquiring person or of
6 any of the proposed management personnel indicate that the acquired
7 installment sales licensee or installment loan licensee would not be
8 operated honestly, fairly, or efficiently within the purposes of the
9 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act; or
10 (iii) Any acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish
11 all information required by the department.
12 (b) The director shall notify the acquiring party in writing of
13 denial of the acquisition. The notice shall provide a statement of the
14 basis for the denial.
15 (c) Within fifteen business days after receipt of written notice of

1 of an accidental and bona fide error, such installment contract shall be
2 void and uncollectible as to the first five hundred dollars of the time-
3 price differential and the first one thousand dollars of the principal of
4 such contract. If any of such money has been paid by the buyer, such
5 buyer or his or her assignee may recover under the act in a civil suit
6 brought within one year after the due date, or any extension thereof, of
7 the last installment of the contract.

2 security of the system and personal information have the same meaning as
3 in section 87-802.
4 (3) A licensee shall maintain the minimum net worth required by
5 section 45-337 while a license issued to the licensee under the Nebraska
6 Installment Loan and Sales Act is in effect. The minimum net worth shall
7 be proven by an annual audit conducted by a certified public accountant.
8 A licensee shall submit a copy of the annual audit to the director as

11 may issue a notice of cancellation of the license in lieu of revocation
12 proceedings.
13 (4)(a) Every licensee shall, at the time any loan is made, give to

22 (1) No person shall act as a sales finance company in this state
23 without obtaining a license therefor from the department as provided in

2 price differential allowed by section 45-338.
3 Sec. 20. Section 45-346, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
4 2024, is amended to read:
5 45-346 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of
6 inspecting the business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage
7 in business activities requiring a license under the Nebraska Installment
8 Loan and Sales Act. The department may examine or investigate complaints
9 about or reports of alleged violations by a licensee made to the
10 department. The director shall have the power to appoint examiners who
11 shall, under the director's direction, investigate the installment sales
12 contracts, installment loans, and business and examine the books and
13 records of licensees when the director shall so determine. Such
14 examinations shall be conducted as often as determined by the director.
15 (2) The director or the director's duly authorized representative
16 shall have the power to make such investigations as the director or
17 authorized representative shall deem necessary, and to the extent
18 necessary for this purpose, the director or authorized representative may
19 examine a licensee or any other person and shall have the power to compel
20 the production of all relevant books, records, accounts, and documents.
21 (3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the
22 books and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set
23 forth in sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of
24 an investigation of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs
25 shall be paid within thirty days after receipt of billing.
26 (4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or
27 inquiry request for information from the department, the licensee shall
28 respond within twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to
29 respond as required by this subsection shall constitute a separate
30 violation.
31 (5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing
-45-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has
2 willfully and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska
3 Installment Loan and Sales Act, any rule or regulation adopted and
4 promulgated under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, or any
5 order issued by the director under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
6 Sales Act, the director may order such person to pay (a) an
7 administrative fine of not more than five thousand dollars for each
8 separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation. The department
9 shall remit fines collected under this subsection to the State Treasurer
10 for distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the
11 Constitution of Nebraska.
12 (6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
13 investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien
14 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
15 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil
16 action by the director. The lien shall attach to the real property of
17 such person when notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real
18 property in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
19 real property is located. The lien shall attach to any other property of
20 such person when notice of the lien is filed against the property in the
21 manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and
22 costs shall constitute a separate violation of the Nebraska Installment
23 Loan and Sales Act.
24 (1) A license issued under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act is
25 nontransferable and nonassignable. The same person may obtain additional
26 licenses for each place of business operating as a sales finance company
27 in this state upon compliance with the act as to each license, except
28 that on or after January 1, 2020, a person is no longer required to
29 obtain a new license for each place of business and may maintain a branch
30 office or offices upon compliance with the act.
31 (2) Application for a license shall be on a form prescribed and
-46-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 furnished by the director and shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
2 the applicant's name and any trade name or doing business as designation
3 which the applicant intends to use in this state, (b) the applicant's
4 main office address, (c) all branch office addresses at which business is
5 to be conducted, (d) the names and titles of each director and principal
6 officer of the applicant, (e) the names of all shareholders, partners, or
7 members of the applicant, (f) a description of the activities of the
8 applicant in such detail as the department may require, (g) if the
9 applicant is an individual, his or her social security number, (h)
10 audited financial statements showing a minimum net worth of one hundred
11 thousand dollars, and (i) background checks as provided in section
12 45-354.
13 (3) An applicant for a license shall file with the department a
14 surety bond in the amount of fifty thousand dollars, furnished by a
15 surety company authorized to do business in this state. Such bond shall
16 be increased by an additional fifty thousand dollars for each branch
17 location of the applicant that is licensed under the Nebraska Installment
18 Sales Act. The bond shall be for the use of the State of Nebraska and any
19 Nebraska resident who may have claims or causes of action against the
20 applicant. The surety may cancel the bond only upon thirty days' written
21 notice to the director.
22 (4) A license fee of one hundred fifty dollars, and, if applicable,
23 a one-hundred-dollar fee for each branch office listed in the
24 application, and any processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of
25 section 45-354 shall be submitted along with each application.
26 (5) An initial license shall remain in full force and effect until
27 the next succeeding December 31. Each license shall remain in force until
28 revoked, suspended, canceled, expired, or surrendered.
29 (6) The director shall, after an application has been filed for a
30 license under the act, investigate the facts, and if he or she finds that
31 the experience, character, and general fitness of the applicant, of the
-47-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 members thereof if the applicant is a corporation or association, and of
2 the officers and directors thereof if the applicant is a corporation, are
3 such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly,
4 fairly, and efficiently within the purpose of the act, the director shall
5 issue and deliver a license to the applicant to do business as a sales
6 finance company in accordance with the license and the act. The director
7 shall have the power to reject for cause any application for a license.
8 (7) The director shall, within his or her discretion, make an
9 examination and inspection concerning the propriety of the issuance of a
10 license to any applicant. The cost of such examination and inspection
11 shall be borne by the applicant.
12 (8) If an applicant for a license under the act does not complete
13 the license application and fails to respond to a notice or notices from
14 the department to correct the deficiency or deficiencies for a period of
15 one hundred twenty days or more after the date the department sends the
16 initial notice to correct the deficiency or deficiencies, the department
17 may deem the application as abandoned and may issue a notice of
18 abandonment of the application to the applicant in lieu of proceedings to
19 deny the application.
20 Sec. 21. Section 45-347, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 45-347 The payment in money, credit, goods, or things in action, as
23 consideration for any sale or assignment of, or order for, the payment of
24 wages, salary, commission, or other compensation for services, whether
25 earned or to be earned, shall, for purposes of regulation under the
26 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, be deemed a loan secured by such
27 assignment, and the amount by which the assigned compensation exceeds the
28 amount of the consideration actually paid, shall, for the purposes of
29 regulation under the act, be deemed interest or charges upon the loan
30 from the date of payment to the date the compensation is payable. Such
31 transaction shall be governed by and be subject to the act.
-48-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 All money collected under the authority of the Nebraska Installment
2 Sales Act shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the
3 Financial Institution Assessment Cash Fund.
4 Sec. 22. Section 45-348, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 45-348 Every installment loan licensee shall permit payment to be
7 made in advance in any amount equal to one or more full installments on
8 any loan contract at any time during regular business hours, but the
9 licensee may apply such payment first to all accrued charges in full up
10 to the date of such payment.
11 (1) An installment sales license may be renewed annually on or
12 before December 31 by paying to the director a fee of one hundred fifty
13 dollars, plus one hundred dollars for each branch office, if applicable,
14 and any processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 and
15 by submitting such information as the director may require to indicate
16 any material change in the information contained in the original
17 application or succeeding renewal applications, including a copy of the
18 licensee's most recent annual audit.
19 (2) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license at any time by
20 delivering to the director written notice of the surrender. The
21 department shall cancel the license following such surrender.
22 (3) If a licensee fails to renew its license and does not
23 voluntarily surrender the license pursuant to this section, the
24 department may issue a notice of expiration of the license to the
25 licensee in lieu of revocation proceedings.
26 Sec. 23. (1) Except as provided in section 45-350 and subsection
27 (6) of this section, every installment loan licensee may make loans and
28 may contract for and receive on such loans charges at a rate not
29 exceeding twenty-four percent per annum on that part of the unpaid
30 principal balance on any loan not in excess of one thousand dollars, and
31 twenty-one percent per annum on any remainder of such unpaid principal
-49-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 balance. Except for loans secured by mobile homes, an installment loan
2 licensee may not make loans for a period in excess of one hundred forty-
3 five months if the amount of the loan is greater than three thousand
4 dollars but less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Unless otherwise
5 allowed for by law, charges on loans made under the Nebraska Installment
6 Loan and Sales Act shall not be paid, deducted, or received in advance.
7 The contracting for, charging of, or receiving of charges as provided for
8 in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed to be the payment,
9 deduction, or receipt of such charges in advance.
10 (2) When the loan contract requires repayment in substantially equal
11 and consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined,
12 the installment loan licensee may, at the time the loan is made,
13 precompute the charges at the agreed rate on scheduled unpaid principal
14 balances according to the terms of the contract and add such charges to
15 the principal of the loan. Every payment may be applied to the combined
16 total of principal and precomputed charges until the contract is fully
17 paid. All payments made on account of any loan except for default and
18 deferment charges shall be deemed to be applied to the unpaid
19 installments in the order in which the unpaid installments are due. The
20 portion of the precomputed charges applicable to any particular month of
21 the contract, as originally scheduled or following a deferment, shall be
22 that proportion of such precomputed charges, excluding any adjustment
23 made for a first installment period of more than one month and any
24 adjustment made for deferment, which the balance of the contract
25 scheduled to be outstanding during such month bears to the sum of all
26 monthly balances originally scheduled to be outstanding by the contract.
27 This section shall not limit or restrict the manner of calculating
28 charges, whether by way of add-on, single annual rate, or otherwise, if
29 the rate of charges does not exceed what is permitted by this section.
30 Charges may be contracted for and earned at a single annual rate, except
31 that the total charges from such rate shall not be greater than the total
-50-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 charges from the several rates otherwise applicable to the different
2 portions of the unpaid balance according to subsection (1) of this
3 section. All loan contracts made pursuant to this subsection are subject
4 to the following adjustments:
5 (a) Notwithstanding the requirement for substantially equal and
6 consecutive monthly installments, the first installment period may not
7 exceed one month by more than twenty-one days and may not fall short of
8 one month by more than eleven days. The charges for each day exceeding
9 one month shall be one-thirtieth of the charges which would be applicable
10 to a first installment period of one month. The charge for extra days in
11 the first installment period may be added to the first installment and
12 such charges for such extra days shall be excluded in computing any
13 rebate;
14 (b) If prepayment in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise occurs
15 before the first installment due date, the charges shall be recomputed at
16 the rate of charges contracted for in accordance with this section upon
17 the actual unpaid principal balance of the loan for the actual time
18 outstanding by applying the payment, or payments, first to charges at the
19 agreed rate and the remainder to the principal. The amount of charges so
20 computed shall be retained in lieu of all precomputed charges;
21 (c) If a contract is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
22 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
23 receive a rebate of an amount which is not less than the amount obtained
24 by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or,
25 if deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according
26 to the actuarial method, the rate of charge contracted for in accordance
27 with this section. The licensee may round the rate of charge to the
28 nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently
29 used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any
30 default and deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted
31 from any rebate. No rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment.
-51-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 No rebate of less than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the
2 maturity of the contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If
3 judgment is obtained before the final installment date, the contract
4 balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be required for
5 prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained;
6 (d) If any installment on a precomputed or interest-bearing loan is
7 unpaid in full for ten or more consecutive days, Sundays and holidays
8 included, after it is due, the licensee may charge and collect a default
9 charge not exceeding an amount equal to five percent of such installment.
10 If any installment payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed
11 order which is not honored because of insufficient funds, no account, or
12 any other reason except an error of a third party to the loan contract,
13 the licensee may charge and collect a fifteen-dollar bad check charge.
14 Such default or bad check charges may be collected when due or at any
15 time thereafter;
16 (e) If, as of an installment due date, the payment date of all
17 wholly unpaid installments is deferred one or more full months and the
18 maturity of the contract is extended for a corresponding period, the
19 licensee may charge and collect a deferment charge not exceeding the
20 charge applicable to the first of the installments deferred, multiplied
21 by the number of months in the deferment period. The deferment period is
22 that period during which no payment is made or required by reason of such
23 deferment. The deferment charge may be collected at the time of deferment
24 or at any time thereafter. The portion of the precomputed charges
25 applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following the
26 deferment period shall remain the same as that applicable to such balance
27 and periods under the original loan contract. No installment on which a
28 default charge has been collected, or on account of which any partial
29 payment has been made, shall be deferred or included in the computation
30 of the deferment charge unless such default charge or partial payment is
31 refunded to the borrower or credited to the deferment charge. Any payment
-52-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 received at the time of deferment may be applied first to the deferment
2 charge and the remainder, if any, applied to the unpaid balance of the
3 contract, except that if such payment is sufficient to pay, in addition
4 to the appropriate deferment charge, any installment which is in default
5 and the applicable default charge, it shall be first so applied and any
6 such installment shall not be deferred or subject to the deferment
7 charge. If a loan is prepaid in full during the deferment period, the
8 borrower shall receive, in addition to the required rebate, a rebate of
9 that portion of the deferment charge applicable to any unexpired full
10 month or months of such deferment period; and
11 (f) If two or more full installments are in default for one full
12 month or more at any installment date and if the contract so provides,
13 the installment loan licensee may reduce the contract balance by the
14 rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of such
15 installment date and the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be
16 the unpaid principal balance and thereafter in lieu of charging,
17 collecting, receiving, and applying charges as provided in this
18 subsection, charges may be charged, collected, received, and applied at
19 the agreed rate as otherwise provided by this section until the loan is
20 fully paid.
21 (3) The charges, as referred to in subsection (1) of this section,
22 shall not be compounded. The charging, collecting, and receiving of
23 charges as provided in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed
24 compounding. If part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is
25 the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount
26 payable under such loan contract may include any unpaid charges on the
27 prior loan which have accrued within sixty days before the making of such
28 loan contract and may include the balance remaining after giving the
29 rebate required by subsection (2) of this section. Except as provided in
30 subsection (2) of this section, charges shall (a) be computed and paid
31 only as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal balance or
-53-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 portions thereof and (b) be computed on the basis of the number of days
2 actually elapsed. For purposes of computing charges, whether at the
3 maximum rate or less, a month shall be that period of time from any date
4 in a month to the corresponding date in the next month but if there is no
5 such corresponding date then to the last day of the next month, and a day
6 shall be considered one-thirtieth of a month when computation is made for
7 a fraction of a month.
8 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section,
9 in addition to that provided for under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
10 Sales Act, no further or other amount whatsoever shall be directly or
11 indirectly charged, contracted for, or received. If any amount, in excess
12 of the charges permitted, is charged, contracted for, or received, the
13 loan contract shall not on that account be void, but the installment loan
14 licensee shall have no right to collect or receive any interest or other
15 charges whatsoever. If such interest or other charges have been collected
16 or contracted for, the licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest
17 and other charges collected and shall not collect any interest or other
18 charges contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as
19 liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if
20 found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto,
21 including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall
22 be found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of
23 the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a
24 bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
25 adopted to avoid any such error.
26 (5) A borrower may be required to pay all reasonable expenses
27 incurred in connection with the making, closing, disbursing, extending,
28 readjusting, or renewing of loans. Such expenses may include abstracting,
29 recording, releasing, and registration fees; premiums paid for nonfiling
30 insurance; premiums paid on insurance policies covering tangible personal
31 property securing the loan; amounts charged for a debt cancellation
-54-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 contract or a debt suspension contract, as agreed upon by the parties, if
2 the debt cancellation contract or debt suspension contract is a contract
3 of a financial institution or installment loan licensee and such contract
4 is sold directly by such financial institution or licensee or by an
5 unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent of such financial institution or
6 licensee in accordance with 12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part existed on
7 January 1, 2025, and the financial institution or installment loan
8 licensee is responsible for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent's
9 compliance with such part; title examinations; credit reports; survey;
10 taxes or charges imposed upon or in connection with the making and
11 recording or releasing of any mortgage; amounts charged for a guaranteed
12 asset protection waiver; and fees and expenses charged for electronic
13 title and lien services. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this
14 section, a borrower may also be required to pay a nonrefundable loan
15 origination fee not to exceed the lesser of five hundred dollars or an
16 amount equal to seven percent of that part of the original principal
17 balance of any loan not in excess of two thousand dollars and five
18 percent on that part of the original principal balance in excess of two
19 thousand dollars, if the installment loan licensee has not made another
20 loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months. If the licensee
21 has made another loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months,
22 a nonrefundable loan origination fee may only be charged on new funds
23 advanced on each successive loan. Such reasonable initial charges may be
24 collected from the borrower or included in the principal balance of the
25 loan at the time the loan is made and shall not be considered interest or
26 a charge for the use of the money loaned.
27 (6)(a) Loans secured solely by real property that are not made
28 pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property shall
29 not be subject to the limitations on the rate of interest provided in
30 subsection (1) of this section or the limitations on the nonrefundable
31 loan origination fee under subsection (5) of this section if (i) the
-55-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 principal amount of the loan is seven thousand five hundred dollars or
2 more and (ii) the sum of the principal amount of the loan and the
3 balances of all other liens against the property do not exceed one
4 hundred percent of the appraised value of the property. Acceptable
5 methods of determining appraised value shall be made by the department
6 pursuant to rule, regulation, or order.
7 (b) An origination fee on such loan shall be computed only on the
8 principal amount of the loan reduced by any portion of the principal that
9 consists of the amount required to pay off another loan made under this
10 subsection by the same licensee.
11 (c) A prepayment penalty on such loan shall be permitted only if (i)
12 the maximum amount of the penalty to be assessed is stated in writing at
13 the time the loan is made, (ii) the loan is prepaid in full within two
14 years from the date of the loan, and (iii) the loan is prepaid with money
15 other than the proceeds of another loan made by the same licensee. Such
16 prepayment penalty shall not exceed six months' interest on eighty
17 percent of the original principal balance computed at the agreed rate of
18 interest on the loan.
19 (d) An installment loan licensee making a loan pursuant to this
20 subsection may obtain an interest in any fixtures attached to such real
21 property and any insurance proceeds payable in connection with such real
22 property or the loan.
23 (e) For purposes of this subsection, principal amount of the loan
24 means the total sum owed by the borrower including, but not limited to,
25 insurance premiums, loan origination fees, or any other amount that is
26 financed, except that for purposes of subdivision (6)(b) of this section,
27 loan origination fees shall not be included in calculating the principal
28 amount of the loan.
29 Sec. 24. Section 45-350, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 45-350 (1) Installment loan licensees may charge, contract for, or
-56-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 receive any amount or rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.03 or
2 45-101.04 or section 23 of this act upon any loan or upon any part or all
3 of any aggregate indebtedness of the same person. Except as provided in
4 subsection (2) of this section, the charging, contracting for, or
5 receiving of a rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.04 does not
6 exempt the licensee from compliance with the Nebraska Installment Loan
7 and Sales Act.
8 (2)(a) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
9 subdivision (4) of section 45-101.04 are not subject to the Nebraska
10 Installment Loan and Sales Act if such loans are not made on real
11 property.
12 (b) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
13 subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property are not subject to
14 the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. An installment loan licensee
15 making such loans shall comply with and be subject to the Residential
16 Mortgage Licensing Act with respect to such loans, except that the
17 installment loan licensee shall not be required to obtain a mortgage
18 banker license under the Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
19 (c) Any mortgage loan originator who works as an employee or
20 independent agent of an installment loan licensee shall be required to
21 obtain a mortgage loan originator license and shall be subject to the
22 Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
23 (3) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(a) of section 23 of this
24 act, no installment loan licensee shall enter into any loan contract
25 under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act under which the
26 borrower agrees to make any payment of principal more than thirty-six
27 calendar months from the date of making such contract when the principal
28 balance is not more than three thousand dollars. Every loan contract
29 precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 23 of this act shall
30 provide for repayment of principal and charges in installments which
31 shall be payable at approximately equal periodic intervals of time and so
-57-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 arranged that no installment is substantially greater in amount than any
2 preceding installment. When necessary in order to facilitate payment in
3 accordance with the borrower's principal source of income or when the
4 loan contract is not precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 23
5 of this act, the payment schedule may reduce or omit installment
6 payments. Any loan contract made in violation of this section, either
7 knowingly or without the exercise of due care to prevent the violation,
8 shall not on that account be void, but the licensee has no right to
9 collect or receive any interest or charges on such loan. If any interest
10 or other charges have been collected or contracted for, the installment
11 loan licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest and other charges
12 collected and shall not collect thereafter any interest or other charges
13 contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as liquidated
14 damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if found
15 liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto, including
16 reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall be found
17 liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of the
18 evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
19 fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
20 adopted to avoid any such error.
21 (1) Renewal of a license originally granted under the Nebraska
22 Installment Sales Act may be denied or a license may be suspended or
23 revoked by the director on the following grounds: (a) Material
24 misstatement in the application for license; (b) willful failure to
25 comply with any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act relating
26 to installment contracts; (c) defrauding any buyer to the buyer's damage;
27 or (d) fraudulent misrepresentation, circumvention, or concealment by the
28 licensee through whatever subterfuge or device of any of the material
29 particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to
30 the buyer under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
31 (2) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
-58-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the
2 suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or
3 trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a
4 licensed partnership or limited liability company has so acted or failed
5 to act as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such
6 party as an individual.
7 (3) No license shall be denied, suspended, or revoked except after
8 hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The director
9 shall give the licensee at least ten days' written notice, in the form of
10 an order to show cause, of the time and place of such hearing by either
11 registered or certified mail addressed to the principal place of business
12 in this state of such licensee. Such notice shall contain the grounds of
13 complaint against the licensee. Any order suspending or revoking such
14 license shall recite the grounds upon which the same is based. The order
15 shall be entered upon the records of the director and shall not be
16 effective until after thirty days' written notice thereof given after
17 such entry forwarded by either registered or certified mail to the
18 licensee at such principal place of business.
19 (4) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
20 of any license shall not impair or affect the obligation of any lawful
21 installment contract acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
22 (5) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
23 of any license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts
24 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
25 surrender or affect liability for any fines which may be levied against
26 the licensee or any of its officers, directors, shareholders, partners,
27 or members pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act for acts
28 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
29 surrender.
30 (6) Any person, licensee, or applicant considering himself or
31 herself aggrieved by an order of the director entered under the
-59-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 provisions of this section may appeal the order. The appeal shall be in
2 accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
3 Sec. 25. Section 45-351, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 45-351 (1) Except as otherwise provided by the Nebraska Installment
6 Loan and Sales Act or other law, an installment loan licensee shall not
7 contact any individual who is not living, residing, or present in the
8 household of the borrower regarding the borrower's obligation to pay a
9 debt, other than the borrower's spouse, the borrower's attorney, another
10 creditor, or a credit reporting agency.
11 (2) The borrower may waive the benefits of this section at any time
12 by giving consent if such consent is given at a time subsequent to the
13 date the debt arises.
14 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
15 business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in the business
16 of a sales finance company subject to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
17 The director shall have the power to appoint examiners who shall, under
18 his or her direction, investigate the installment contracts and business
19 and examine the books and records of licensees when the director shall so
20 determine. Such examinations shall not be conducted more often than
21 annually except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
22 (2) The director or his or her duly authorized representative shall
23 have the power to make such investigations as he or she shall deem
24 necessary, and to the extent necessary for this purpose, he or she may
25 examine such licensee or any other person and shall have the power to
26 compel the production of all relevant books, records, accounts, and
27 documents.
28 (3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the
29 books and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set
30 forth in sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of
31 an investigation of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs
-60-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 shall be paid within thirty days after receipt of billing.
2 (4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or
3 inquiry request for information from the department, the licensee shall
4 respond within twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to
5 respond as required by this subsection shall constitute a separate
6 violation.
7 (5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing
8 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has
9 willfully and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska
10 Installment Sales Act, any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated
11 under the act, or any order issued by the director under the act, the
12 director may order such person to pay (a) an administrative fine of not
13 more than one thousand dollars for each separate violation and (b) the
14 costs of investigation. The department shall remit fines collected under
15 this subsection to the State Treasurer for distribution in accordance
16 with Article VII, section 5, of the Constitution of Nebraska.
17 (6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
18 investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien
19 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
20 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil
21 action by the director. The lien shall attach to the real property of
22 such person when notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real
23 property in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
24 real property is located. The lien shall attach to any other property of
25 such person when notice of the lien is filed against the property in the
26 manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and
27 costs shall constitute a separate violation of the Nebraska Installment
28 Sales Act.
29 Sec. 26. Section 45-352, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 45-352 (1) Section 45-351 shall not prohibit the licensee from:
-61-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (a) Contacting any person in order to discover property belonging to
2 the borrower that may be seized to satisfy a debt that has been reduced
3 to judgment;
4 (b) Making amicable demand and filing suit on the debt; or
5 (c) Contacting persons related to the borrower if permission is
6 specifically given in writing at the time the debt arises or at any time
7 after such debt arises.
8 (2) An installment loan licensee may contact any person without the
9 borrower's consent:
10 (a) To ascertain information relating to a borrower's credit
11 worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general
12 reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or
13 expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of
14 serving as a factor in establishing the borrower's eligibility for credit
15 or insurance if such contacts are not designed to collect a delinquent
16 debt; or
17 (b) To locate the borrower when the licensee has reason to believe
18 the borrower has changed his or her employment or has moved from his or
19 her last-known address.
20 The director shall have the power to make such general rules and
21 regulations and specific rulings, demands, and findings as may be
22 necessary for the proper conduct of the business licensed under the
23 Nebraska Installment Sales Act, and the enforcement of the act, in
24 addition thereto and not inconsistent therewith.
25 Sec. 27. Section 45-353, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 45-353 (1) An agreement of the parties to a loan, with respect to
28 default on the part of the borrower, is enforceable only to the extent
29 that:
30 (a) The borrower fails to make a payment on the loan or other
31 charges required by the agreement; or
-62-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (b) The prospect of payment, performance, or realization of
2 collateral is significantly impaired. The burden of establishing the
3 prospect of significant impairment is on the installment loan licensee.
4 (2) If the borrower has defaulted on his or her promise to pay and
5 if he or she has given specific notice in writing, by registered or
6 certified mail, instructing the licensee to cease further contacts with
7 the borrower in regard to the indebtedness, the installment loan licensee
8 shall, after such notice, except as provided in section 45-352, limit
9 contacts to one notice per month by mail. No notice shall be designed to
10 threaten action not otherwise permitted by law.
11 (3) With respect to a loan, after a borrower has been in default for
12 ten days for failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
13 licensee may give the borrower the notice described in this section. An
14 installment loan licensee gives notice to the borrower under this section
15 when it delivers the notice to the borrower or delivers or mails the
16 notice to the last-known address of the borrower's residence.
17 (4) The notice shall be in writing and shall conspicuously state:
18 (a) The name, address, and telephone number of the installment loan
19 licensee to which payment is to be made;
20 (b) A brief identification of the loan;
21 (c) The borrower's right to cure the default;
22 (d) The amount of payment and date by which payment must be made to
23 cure the default; and
24 (e) That any credit insurance issued in connection with the loan
25 contract may be canceled unless the borrower cures the default.
26 (5) With respect to a loan, after a default consisting only of the
27 borrower's failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
28 licensee may neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the
29 obligation nor take possession of collateral, except voluntarily
30 surrendered collateral, because of such default until twenty days after a
31 notice of the borrower's right to cure is given. The borrower shall have
-63-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 twenty days after the notice is given to cure any default consisting of a
2 failure to make the required payment by tendering the amount of all
3 unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without acceleration, plus any
4 unpaid charges. Cure restores the borrower to his or her rights under the
5 agreement as though the default had not occurred.
6 (6) With respect to defaults on the same obligation after an
7 installment loan licensee has once given a notice of the borrower's right
8 to cure, the borrower shall have no further right to cure and the
9 installment loan licensee has no obligation to proceed against the
10 borrower or the collateral.
11 (7) Upon default by a borrower with respect to a loan, unless the
12 borrower voluntarily surrenders possession of the collateral to the
13 licensee, the licensee may take possession of the collateral without
14 judicial process only if possession can be taken without entry into a
15 dwelling or a locked, unoccupied motor vehicle, and without the use of
16 force or other breach of the peace.
17 (1) Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any
18 person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate any of the
19 provisions of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act, he or she may, in
20 addition to all actions provided for in the act and without prejudice
21 thereto, enter an order requiring such person to desist or to refrain
22 from such violation. An action may also be brought, on the relation of
23 the Attorney General or the director, to enjoin such person from engaging
24 in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in
25 furtherance thereof.
26 (2) In any such action an order or judgment may be entered awarding
27 such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition
28 to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining
29 order or injunction, the court, in which such action is brought, shall
30 have power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the
31 property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
-64-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court
2 may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska
3 Installment Sales Act through or by means of the use of such property and
4 business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, shall have such
5 powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up
6 and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from time to
7 time, be conferred upon him or her by the court.
8 Sec. 28. Section 45-354, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
9 2024, is amended to read:
10 45-354 (1) A borrower is not liable for a deficiency unless the
11 licensee has disposed of the collateral in good faith and in a
12 commercially reasonable manner.
13 (2) If the installment loan licensee takes possession or voluntarily
14 accepts surrender of goods in which the licensee has a security interest
15 to secure a loan and at the time thereof the unpaid balance due on the
16 loan is three thousand dollars or less, the borrower is not personally
17 liable to the installment loan licensee for the unpaid balance of the
18 debt arising from the loan and the licensee's duty to dispose of the
19 collateral is governed by the provisions on disposition of collateral,
20 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code.
21 (3) The borrower may be liable in damages to the installment loan
22 licensee if the borrower has wrongfully damaged the collateral or if,
23 after default, failure to cure, and demand, the borrower has wrongfully
24 failed to make the collateral available to the installment loan licensee.
25 (4) If the installment loan licensee elects to bring an action
26 against the borrower for a debt arising from a loan, when under this
27 section the installment loan licensee would not be entitled to a
28 deficiency judgment if the installment loan licensee took possession of
29 the collateral, and obtains judgment, (a) the installment loan licensee
30 may not take possession of the collateral and (b) the collateral is not
31 subject to levy or sale on execution or similar proceedings pursuant to
-65-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 the judgment.
2 (1) Effective January 1, 2013, or within one hundred eighty days

4 accepting licenses issued under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act,
5 whichever is later, the department shall require such licensees under the
6 act to be licensed and registered through the Nationwide Mortgage
7 Licensing System and Registry. In order to carry out this requirement,
8 the department is authorized to participate in the Nationwide Mortgage
9 Licensing System and Registry. For this purpose, the department may
10 establish, by adopting and promulgating rules and regulations or by

2 (2) In order to fulfill the purposes of the Nebraska Installment
3 Sales Act, the department is authorized to establish relationships or
4 contracts with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry or
5 other entities designated by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and
6 Registry to collect and maintain records and process transaction fees or
7 other fees related to licensees or other persons subject to the act. The

9 the department and allow such system to collect a processing fee for the
10 services of the system directly from each licensee or applicant for a
11 license.

21 of security of the system notification policy. The director shall make
22 available upon written request a copy of the contract between the
23 department and the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry
24 pertaining to the breach of security of the system provisions.
25 (6) The department shall upon written request provide the most
26 recently available audited financial report of the Nationwide Mortgage
27 Licensing System and Registry.
28 (7) The director may use the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System

27 disclosed to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. Such
28 information and material may be shared with all federal and state
29 regulatory officials with mortgage industry oversight authority without

-68-
LB474 LB474

12 discretion of such person, that privilege;
13 (c) Any state statute relating to the disclosure of confidential
14 supervisory information or any information or material described in
15 subdivision (a) of this subsection that is inconsistent with such

17 the amount of such insurance shall not exceed the total amount to be
18 repaid under the loan contract and the term shall not extend beyond the
19 final maturity date of the loan contract. In the event of a renewal of a
20 loan contract, this type of insurance shall be canceled and a refund of
21 the unearned premium credited or made before new insurance of this type
22 may be written in connection with such loan. Such insurance shall not be
23 required as a condition precedent to the making of such loan.
24 (2) In addition to the types of insurance written under subsection
25 (1) of this section by licensees under the act, any other type of
26 insurance or motor club service as defined in section 44-3707 may be
27 provided for the benefit of a licensee's borrower or the borrower's
28 immediate family whether or not in connection with a loan, except that
29 such insurance or motor club service shall not be required as a condition
30 precedent to the making of any loan. Nothing in this subsection alters or
31 eliminates any insurance licensing requirements or certificate of
-72-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 authority requirements under the Motor Club Services Act.
2 (3) Notwithstanding section 23 of this act and section 45-350, any
3 gain or advantage, in the form of commission or otherwise, to the
4 licensee or to any employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee from
5 such insurance or motor club service or the sale thereof shall not be
6 deemed to be an additional or further charge in connection with the loan
7 contract. The insurance premium or motor club service contract fee may be
8 collected from the borrower or financed through the loan contract at the
9 time the loan is made.
10 (4)(a) Insurance permitted under this section shall be obtained
11 through a duly licensed insurance agent, agency, or broker. Premiums
12 shall not exceed those fixed by law or current applicable manual rates.
13 Insurance written, as authorized by this section, may contain a mortgage
14 clause or other appropriate provision to protect the insurable interest
15 of the licensee.
16 (b) Motor club services permitted under this section shall be
17 obtained through a motor club which holds a certificate of authority
18 under the Motor Club Services Act.
19 (5) In the event of a renewal of a loan contract, any insurance or
20 motor club service sold pursuant to this section shall be canceled and
21 (a) a refund of the unearned premium or motor club service contract fee
22 credited or made before new insurance or motor club service of the same
23 type as that being canceled may be rewritten or (b) the holder of the
24 loan contract shall send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days
25 after cancellation of the name, address, and telephone number of the
26 insurance company or motor club which issued the insurance contract or
27 motor club service contract or the party responsible for any refund and
28 notice that the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice
29 shall be retained by the holder of the loan contract.
30 (6) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this
31 section is canceled or the premium or motor club service contract fee
-73-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 adjusted during the term of the loan contract, any refund of the
2 insurance premium or motor club service contract fee plus the unearned
3 interest thereon received by the holder shall be credited by the holder
4 to the loan contract or otherwise refunded, except to the extent applied
5 toward payment for similar insurance or motor club service protecting the
6 interests of the buyer and the holder or either of them.
7 (7) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this
8 section is canceled due to the payment of all sums for which the buyer is
9 liable under a loan contract, the holder of the loan contract shall, upon
10 receipt of payment of all sums due, send notice to the buyer within
11 fifteen business days after payment of the sums due of the name, address,
12 and telephone number of the insurance company or motor club which issued
13 the insurance contract or motor club service contract or the party
14 responsible for any refund and notice that the buyer may be eligible for
15 a refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of the
16 loan contract. This subsection does not apply if the holder of the loan
17 contract previously credited the refund of the insurance premium or motor
18 club service contract fee to the loan contract or otherwise refunded the
19 insurance premium or motor club service contract fee to the buyer.
20 (8) The licensee shall, at the time the loan is made, give to the
21 borrower, or if more than one, to one of them, a statement concerning any
22 insurance procured by or through the licensee, which includes the amount
23 of any premium which the borrower has paid or is obligated to pay, the
24 expiration date of the policy, and a concise description of the risks
25 insured. If a borrower procures insurance by or through a licensee, the
26 licensee shall deliver to the borrower within fifteen days after the
27 making of the loan an executed copy of the insurance policy or
28 certificate of insurance.
29 Sec. 34. (1) Licensees holding an active installment loan license
30 may make preauthorized loans. Preauthorized loan means a loan made by a
31 licensee pursuant to an agreement between the licensee and the borrower
-74-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 whereby:
2 (a) The licensee may permit the borrower to obtain advances of money
3 from the licensee from time to time or the licensee may advance money on
4 behalf of the borrower from time to time as directed by the borrower;
5 (b) The amount of each advance and permitted charge and cost is
6 debited to the borrower's account and payments and other credits are
7 credited to the same account;
8 (c) The charges are computed on the unpaid principal balance or
9 balances of the account from time to time;
10 (d) The borrower has the privilege of paying the account in full at
11 any time or, if the account is not in default, in monthly installments or
12 fixed or determinable amounts as provided in the agreement; and
13 (e) The loan agreement expressly states that it covers preauthorized
14 loans. Preauthorized loan does not mean a transaction, resulting in
15 either a credit or a debit to the borrower's account, which is initiated
16 by the use or application of a plastic, metal, or other type of credit or
17 transaction card.
18 (2) For purposes of computations relating to preauthorized loans
19 made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, billing
20 cycle means the time interval between periodic billing dates. A billing
21 cycle shall be considered monthly if the closing date of the cycle is the
22 same date each month or does not vary by more than four days from such
23 date.
24 Sec. 35. (1) A licensee may make preauthorized loans and may
25 contract for and receive charges on such loans as set forth in subsection
26 (1) of section 23 of this act, subject to the following requirements:
27 (a) A licensee shall not compound charges by adding any unpaid
28 charges authorized by section 23 of this act or this section to the
29 unpaid principal balance of the borrower's account, except that the
30 unpaid principal balance may include additional charges for credit life
31 insurance or credit disability insurance provided in connection with the
-75-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 preauthorized loan, subject to the requirements and restrictions
2 contained in section 36 of this act;
3 (b) Charges authorized by section 23 of this act or this section
4 shall be deemed not to exceed the maximum charges permitted by such
5 sections if such charges are computed in each billing cycle by any of the
6 following methods:
7 (i) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
8 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the daily unpaid
9 principal balance of the account, in which case each daily rate is
10 determined by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by twelve and
11 dividing by three hundred sixty-five;
12 (ii) By multiplying each graduated monthly rate by the applicable
13 portion of the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in
14 the billing cycle, in which case the average daily unpaid principal
15 balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided
16 by the number of days in the cycle; or
17 (iii) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
18 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the average
19 daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in
20 which case each daily rate is determined by multiplying the authorized
21 monthly rate by twelve and dividing by three hundred sixty-five, and the
22 average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid
23 each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in the cycle; and
24 (c) For each method of computation set forth in this section, the
25 billing cycle shall be monthly and the unpaid principal balance on any
26 day shall be determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the
27 beginning of that day all advances and other permissible amounts charged
28 to the borrower and deducting all payments and other credits made or
29 received that day.
30 (2) The borrower under a preauthorized loan may at any time pay all
31 or any part of the unpaid balance in his or her account, or, if the
-76-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 account is not in default, the borrower may pay the unpaid principal
2 balance in monthly installments. Minimum monthly payment requirements
3 shall be determined by the licensee and set forth in the preauthorized
4 loan agreement, except that the minimum monthly payment shall not be less
5 than one and one-half percent of the average daily unpaid principal
6 balance of an account having an average daily balance of more than three
7 thousand dollars nor less than two percent of the average daily unpaid
8 principal balance of an account having an average daily balance of three
9 thousand dollars or less.
10 (3) A licensee may retain any security interest, including a
11 mortgage on real property, until the preauthorized account is terminated.
12 (4) Subsection (4) of section 45-345, subsection (3) of section
13 45-350, and section 31 of this act shall not apply to preauthorized
14 loans.
15 (5) The department may approve record-keeping systems for licensees
16 and may prescribe policies and procedures necessary to the administration
17 of preauthorized loans made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and
18 Sales Act.
19 Sec. 36. In addition to the charges permitted under section 35 of
20 this act, a licensee may contract for and receive the fees, costs, and
21 expenses permitted by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act on
22 other loans, subject to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in
23 the act with the following variations:
24 (1) If credit life or disability insurance is provided and if the
25 insured dies or becomes disabled when there is an outstanding
26 preauthorized loan indebtedness, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay
27 the total balance of the loan due on the date of the borrower's death or
28 the amount due as of the end of the previous billing cycle, whichever is
29 less, in the case of credit life insurance, or all minimum payments which
30 become due on the loan during the covered period of disability in the
31 case of credit disability insurance. The additional charge for credit
-77-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 life insurance or credit disability insurance shall be calculated in each
2 billing cycle by applying the current monthly premium rate for such
3 insurance, as such rate may be determined by the Director of Insurance,
4 to the unpaid balances in the borrower's account, using either of the
5 methods specified in section 35 of this act for the calculation of loan
6 charges;
7 (2) No credit life or disability insurance written in connection
8 with a preauthorized loan shall be canceled by the licensee because of
9 delinquency of the borrower in the making of the required minimum
10 payments on the loan unless one or more of such payments is past due for
11 a period of ninety days or more, and the licensee shall advance to the
12 insurer the amounts required to keep the insurance in force during such
13 period, which amounts may be debited to the borrower's account;
14 (3) The department may, by rule and regulation or order, require a
15 statement of insurance that will be appropriate for preauthorized loans
16 in lieu of that required by section 33 of this act; and
17 (4) The amount, terms, and conditions of any insurance against loss
18 or damage to property must be reasonable in relation to the character and
19 value of the property insured and the maximum anticipated amount of
20 credit to be extended.
21 Sec. 37. (1) For purposes of this section, reverse-mortgage loan
22 means a loan made by a licensee which (a) is secured by residential real
23 estate, (b) is nonrecourse to the borrower except in the event of fraud
24 by the borrower or waste to the residential real estate given as security
25 for the loan, (c) provides cash advances to the borrower based upon the
26 equity in the borrower's owner-occupied principal residence, (d) requires
27 no payment of principal or interest until the entire loan becomes due and
28 payable, and (e) otherwise complies with the terms of this section.
29 (2) Reverse-mortgage loans shall be governed by the following rules
30 without regard to the requirements set out elsewhere for other types of
31 mortgage transactions: (a) Payment in whole or in part is permitted
-78-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 without penalty at any time during the period of the loan; (b) an advance
2 and interest on the advance have priority over a lien filed after the
3 closing of a reverse-mortgage loan; (c) an interest rate may be fixed or
4 adjustable and may also provide for interest that is contingent on
5 appreciation in the value of the residential real estate; and (d) the
6 advance shall not be reduced in amount or number based on an adjustment
7 in the interest rate when a reverse-mortgage loan provides for periodic
8 advances to a borrower.
9 (3) Reverse-mortgage loans may be made or acquired without regard to
10 the following provisions for other types of mortgage transactions: (a)
11 Limitations on the purpose and use of future advances or any other
12 mortgage proceeds; (b) limitations on future advances to a term of years
13 or limitations on the term of credit line advances; (c) limitations on
14 the term during which future advances take priority over intervening
15 advances; (d) requirements that a maximum mortgage amount be stated in
16 the mortgage; (e) limitations on loan-to-value ratios; (f) prohibitions
17 on balloon payments; (g) prohibitions on compounded interest and interest
18 on interest; and (h) requirements that a percentage of the loan proceeds
19 must be advanced prior to loan assignment.
20 (4) A licensee may, in connection with a reverse-mortgage loan,
21 charge to the borrower (a) a nonrefundable loan origination fee which
22 does not exceed two percent of the appraised value of the owner-occupied
23 principal residence at the time the loan is made, (b) a reasonable fee
24 paid to third parties originating loans on behalf of the licensee, and
25 (c) such other fees as are necessary and required, including fees for
26 inspections, insurance, appraisals, and surveys.
27 (5) Licensees failing to make loan advances as required in the loan
28 documents and failing to cure the default as required in the loan
29 documents shall forfeit an amount equal to the greater of two hundred
30 dollars or one percent of the amount of the loan advance the licensee
31 failed to make.

2 writing, shall be signed by both the buyer and the seller, and shall
3 contain the following items, and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the

19 licensee in accordance with 12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part existed on
20 January 1, 2025, and the financial institution or licensee is responsible
21 for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent's compliance with such part, and

29 (e), and (f) of this subsection;
30 (h) The time-price differential;

11 stated in the sequence or order set forth in such subsection. Additional
12 items may be included to explain the computations made in determining the
13 amount to be paid by the buyer. No installment sales contract shall be
14 signed by the buyer or proffered by the seller when it contains blank
15 spaces to be filled in after execution, except that if delivery of the
16 goods or services is not made at the time of the execution of the
17 contract, the identifying numbers or marks of the goods, or similar
18 information, and the due date of the first installment may be inserted in
19 the contract after its execution.
20 (4) If a seller proffers an installment sales contract as part of a
21 transaction which delays or cancels, or promises to delay or cancel, the
22 payment of the time-price differential on the contract if the buyer pays
23 the basic time price, cash price, or cash sale price within a certain
24 period of time, the seller shall, in clear and conspicuous writing,
25 either within the installment sales contract or in a separate document,
26 inform the buyer of the exact date by which the buyer must pay the basic
27 time price, cash price, or cash sale price in order to delay or cancel
28 the payment of the time-price differential. The seller or any subsequent
29 purchaser of the installment sales contract, including a sales finance
30 company, shall not be allowed to change such date.
31 (5) Upon written request from the buyer, the holder of an
-81-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 installment sales contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written
2 statement of the dates and amounts of payments and the total amount
3 unpaid under such contract. A buyer shall be given a written receipt for
4 any payment when made in cash.
5 (6) After payment of all sums for which the buyer is obligated under
6 a contract, the holder shall deliver or mail to the buyer at his or her
7 last-known address one or more good and sufficient instruments or copies
8 thereof to acknowledge payment in full and shall release all security in
9 the goods and mark canceled and return to the buyer the original
10 agreement or copy thereof or instruments or copies thereof signed by the
11 buyer. For purposes of this section, a copy shall meet the requirements
12 of section 25-12,112.
13 Sec. 39. (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law,
14 the time-price differential for any goods or services sold under an
15 installment sales contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual
16 percentage rate and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to
17 exceed eighteen percent per annum, except that a minimum time-price
18 differential of ten dollars may be charged on any installment sales
19 contract.
20 (b) Origination fees may be required to be made by the buyer,
21 subject to the following requirements:
22 (i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the installment
23 sales contract, to pay an origination fee in an amount not to exceed ten
24 dollars, except that if the installment sales contract is for an
25 installment sale of agricultural machinery or equipment for use in
26 commercial agriculture or if the installment sales contract is for an
27 installment sale of industrial machinery or equipment the buyer may be
28 required to pay (A) an origination fee of not to exceed one hundred
29 dollars if the cash sale price is less than twenty-five thousand dollars
30 or (B) an origination fee of not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars, if
31 the cash sale price is twenty-five thousand dollars or more; and
-82-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (ii) The origination fee shall be refundable if the installment
2 sales contract is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination
3 fee may be collected from the buyer or included in the principal balance
4 of the installment sales contract at the time the contract is made and
5 shall not be considered interest or a time-price differential.
6 (c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act prohibits
7 a seller or holder of an installment sales contract from contracting for,
8 computing, and charging a time-price differential based upon the
9 application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the
10 number of days actually elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used
11 for the purpose of calculating the time-price differential, the time-
12 price balance, the amount of each installment, and the time-sale price.
13 (d) When the installment sales contract is payable in substantially
14 equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential
15 shall be computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined
16 under section 38 of this act, from the date of the contract until the due
17 date of the final installment, notwithstanding that the time-price
18 balance is required to be paid in installments.
19 (2) When an installment sales contract provides for payment other
20 than in substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the
21 time-price differential may be at a rate which will provide the same
22 return as is permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts
23 under subdivision (1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the
24 schedule of payments.
25 (3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide
26 for payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each
27 installment or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall
28 be determined.
29 Sec. 40. (1) The amount, if any, included for insurance, which may
30 be purchased by the holder of the contract, shall not exceed the
31 applicable premium rates chargeable in accordance with filings, if any,
-83-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 with the Department of Insurance. If dual interest insurance on the goods
2 is purchased by the holder, it shall, within thirty days after execution
3 of the installment sales contract, send or cause to be sent to the buyer
4 a policy or policies or certificate of insurance, written by an insurance
5 company authorized to do business in this state, clearly setting forth
6 the amount of the premium, the kind or kinds of insurance, the coverages,
7 and all the terms and conditions of the contract or contracts of
8 insurance.
9 (2) If any insurance is canceled or the premium adjusted during the
10 term of the installment sales contract, any refund of the insurance
11 premium plus the unearned time-price differential thereon received by the
12 holder shall be credited by the holder to the last maturing installment
13 of the contract except to the extent applied toward payment for similar
14 insurance protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder or either
15 of them.
16 (3) If any insurance is canceled due to the payment of all sums for
17 which the buyer is liable under an installment sales contract, the holder
18 of the installment sales contract shall, upon receipt of payment of all
19 sums due, send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days of the
20 name, address, and telephone number of the insurance company which issued
21 the insurance contract or the party responsible for any refund, and
22 notice that the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice
23 shall be retained by the holder of the installment sales contract. This
24 subsection does not apply if the holder of the loan contract previously
25 credited the refund of the insurance premium to the loan contract or
26 otherwise refunded the insurance premium to the buyer.
27 (4) The holder may also purchase nonfiling insurance and charge a
28 reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges
29 prescribed by law which would have been paid to public officials for
30 filing, perfecting, releasing, and satisfying any lien or security
31 interest in the goods or services.
-84-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 Sec. 41. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the
2 contrary, any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the
3 obligation of any contract.
4 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
5 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
6 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
7 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
8 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
9 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
10 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
11 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
12 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
13 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
14 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
15 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
16 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
17 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
18 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
19 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
20 date judgment is obtained.
21 Sec. 42. (1) Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods
22 or services from a seller from whom such buyer has previously purchased
23 goods or services under one or more installment sales contracts and the
24 amounts under such contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price
25 thereof have not been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may be
26 included in and consolidated with one or more of the prior contract or
27 contracts. A memorandum of such additional purchases shall be prepared by
28 the seller and inserted in or attached to the seller's counterpart of the
29 contract and shall set forth:
30 (a) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the
31 additional goods or services sold and all the information with respect to
-85-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 the additional purchase required by section 38 of this act to be included
2 in an installment sales contract;
3 (b) The consolidated time-price balance to be paid by the buyer; and
4 (c) The revised payments.
5 (2) A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as
6 provided in and subject to section 38 of this act. When such subsequent
7 purchases are made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such
8 subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied on previous
9 purchases.
10 (3) Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment sales
11 contract shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases
12 in the same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the
13 various purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred
14 payment is increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the
15 subsequent payments, at the seller's option, may be deemed to be
16 allocated as follows: An amount equal to the original installment payment
17 to the previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The
18 amount of any initial payment or downpayment on the subsequent purchase
19 shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase. This
20 section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or other
21 merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or to
22 repairs or services in connection therewith rendered by the seller at the
23 buyer's request.
24 Sec. 43. (1) An installment sales contract may provide and the

2025 2025
1 the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually elapsed,
2 such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent of each installment
3 or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any installment payment is

22 extension or deferment in addition to the time-price differential
23 calculated for the period of such extension or deferment at the rate
24 originally agreed upon in the retail installment sales contract on the
25 outstanding balance.
26 Sec. 45. (1) If any seller or sales finance company, in the making
27 or collection of an installment sales contract, shall, directly or

12 due date, or any extension thereof, of the last installment of the
13 contract.
14 Sec. 46. (1) A licensee shall not refuse to enter into a loan or
15 impose finance charges or other terms or conditions of credit more
16 onerous than those regularly extended by that licensee to borrowers of
17 similar economic backgrounds because of the age, color, creed, national
18 origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sex, marital status, or
19 disability of the borrower or because the borrower receives public
20 assistance, social security benefits, pension benefits, or the like.
21 (2) No licensee shall conduct the business of making loans under the
22 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act within any office, room, or place
23 of business in which any other business is solicited or engaged in, or in
24 association or conjunction with any other business, if the director finds
25 that the other business is of such nature that the conducting of such
26 other business tends to conceal evasion of the act or of the rules and
27 regulations adopted and promulgated under the act. In such case, the
28 director shall order such licensee in writing to cease and desist from
29 such conduct.
30 (3) No licensee shall, directly or indirectly, require a borrower as

13 things in action. The director may order any licensee to cease and desist
14 from any conduct which he or she finds to be a violation of this section.
15 The director may require that rates of charge, if stated by a licensee,
16 be stated fully and clearly in such manner as the director deems
17 necessary to prevent misunderstanding by prospective borrowers.

22 Every person participating in such loan in this state is subject to the
23 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, except that the act shall not
24 apply to loans legally made in any state under and in accordance with a
25 regulatory small loan law similar in principle to such act.

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 which the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have to maintain for
2 purposes of subsection (1) of this section.
3 (8) In order to promote more effective regulation and reduce the
4 regulatory burden through supervisory information sharing:
5 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements

7 of any information or material provided to the Nationwide Mortgage
8 Licensing System and Registry, and any privilege arising under federal or
9 state law, including the rules of any federal or state court, with
10 respect to such information or material, shall continue to apply to such

13 Sec. 48. The director may adopt and promulgate rules and

16 Sec. 49. Any person violating subsection (4) of section 45-345,
17 section 23 of this act, section 45-356, or section 33 of this act is
18 guilty of a Class II misdemeanor. If, in the making of, or collection on,
19 any loan contract, any act is done which constitutes a Class II
20 misdemeanor under this section, that loan shall not be void, but the
21 licensee shall have no right to collect or receive any interest or

23 the licensee shall forfeit and refund to the borrower all interest and
24 other charges collected on the loan involved and shall not collect

26 due on the loan involved, as liquidated damages, and the licensee or its

29 liable under this section if the licensee shows by a preponderance of the
30 evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
31 fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
-94-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 adopted to avoid any such error.
2 Sec. 50. Any violation of section 46 of this act, in connection
3 with any loan transaction, however acquired, shall not render the

5 action, other than a class action, the borrower may recover from the
6 licensee violating section 46 of this act an award of liquidated damages
7 in an amount determined by the court, but not less than five hundred
8 dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. In any legal action brought
9 pursuant to this section in which the licensee is found liable, the court
10 shall award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the borrower. A
11 licensee is not liable under this section if the licensee notifies the
12 borrower of an error before the licensee receives from the borrower
13 written notice of the error or before the borrower has brought an action
14 under this section and the licensee corrects the error within thirty days
15 after notifying the borrower. A licensee may not be held liable in any
16 action brought under this section if the licensee shows by a
17 preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and
18 resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of
19 procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error.
20 Sec. 51. Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that
21 any person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate the
22 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, the director may, in addition to
23 any action provided in the act and without prejudice thereto, enter an
24 order requiring such person to cease and desist or to refrain from such
25 violation. An action may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney
26 General and the director, to enjoin such person from engaging in or
27 continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of
28 such violation. In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered
29 awarding such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In
30 addition to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a
31 restraining order or injunction, the court, in which such action is
-95-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 brought, has power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for
2 the property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
3 documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court
4 may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska
5 Installment Loan and Sales Act through or by means of the use of such
6 property and business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified,
7 has such powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration,
8 winding up, and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from
9 time to time, be conferred upon the receiver by the court.
10 Sec. 52. (1) The department may order any person to cease and
11 desist whenever the department determines that the person has violated
12 any provision of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. Upon entry
13 of a cease and desist order, the director shall promptly notify the
14 affected person that such order has been entered, of the reasons for such
15 order, and that upon receipt, within fifteen business days after the date
16 of the order, of written request from the affected person a hearing will
17 be scheduled within thirty business days after the date of receipt of the
18 written request unless the parties consent to a later date or the hearing
19 officer sets a later date for good cause. If a hearing is not requested
20 and none is ordered by the director, the order shall remain in effect
21 until it is modified or vacated.
22 (2) The director may vacate or modify a cease and desist order if he
23 or she finds that the conditions which caused its entry have changed or
24 that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.
25 (3) A person aggrieved by a cease and desist order of the director
26 may obtain judicial review of the order in the manner prescribed in the
27 Administrative Procedure Act and the rules and regulations adopted and
28 promulgated by the department under the act. The director may obtain an
29 order from the district court of Lancaster County for the enforcement of
30 the cease and desist order.
31 (4) A person who violates a cease and desist order of the director
-96-
LB474 LB474

4 fines collected under this section to the State Treasurer for
5 distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the
6 Constitution of Nebraska.
7 Sec. 53. (1) The director may, following a hearing under the
8 Administrative Procedure Act, impose an administrative fine against any
9 officer, director, shareholder, partner, or member of a licensee, if the
10 director finds the licensee or any such person participated in or had
11 knowledge of any act prohibited by the Nebraska Installment Loan and
12 Sales Act or otherwise violated the act. Such administrative fine shall
13 be in addition to or separate from any fine imposed against a licensee
14 pursuant to section 45-346.
15 (2) If the director finds, after notice and hearing in accordance
16 with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has knowingly
17 committed any act prohibited by section 46 of this act or otherwise
18 violated the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act or any rule and
19 regulation or order adopted thereunder, the director may order such
20 person to pay (a) an administrative fine of not more than five thousand
21 dollars for each separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation.
22 (3) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
23 investigation ordered pursuant to this section, a lien in the amount of
24 such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of such
25 person in this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the
26 director. The lien shall attach to the real property of such person when
27 notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real property in the
28 office of the register of deeds in the county where the real property is
29 located. The lien shall attach to any other property of such person when
30 notice of the lien is filed against the property in the manner prescribed
31 by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and costs shall constitute
-97-
LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 a separate violation of the act.
2 (4) The department shall remit fines collected under this section to
3 the State Treasurer for distribution in accordance with Article VII,
4 section 5, of the Constitution of Nebraska.
5 Sec. 54. All original license fees, annual renewal fees,

2 amended to read:
3 8-319 (1) No loan shall be made by such association except to its
4 own members, and no loan shall be made to any member for any sum in
5 excess of the par value of his or her stock. The borrower shall pledge to
6 the association, as security for the loan, shares of a maturity value
7 equal to the principal of the loan and, except as otherwise provided in
8 this section, ample security by mortgage or deeds of trust on real
9 estate. For purposes of this section, real property and real estate shall
10 include a leasehold or subleasehold estate in real property under a lease
11 or sublease the term of which does not expire, or which is renewable
12 automatically or at the option of the holder or of the association so as
13 not to expire for at least five years beyond the maturity of the debt.
14 Loans made upon improved real estate, except as otherwise provided in
15 this section, shall not exceed ninety-five percent of the reasonable
16 normal cash value thereof, and all loans made on any other real estate
17 shall not exceed three-fourths of the reasonable normal cash value
18 thereof.
19 (2) An association may make a loan or loans in an amount exceeding
20 ninety-five percent of the reasonable normal cash value of the real
21 estate security (a) if such loan or loans are made to a veteran in accord
22 with the provisions of 38 U.S.C., as now existing or as hereafter
23 amended, (b) if the proceeds of the loan or loans are to be used in
24 purchasing residential property or in constructing a dwelling on
25 unimproved property owned by such veteran to be occupied as his or her
26 home, used for the purpose of making repairs, alterations, or
27 improvements in or paying delinquent indebtedness, taxes, or special
28 assessments on residential property owned by the veteran and used by him
29 or her as his or her home, or used in purchasing any land and buildings
30 to be used by the applicant in pursuing a gainful occupation other than

1 portion of such loan or loans in excess of ninety-five percent of the
2 reasonable normal cash value of the real estate security.
3 (3) An association is authorized to obtain insurance of its loans by
4 the Federal Housing Administrator under Title II of the National Housing
5 Act, as amended, and such loans so made upon improved real estate and so
6 insured shall not be subject to the restrictions set forth in this
7 section with reference to the maximum authorized amount of a loan.
8 (4) An association may make unsecured loans to its members if such
9 loans (a) are insured under Title I and Title II of the National Housing
10 Act, as amended, or (b) are for property alterations, repair, or
11 improvements. The aggregate amount of loans made under subdivisions (a)
12 and (b) of this subsection shall not at any time exceed twenty percent of
13 the association's assets. Each loan made under subdivision (b) of this
14 subsection shall be repayable in regular monthly installments within a
15 period of twenty years and shall be supported by a written property
16 statement on forms to be prescribed by the Department of Banking and
17 Finance. An association may make secured loans to its members and may
18 make loans under 38 U.S.C., as amended, under Chapter V, subchapter C of
19 the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended (12 U.S.C.), and on the
20 security of mobile homes.
21 (5) The stock of such association may be accepted as security for a
22 loan of the amount of the withdrawal value of such stock without other
23 security.
24 (6) An association when so licensed may make loans to its own
25 members upon the terms and security set forth in the Nebraska Installment
26 Loan and Sales Act.
27 (7) Any provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding,
28 an association may make any loan that a federal savings and loan
29 association doing business in this state is or may be authorized to make.
30 (8) An association may invest in loans, obligations, and advances of

1 for the payment of expenses of business school, technical training
2 school, college, or university education, but no association shall make
3 any investment in loans under this subsection if the principal amount of
4 its investment in such loans, exclusive of any investment which is or
5 which at the time of its making was otherwise authorized, would thereupon
6 exceed five percent of its assets. Such loans may be secured, partly
7 secured, or unsecured, and the association may require a comaker or
8 comakers, insurance, guaranty under a governmental student loan guarantee
9 plan, or other protection against contingencies. The borrower shall
10 certify to the association that the proceeds of the loan are to be used
11 by a full-time student solely for the payment of expenses of business,
12 technical training school, college, or university education.
13 (9) An association may participate with other lenders in making
14 loans of any type that an association may otherwise make if (a) each of
15 the lenders is either an instrumentality of the United States Government
16 or is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or, in the
17 case of another lender, the interest of the association in such loan is
18 superior to the participating interests of the other participants and (b)
19 an association whose accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit
20 Insurance Corporation which may be a federal association or an
21 association chartered by this state, or another association chartered by
22 this state which is not so insured, has otherwise complied with
23 subsection (1) of this section with respect to loans to members.
24 (10) An association may sell to or purchase from any institution
25 which is a savings association chartered by this state or the accounts of
26 which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation a
27 participating interest in any loan, whether or not, in the case of a
28 purchase, the security is located within the association's regular
29 lending area.

31 amended to read:

4 Such expenses may include abstract, recording, and registration fees,

28 detail the charges and fees such borrower has paid or obligated himself
29 or herself to pay to the association or to any other person in connection
30 with such loan. A copy of such statement shall be retained in the records

1 Sec. 4. Section 8-820.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 8-820.01 It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the State
4 of Nebraska that for purposes of applying the federal most-favored-lender
5 doctrine, the bank credit card rate contained in section 8-820 is not
6 comparable or analogous to the small loan rate found in section 23 of
7 this act sections 45-1024 and section 45-350 45-1025. The Legislature
8 finds that the institutions making small loans and the institutions
9 administering a bank credit card are categorically different. The
10 transactions carried on by these institutions are categorically
11 different. The Legislature finds that small loan borrowers and bank
12 credit card users are not synonymous or comparable. In establishing a
13 small loan rate, the Legislature has recognized a risk factor that is
14 different and greater than other financial transactions and therefor
15 justifies the charging of a higher interest rate than installment loans,
16 personal loans, retail revolving credit plans, or bank credit card
17 interest rates.
18 Sec. 5. Section 44-1703, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

23 connection with a loan or other credit transaction of more than ten years
24 duration or fifteen years duration when made by licensees under the
25 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. No insurance shall be subject to
26 sections 44-1701 to 44-1713 when the issuance of such insurance is an
27 isolated transaction on the part of the insurer and not related to an
28 agreement or a plan for insuring debtors of the creditor.

19 agreement which had been entered into with the director;
20 (d) The licensee has knowingly provided or caused to be provided to

26 licensee by the director or failed to comply with a notice of
27 investigation or inquiry pursuant to section 45-346 or failed to make any

24 mortgage loan originator license in this state without first obtaining
25 such license.
26 (3) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
27 association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the
28 suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or
29 trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a
30 licensed partnership or limited liability company has so acted or failed
31 to act as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such

18 (6) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
19 of any license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts
20 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
21 surrender or affect liability for any fines which may be levied against
22 the licensee or any of the licensee's officers, directors, shareholders,
23 partners, or members pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
24 Act for acts committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation,
25 expiration, or surrender of the license.
26 (7) Whenever, for any cause, a license is revoked, the department
27 shall not issue another license to the licensee unless the department is
28 otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so.

10 on each installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen
11 days, if provided for in the contract, not in excess of five percent of
12 each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu
13 thereof, interest after maturity on each such installment not exceeding
14 the highest permissible contract rate. If the time-price differential is
15 computed by application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal
16 balance for the number of days actually elapsed, such delinquency charge
17 may not exceed five percent of each installment or twenty-five dollars,
18 whichever is less. If any installment payment is made by a check, draft,
19 or similar signed order which is not honored because of insufficient
20 funds, no account, or any other reason except an error of a third party
21 to the contract, the holder may charge and collect a fee of not more than
22 fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such fee may be collected
23 when due or at any time thereafter.
24 When an installment contract is for a commercial or business purpose
25 (1) a delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of each unpaid
26 installment may be contracted for and received and (2) the holder of any
27 check or draft or similar order which is not honored for any reason,
28 except for error of a third party, may charge and collect a fee as stated
29 in the contract. As used in this section, commercial or business purpose
30 means primarily for a purpose other than a personal, family, or household
31 purpose.

1 Sec. 16. Section 45-342, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 45-342 Any person who, by any device, subterfuge, or pretense
4 whatsoever, engages in or continues any of the kinds of business or
5 enterprise permitted to licensees by the Nebraska Installment Loan and
6 Sales Act without having obtained the license required by the act, with
7 intent to evade the provisions of the act, is guilty of a Class I
8 misdemeanor.
9 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary,
10 any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the obligation
11 of any contract.
12 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
13 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
14 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
15 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
16 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
17 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
18 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
19 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
20 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
21 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
22 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
23 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
24 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
25 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
26 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
27 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
28 date judgment is obtained.

2 (5)(a) The director may deny any proposed acquisition if:
3 (i) The financial condition of any acquiring person is such as might
4 jeopardize the financial stability of the acquired licensee;
5 (ii) The character and general fitness of any acquiring person or of
6 any of the proposed management personnel indicate that the acquired
7 installment sales licensee or installment loan licensee would not be
8 operated honestly, fairly, or efficiently within the purposes of the
9 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act; or
10 (iii) Any acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish
11 all information required by the department.
12 (b) The director shall notify the acquiring party in writing of
13 denial of the acquisition. The notice shall provide a statement of the
14 basis for the denial.
15 (c) Within fifteen business days after receipt of written notice of

5 buyer or his or her assignee may recover under the act in a civil suit
6 brought within one year after the due date, or any extension thereof, of

9 licensee may apply such payment first to all accrued charges in full up
10 to the date of such payment.
11 (1) An installment sales license may be renewed annually on or
12 before December 31 by paying to the director a fee of one hundred fifty
13 dollars, plus one hundred dollars for each branch office, if applicable,
14 and any processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 and
15 by submitting such information as the director may require to indicate
16 any material change in the information contained in the original
17 application or succeeding renewal applications, including a copy of the
18 licensee's most recent annual audit.
19 (2) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license at any time by
20 delivering to the director written notice of the surrender. The
21 department shall cancel the license following such surrender.
22 (3) If a licensee fails to renew its license and does not
23 voluntarily surrender the license pursuant to this section, the
24 department may issue a notice of expiration of the license to the
25 licensee in lieu of revocation proceedings.
26 Sec. 23. (1) Except as provided in section 45-350 and subsection
27 (6) of this section, every installment loan licensee may make loans and
28 may contract for and receive on such loans charges at a rate not
29 exceeding twenty-four percent per annum on that part of the unpaid
30 principal balance on any loan not in excess of one thousand dollars, and
31 twenty-one percent per annum on any remainder of such unpaid principal
-49-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 balance. Except for loans secured by mobile homes, an installment loan
2 licensee may not make loans for a period in excess of one hundred forty-
3 five months if the amount of the loan is greater than three thousand
4 dollars but less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Unless otherwise
5 allowed for by law, charges on loans made under the Nebraska Installment
6 Loan and Sales Act shall not be paid, deducted, or received in advance.
7 The contracting for, charging of, or receiving of charges as provided for
8 in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed to be the payment,
9 deduction, or receipt of such charges in advance.
10 (2) When the loan contract requires repayment in substantially equal
11 and consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined,
12 the installment loan licensee may, at the time the loan is made,
13 precompute the charges at the agreed rate on scheduled unpaid principal
14 balances according to the terms of the contract and add such charges to
15 the principal of the loan. Every payment may be applied to the combined
16 total of principal and precomputed charges until the contract is fully
17 paid. All payments made on account of any loan except for default and
18 deferment charges shall be deemed to be applied to the unpaid
19 installments in the order in which the unpaid installments are due. The
20 portion of the precomputed charges applicable to any particular month of
21 the contract, as originally scheduled or following a deferment, shall be
22 that proportion of such precomputed charges, excluding any adjustment
23 made for a first installment period of more than one month and any
24 adjustment made for deferment, which the balance of the contract
25 scheduled to be outstanding during such month bears to the sum of all
26 monthly balances originally scheduled to be outstanding by the contract.
27 This section shall not limit or restrict the manner of calculating
28 charges, whether by way of add-on, single annual rate, or otherwise, if
29 the rate of charges does not exceed what is permitted by this section.
30 Charges may be contracted for and earned at a single annual rate, except
31 that the total charges from such rate shall not be greater than the total
-50-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 charges from the several rates otherwise applicable to the different
2 portions of the unpaid balance according to subsection (1) of this
3 section. All loan contracts made pursuant to this subsection are subject
4 to the following adjustments:
5 (a) Notwithstanding the requirement for substantially equal and
6 consecutive monthly installments, the first installment period may not
7 exceed one month by more than twenty-one days and may not fall short of
8 one month by more than eleven days. The charges for each day exceeding
9 one month shall be one-thirtieth of the charges which would be applicable
10 to a first installment period of one month. The charge for extra days in
11 the first installment period may be added to the first installment and
12 such charges for such extra days shall be excluded in computing any
13 rebate;
14 (b) If prepayment in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise occurs
15 before the first installment due date, the charges shall be recomputed at
16 the rate of charges contracted for in accordance with this section upon
17 the actual unpaid principal balance of the loan for the actual time
18 outstanding by applying the payment, or payments, first to charges at the
19 agreed rate and the remainder to the principal. The amount of charges so
20 computed shall be retained in lieu of all precomputed charges;
21 (c) If a contract is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
22 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
23 receive a rebate of an amount which is not less than the amount obtained
24 by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or,
25 if deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according
26 to the actuarial method, the rate of charge contracted for in accordance
27 with this section. The licensee may round the rate of charge to the
28 nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently
29 used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any
30 default and deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted
31 from any rebate. No rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment.
-51-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 No rebate of less than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the
2 maturity of the contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If
3 judgment is obtained before the final installment date, the contract
4 balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be required for
5 prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained;
6 (d) If any installment on a precomputed or interest-bearing loan is
7 unpaid in full for ten or more consecutive days, Sundays and holidays
8 included, after it is due, the licensee may charge and collect a default
9 charge not exceeding an amount equal to five percent of such installment.
10 If any installment payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed
11 order which is not honored because of insufficient funds, no account, or
12 any other reason except an error of a third party to the loan contract,
13 the licensee may charge and collect a fifteen-dollar bad check charge.
14 Such default or bad check charges may be collected when due or at any
15 time thereafter;
16 (e) If, as of an installment due date, the payment date of all
17 wholly unpaid installments is deferred one or more full months and the
18 maturity of the contract is extended for a corresponding period, the
19 licensee may charge and collect a deferment charge not exceeding the
20 charge applicable to the first of the installments deferred, multiplied
21 by the number of months in the deferment period. The deferment period is
22 that period during which no payment is made or required by reason of such
23 deferment. The deferment charge may be collected at the time of deferment
24 or at any time thereafter. The portion of the precomputed charges
25 applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following the
26 deferment period shall remain the same as that applicable to such balance
27 and periods under the original loan contract. No installment on which a
28 default charge has been collected, or on account of which any partial
29 payment has been made, shall be deferred or included in the computation
30 of the deferment charge unless such default charge or partial payment is
31 refunded to the borrower or credited to the deferment charge. Any payment
-52-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 received at the time of deferment may be applied first to the deferment
2 charge and the remainder, if any, applied to the unpaid balance of the
3 contract, except that if such payment is sufficient to pay, in addition
4 to the appropriate deferment charge, any installment which is in default
5 and the applicable default charge, it shall be first so applied and any
6 such installment shall not be deferred or subject to the deferment
7 charge. If a loan is prepaid in full during the deferment period, the
8 borrower shall receive, in addition to the required rebate, a rebate of
9 that portion of the deferment charge applicable to any unexpired full
10 month or months of such deferment period; and
11 (f) If two or more full installments are in default for one full
12 month or more at any installment date and if the contract so provides,
13 the installment loan licensee may reduce the contract balance by the
14 rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of such
15 installment date and the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be
16 the unpaid principal balance and thereafter in lieu of charging,
17 collecting, receiving, and applying charges as provided in this
18 subsection, charges may be charged, collected, received, and applied at
19 the agreed rate as otherwise provided by this section until the loan is
20 fully paid.
21 (3) The charges, as referred to in subsection (1) of this section,
22 shall not be compounded. The charging, collecting, and receiving of
23 charges as provided in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed
24 compounding. If part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is
25 the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount
26 payable under such loan contract may include any unpaid charges on the
27 prior loan which have accrued within sixty days before the making of such
28 loan contract and may include the balance remaining after giving the
29 rebate required by subsection (2) of this section. Except as provided in
30 subsection (2) of this section, charges shall (a) be computed and paid
31 only as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal balance or
-53-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 portions thereof and (b) be computed on the basis of the number of days
2 actually elapsed. For purposes of computing charges, whether at the
3 maximum rate or less, a month shall be that period of time from any date
4 in a month to the corresponding date in the next month but if there is no
5 such corresponding date then to the last day of the next month, and a day
6 shall be considered one-thirtieth of a month when computation is made for
7 a fraction of a month.
8 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section,
9 in addition to that provided for under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
10 Sales Act, no further or other amount whatsoever shall be directly or
11 indirectly charged, contracted for, or received. If any amount, in excess
12 of the charges permitted, is charged, contracted for, or received, the
13 loan contract shall not on that account be void, but the installment loan
14 licensee shall have no right to collect or receive any interest or other
15 charges whatsoever. If such interest or other charges have been collected
16 or contracted for, the licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest
17 and other charges collected and shall not collect any interest or other
18 charges contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as
19 liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if
20 found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto,
21 including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall
22 be found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of
23 the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a
24 bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
25 adopted to avoid any such error.
26 (5) A borrower may be required to pay all reasonable expenses
27 incurred in connection with the making, closing, disbursing, extending,
28 readjusting, or renewing of loans. Such expenses may include abstracting,
29 recording, releasing, and registration fees; premiums paid for nonfiling
30 insurance; premiums paid on insurance policies covering tangible personal
31 property securing the loan; amounts charged for a debt cancellation
-54-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 contract or a debt suspension contract, as agreed upon by the parties, if
2 the debt cancellation contract or debt suspension contract is a contract
3 of a financial institution or installment loan licensee and such contract
4 is sold directly by such financial institution or licensee or by an
5 unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent of such financial institution or
6 licensee in accordance with 12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part existed on
7 January 1, 2025, and the financial institution or installment loan
8 licensee is responsible for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent's
9 compliance with such part; title examinations; credit reports; survey;
10 taxes or charges imposed upon or in connection with the making and
11 recording or releasing of any mortgage; amounts charged for a guaranteed
12 asset protection waiver; and fees and expenses charged for electronic
13 title and lien services. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this
14 section, a borrower may also be required to pay a nonrefundable loan
15 origination fee not to exceed the lesser of five hundred dollars or an
16 amount equal to seven percent of that part of the original principal
17 balance of any loan not in excess of two thousand dollars and five
18 percent on that part of the original principal balance in excess of two
19 thousand dollars, if the installment loan licensee has not made another
20 loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months. If the licensee
21 has made another loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months,
22 a nonrefundable loan origination fee may only be charged on new funds
23 advanced on each successive loan. Such reasonable initial charges may be
24 collected from the borrower or included in the principal balance of the
25 loan at the time the loan is made and shall not be considered interest or
26 a charge for the use of the money loaned.
27 (6)(a) Loans secured solely by real property that are not made
28 pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property shall
29 not be subject to the limitations on the rate of interest provided in
30 subsection (1) of this section or the limitations on the nonrefundable
31 loan origination fee under subsection (5) of this section if (i) the
-55-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 principal amount of the loan is seven thousand five hundred dollars or
2 more and (ii) the sum of the principal amount of the loan and the
3 balances of all other liens against the property do not exceed one
4 hundred percent of the appraised value of the property. Acceptable
5 methods of determining appraised value shall be made by the department
6 pursuant to rule, regulation, or order.
7 (b) An origination fee on such loan shall be computed only on the
8 principal amount of the loan reduced by any portion of the principal that
9 consists of the amount required to pay off another loan made under this
10 subsection by the same licensee.
11 (c) A prepayment penalty on such loan shall be permitted only if (i)
12 the maximum amount of the penalty to be assessed is stated in writing at
13 the time the loan is made, (ii) the loan is prepaid in full within two
14 years from the date of the loan, and (iii) the loan is prepaid with money
15 other than the proceeds of another loan made by the same licensee. Such
16 prepayment penalty shall not exceed six months' interest on eighty
17 percent of the original principal balance computed at the agreed rate of
18 interest on the loan.
19 (d) An installment loan licensee making a loan pursuant to this
20 subsection may obtain an interest in any fixtures attached to such real
21 property and any insurance proceeds payable in connection with such real
22 property or the loan.
23 (e) For purposes of this subsection, principal amount of the loan
24 means the total sum owed by the borrower including, but not limited to,
25 insurance premiums, loan origination fees, or any other amount that is
26 financed, except that for purposes of subdivision (6)(b) of this section,
27 loan origination fees shall not be included in calculating the principal
28 amount of the loan.
29 Sec. 24. Section 45-350, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 45-350 (1) Installment loan licensees may charge, contract for, or
-56-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 receive any amount or rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.03 or
2 45-101.04 or section 23 of this act upon any loan or upon any part or all
3 of any aggregate indebtedness of the same person. Except as provided in
4 subsection (2) of this section, the charging, contracting for, or
5 receiving of a rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.04 does not
6 exempt the licensee from compliance with the Nebraska Installment Loan
7 and Sales Act.
8 (2)(a) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
9 subdivision (4) of section 45-101.04 are not subject to the Nebraska
10 Installment Loan and Sales Act if such loans are not made on real
11 property.
12 (b) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
13 subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property are not subject to
14 the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. An installment loan licensee
15 making such loans shall comply with and be subject to the Residential
16 Mortgage Licensing Act with respect to such loans, except that the
17 installment loan licensee shall not be required to obtain a mortgage
18 banker license under the Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
19 (c) Any mortgage loan originator who works as an employee or
20 independent agent of an installment loan licensee shall be required to
21 obtain a mortgage loan originator license and shall be subject to the
22 Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
23 (3) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(a) of section 23 of this
24 act, no installment loan licensee shall enter into any loan contract
25 under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act under which the
26 borrower agrees to make any payment of principal more than thirty-six
27 calendar months from the date of making such contract when the principal
28 balance is not more than three thousand dollars. Every loan contract
29 precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 23 of this act shall
30 provide for repayment of principal and charges in installments which
31 shall be payable at approximately equal periodic intervals of time and so
-57-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 arranged that no installment is substantially greater in amount than any
2 preceding installment. When necessary in order to facilitate payment in
3 accordance with the borrower's principal source of income or when the
4 loan contract is not precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 23
5 of this act, the payment schedule may reduce or omit installment
6 payments. Any loan contract made in violation of this section, either
7 knowingly or without the exercise of due care to prevent the violation,
8 shall not on that account be void, but the licensee has no right to
9 collect or receive any interest or charges on such loan. If any interest
10 or other charges have been collected or contracted for, the installment
11 loan licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest and other charges
12 collected and shall not collect thereafter any interest or other charges
13 contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as liquidated
14 damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if found
15 liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto, including
16 reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall be found
17 liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of the
18 evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
19 fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
20 adopted to avoid any such error.
21 (1) Renewal of a license originally granted under the Nebraska
22 Installment Sales Act may be denied or a license may be suspended or
23 revoked by the director on the following grounds: (a) Material
24 misstatement in the application for license; (b) willful failure to
25 comply with any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act relating
26 to installment contracts; (c) defrauding any buyer to the buyer's damage;
27 or (d) fraudulent misrepresentation, circumvention, or concealment by the
28 licensee through whatever subterfuge or device of any of the material
29 particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to
30 the buyer under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
31 (2) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
-58-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the
2 suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or
3 trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a
4 licensed partnership or limited liability company has so acted or failed
5 to act as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such
6 party as an individual.
7 (3) No license shall be denied, suspended, or revoked except after
8 hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The director
9 shall give the licensee at least ten days' written notice, in the form of
10 an order to show cause, of the time and place of such hearing by either
11 registered or certified mail addressed to the principal place of business
12 in this state of such licensee. Such notice shall contain the grounds of
13 complaint against the licensee. Any order suspending or revoking such
14 license shall recite the grounds upon which the same is based. The order
15 shall be entered upon the records of the director and shall not be
16 effective until after thirty days' written notice thereof given after
17 such entry forwarded by either registered or certified mail to the
18 licensee at such principal place of business.
19 (4) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
20 of any license shall not impair or affect the obligation of any lawful
21 installment contract acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
22 (5) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
23 of any license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts
24 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
25 surrender or affect liability for any fines which may be levied against
26 the licensee or any of its officers, directors, shareholders, partners,
27 or members pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act for acts
28 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
29 surrender.
30 (6) Any person, licensee, or applicant considering himself or
31 herself aggrieved by an order of the director entered under the
-59-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 provisions of this section may appeal the order. The appeal shall be in
2 accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
3 Sec. 25. Section 45-351, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 45-351 (1) Except as otherwise provided by the Nebraska Installment
6 Loan and Sales Act or other law, an installment loan licensee shall not
7 contact any individual who is not living, residing, or present in the
8 household of the borrower regarding the borrower's obligation to pay a
9 debt, other than the borrower's spouse, the borrower's attorney, another
10 creditor, or a credit reporting agency.
11 (2) The borrower may waive the benefits of this section at any time
12 by giving consent if such consent is given at a time subsequent to the
13 date the debt arises.
14 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
15 business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in the business
16 of a sales finance company subject to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
17 The director shall have the power to appoint examiners who shall, under
18 his or her direction, investigate the installment contracts and business
19 and examine the books and records of licensees when the director shall so
20 determine. Such examinations shall not be conducted more often than
21 annually except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
22 (2) The director or his or her duly authorized representative shall
23 have the power to make such investigations as he or she shall deem
24 necessary, and to the extent necessary for this purpose, he or she may
25 examine such licensee or any other person and shall have the power to
26 compel the production of all relevant books, records, accounts, and
27 documents.
28 (3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the
29 books and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set
30 forth in sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of
31 an investigation of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs
-60-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 shall be paid within thirty days after receipt of billing.
2 (4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or
3 inquiry request for information from the department, the licensee shall
4 respond within twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to
5 respond as required by this subsection shall constitute a separate
6 violation.
7 (5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing
8 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has
9 willfully and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska
10 Installment Sales Act, any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated
11 under the act, or any order issued by the director under the act, the
12 director may order such person to pay (a) an administrative fine of not
13 more than one thousand dollars for each separate violation and (b) the
14 costs of investigation. The department shall remit fines collected under
15 this subsection to the State Treasurer for distribution in accordance
16 with Article VII, section 5, of the Constitution of Nebraska.
17 (6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
18 investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien
19 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
20 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil
21 action by the director. The lien shall attach to the real property of
22 such person when notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real
23 property in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
24 real property is located. The lien shall attach to any other property of
25 such person when notice of the lien is filed against the property in the
26 manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and
27 costs shall constitute a separate violation of the Nebraska Installment
28 Sales Act.
29 Sec. 26. Section 45-352, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 45-352 (1) Section 45-351 shall not prohibit the licensee from:
-61-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (a) Contacting any person in order to discover property belonging to
2 the borrower that may be seized to satisfy a debt that has been reduced
3 to judgment;
4 (b) Making amicable demand and filing suit on the debt; or
5 (c) Contacting persons related to the borrower if permission is
6 specifically given in writing at the time the debt arises or at any time
7 after such debt arises.
8 (2) An installment loan licensee may contact any person without the
9 borrower's consent:
10 (a) To ascertain information relating to a borrower's credit
11 worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general
12 reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or
13 expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of
14 serving as a factor in establishing the borrower's eligibility for credit
15 or insurance if such contacts are not designed to collect a delinquent
16 debt; or
17 (b) To locate the borrower when the licensee has reason to believe
18 the borrower has changed his or her employment or has moved from his or
19 her last-known address.
20 The director shall have the power to make such general rules and
21 regulations and specific rulings, demands, and findings as may be
22 necessary for the proper conduct of the business licensed under the
23 Nebraska Installment Sales Act, and the enforcement of the act, in
24 addition thereto and not inconsistent therewith.
25 Sec. 27. Section 45-353, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 45-353 (1) An agreement of the parties to a loan, with respect to
28 default on the part of the borrower, is enforceable only to the extent
29 that:
30 (a) The borrower fails to make a payment on the loan or other
31 charges required by the agreement; or
-62-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (b) The prospect of payment, performance, or realization of
2 collateral is significantly impaired. The burden of establishing the
3 prospect of significant impairment is on the installment loan licensee.
4 (2) If the borrower has defaulted on his or her promise to pay and
5 if he or she has given specific notice in writing, by registered or
6 certified mail, instructing the licensee to cease further contacts with
7 the borrower in regard to the indebtedness, the installment loan licensee
8 shall, after such notice, except as provided in section 45-352, limit
9 contacts to one notice per month by mail. No notice shall be designed to
10 threaten action not otherwise permitted by law.
11 (3) With respect to a loan, after a borrower has been in default for
12 ten days for failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
13 licensee may give the borrower the notice described in this section. An
14 installment loan licensee gives notice to the borrower under this section
15 when it delivers the notice to the borrower or delivers or mails the
16 notice to the last-known address of the borrower's residence.
17 (4) The notice shall be in writing and shall conspicuously state:
18 (a) The name, address, and telephone number of the installment loan
19 licensee to which payment is to be made;
20 (b) A brief identification of the loan;
21 (c) The borrower's right to cure the default;
22 (d) The amount of payment and date by which payment must be made to
23 cure the default; and
24 (e) That any credit insurance issued in connection with the loan
25 contract may be canceled unless the borrower cures the default.
26 (5) With respect to a loan, after a default consisting only of the
27 borrower's failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
28 licensee may neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the
29 obligation nor take possession of collateral, except voluntarily
30 surrendered collateral, because of such default until twenty days after a
31 notice of the borrower's right to cure is given. The borrower shall have
-63-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 twenty days after the notice is given to cure any default consisting of a
2 failure to make the required payment by tendering the amount of all
3 unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without acceleration, plus any
4 unpaid charges. Cure restores the borrower to his or her rights under the
5 agreement as though the default had not occurred.
6 (6) With respect to defaults on the same obligation after an
7 installment loan licensee has once given a notice of the borrower's right
8 to cure, the borrower shall have no further right to cure and the
9 installment loan licensee has no obligation to proceed against the
10 borrower or the collateral.
11 (7) Upon default by a borrower with respect to a loan, unless the
12 borrower voluntarily surrenders possession of the collateral to the
13 licensee, the licensee may take possession of the collateral without
14 judicial process only if possession can be taken without entry into a
15 dwelling or a locked, unoccupied motor vehicle, and without the use of
16 force or other breach of the peace.
17 (1) Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any
18 person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate any of the
19 provisions of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act, he or she may, in
20 addition to all actions provided for in the act and without prejudice
21 thereto, enter an order requiring such person to desist or to refrain
22 from such violation. An action may also be brought, on the relation of
23 the Attorney General or the director, to enjoin such person from engaging
24 in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in
25 furtherance thereof.
26 (2) In any such action an order or judgment may be entered awarding
27 such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition
28 to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining
29 order or injunction, the court, in which such action is brought, shall
30 have power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the
31 property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
-64-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court
2 may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska
3 Installment Sales Act through or by means of the use of such property and
4 business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, shall have such
5 powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up
6 and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from time to
7 time, be conferred upon him or her by the court.
8 Sec. 28. Section 45-354, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
9 2024, is amended to read:
10 45-354 (1) A borrower is not liable for a deficiency unless the
11 licensee has disposed of the collateral in good faith and in a
12 commercially reasonable manner.
13 (2) If the installment loan licensee takes possession or voluntarily
14 accepts surrender of goods in which the licensee has a security interest
15 to secure a loan and at the time thereof the unpaid balance due on the
16 loan is three thousand dollars or less, the borrower is not personally
17 liable to the installment loan licensee for the unpaid balance of the
18 debt arising from the loan and the licensee's duty to dispose of the
19 collateral is governed by the provisions on disposition of collateral,
20 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code.
21 (3) The borrower may be liable in damages to the installment loan
22 licensee if the borrower has wrongfully damaged the collateral or if,
23 after default, failure to cure, and demand, the borrower has wrongfully
24 failed to make the collateral available to the installment loan licensee.
25 (4) If the installment loan licensee elects to bring an action
26 against the borrower for a debt arising from a loan, when under this
27 section the installment loan licensee would not be entitled to a
28 deficiency judgment if the installment loan licensee took possession of
29 the collateral, and obtains judgment, (a) the installment loan licensee
30 may not take possession of the collateral and (b) the collateral is not
31 subject to levy or sale on execution or similar proceedings pursuant to

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 authority requirements under the Motor Club Services Act.
2 (3) Notwithstanding section 23 of this act and section 45-350, any
3 gain or advantage, in the form of commission or otherwise, to the
4 licensee or to any employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee from
5 such insurance or motor club service or the sale thereof shall not be
6 deemed to be an additional or further charge in connection with the loan
7 contract. The insurance premium or motor club service contract fee may be
8 collected from the borrower or financed through the loan contract at the
9 time the loan is made.
10 (4)(a) Insurance permitted under this section shall be obtained

29 shall be retained by the holder of the loan contract.
30 (6) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this
31 section is canceled or the premium or motor club service contract fee
-73-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 adjusted during the term of the loan contract, any refund of the
2 insurance premium or motor club service contract fee plus the unearned
3 interest thereon received by the holder shall be credited by the holder
4 to the loan contract or otherwise refunded, except to the extent applied
5 toward payment for similar insurance or motor club service protecting the
6 interests of the buyer and the holder or either of them.
7 (7) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this
8 section is canceled due to the payment of all sums for which the buyer is
9 liable under a loan contract, the holder of the loan contract shall, upon
10 receipt of payment of all sums due, send notice to the buyer within
11 fifteen business days after payment of the sums due of the name, address,

13 the insurance contract or motor club service contract or the party
14 responsible for any refund and notice that the buyer may be eligible for
15 a refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of the

17 contract previously credited the refund of the insurance premium or motor
18 club service contract fee to the loan contract or otherwise refunded the
19 insurance premium or motor club service contract fee to the buyer.
20 (8) The licensee shall, at the time the loan is made, give to the

22 insurance procured by or through the licensee, which includes the amount
23 of any premium which the borrower has paid or is obligated to pay, the
24 expiration date of the policy, and a concise description of the risks
25 insured. If a borrower procures insurance by or through a licensee, the
26 licensee shall deliver to the borrower within fifteen days after the
27 making of the loan an executed copy of the insurance policy or
28 certificate of insurance.
29 Sec. 34. (1) Licensees holding an active installment loan license
30 may make preauthorized loans. Preauthorized loan means a loan made by a
31 licensee pursuant to an agreement between the licensee and the borrower
-74-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 whereby:
2 (a) The licensee may permit the borrower to obtain advances of money
3 from the licensee from time to time or the licensee may advance money on
4 behalf of the borrower from time to time as directed by the borrower;
5 (b) The amount of each advance and permitted charge and cost is
6 debited to the borrower's account and payments and other credits are
7 credited to the same account;
8 (c) The charges are computed on the unpaid principal balance or
9 balances of the account from time to time;
10 (d) The borrower has the privilege of paying the account in full at
11 any time or, if the account is not in default, in monthly installments or
12 fixed or determinable amounts as provided in the agreement; and
13 (e) The loan agreement expressly states that it covers preauthorized
14 loans. Preauthorized loan does not mean a transaction, resulting in
15 either a credit or a debit to the borrower's account, which is initiated
16 by the use or application of a plastic, metal, or other type of credit or
17 transaction card.
18 (2) For purposes of computations relating to preauthorized loans
19 made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, billing
20 cycle means the time interval between periodic billing dates. A billing
21 cycle shall be considered monthly if the closing date of the cycle is the
22 same date each month or does not vary by more than four days from such
23 date.
24 Sec. 35. (1) A licensee may make preauthorized loans and may
25 contract for and receive charges on such loans as set forth in subsection
26 (1) of section 23 of this act, subject to the following requirements:
27 (a) A licensee shall not compound charges by adding any unpaid
28 charges authorized by section 23 of this act or this section to the
29 unpaid principal balance of the borrower's account, except that the
30 unpaid principal balance may include additional charges for credit life
31 insurance or credit disability insurance provided in connection with the
-75-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 preauthorized loan, subject to the requirements and restrictions
2 contained in section 36 of this act;
3 (b) Charges authorized by section 23 of this act or this section
4 shall be deemed not to exceed the maximum charges permitted by such
5 sections if such charges are computed in each billing cycle by any of the
6 following methods:
7 (i) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
8 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the daily unpaid
9 principal balance of the account, in which case each daily rate is
10 determined by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by twelve and
11 dividing by three hundred sixty-five;
12 (ii) By multiplying each graduated monthly rate by the applicable
13 portion of the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in
14 the billing cycle, in which case the average daily unpaid principal
15 balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided
16 by the number of days in the cycle; or
17 (iii) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
18 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the average
19 daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in
20 which case each daily rate is determined by multiplying the authorized
21 monthly rate by twelve and dividing by three hundred sixty-five, and the
22 average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid
23 each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in the cycle; and
24 (c) For each method of computation set forth in this section, the
25 billing cycle shall be monthly and the unpaid principal balance on any
26 day shall be determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the
27 beginning of that day all advances and other permissible amounts charged
28 to the borrower and deducting all payments and other credits made or
29 received that day.
30 (2) The borrower under a preauthorized loan may at any time pay all
31 or any part of the unpaid balance in his or her account, or, if the
-76-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 account is not in default, the borrower may pay the unpaid principal
2 balance in monthly installments. Minimum monthly payment requirements
3 shall be determined by the licensee and set forth in the preauthorized
4 loan agreement, except that the minimum monthly payment shall not be less
5 than one and one-half percent of the average daily unpaid principal
6 balance of an account having an average daily balance of more than three
7 thousand dollars nor less than two percent of the average daily unpaid
8 principal balance of an account having an average daily balance of three
9 thousand dollars or less.
10 (3) A licensee may retain any security interest, including a
11 mortgage on real property, until the preauthorized account is terminated.
12 (4) Subsection (4) of section 45-345, subsection (3) of section
13 45-350, and section 31 of this act shall not apply to preauthorized
14 loans.
15 (5) The department may approve record-keeping systems for licensees
16 and may prescribe policies and procedures necessary to the administration
17 of preauthorized loans made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and
18 Sales Act.
19 Sec. 36. In addition to the charges permitted under section 35 of
20 this act, a licensee may contract for and receive the fees, costs, and
21 expenses permitted by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act on
22 other loans, subject to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in
23 the act with the following variations:
24 (1) If credit life or disability insurance is provided and if the
25 insured dies or becomes disabled when there is an outstanding
26 preauthorized loan indebtedness, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay
27 the total balance of the loan due on the date of the borrower's death or
28 the amount due as of the end of the previous billing cycle, whichever is
29 less, in the case of credit life insurance, or all minimum payments which
30 become due on the loan during the covered period of disability in the
31 case of credit disability insurance. The additional charge for credit
-77-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 life insurance or credit disability insurance shall be calculated in each
2 billing cycle by applying the current monthly premium rate for such
3 insurance, as such rate may be determined by the Director of Insurance,
4 to the unpaid balances in the borrower's account, using either of the
5 methods specified in section 35 of this act for the calculation of loan
6 charges;
7 (2) No credit life or disability insurance written in connection
8 with a preauthorized loan shall be canceled by the licensee because of
9 delinquency of the borrower in the making of the required minimum
10 payments on the loan unless one or more of such payments is past due for

18 or damage to property must be reasonable in relation to the character and

16 goods or services is not made at the time of the execution of the
17 contract, the identifying numbers or marks of the goods, or similar
18 information, and the due date of the first installment may be inserted in
19 the contract after its execution.
20 (4) If a seller proffers an installment sales contract as part of a
21 transaction which delays or cancels, or promises to delay or cancel, the
22 payment of the time-price differential on the contract if the buyer pays
23 the basic time price, cash price, or cash sale price within a certain
24 period of time, the seller shall, in clear and conspicuous writing,

26 inform the buyer of the exact date by which the buyer must pay the basic

28 the payment of the time-price differential. The seller or any subsequent
29 purchaser of the installment sales contract, including a sales finance
30 company, shall not be allowed to change such date.
31 (5) Upon written request from the buyer, the holder of an
-81-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 installment sales contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written
2 statement of the dates and amounts of payments and the total amount
3 unpaid under such contract. A buyer shall be given a written receipt for
4 any payment when made in cash.
5 (6) After payment of all sums for which the buyer is obligated under
6 a contract, the holder shall deliver or mail to the buyer at his or her
7 last-known address one or more good and sufficient instruments or copies
8 thereof to acknowledge payment in full and shall release all security in
9 the goods and mark canceled and return to the buyer the original
10 agreement or copy thereof or instruments or copies thereof signed by the
11 buyer. For purposes of this section, a copy shall meet the requirements
12 of section 25-12,112.
13 Sec. 39. (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law,
14 the time-price differential for any goods or services sold under an
15 installment sales contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual
16 percentage rate and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to
17 exceed eighteen percent per annum, except that a minimum time-price
18 differential of ten dollars may be charged on any installment sales
19 contract.
20 (b) Origination fees may be required to be made by the buyer,

22 (i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the installment
23 sales contract, to pay an origination fee in an amount not to exceed ten
24 dollars, except that if the installment sales contract is for an

26 commercial agriculture or if the installment sales contract is for an
27 installment sale of industrial machinery or equipment the buyer may be
28 required to pay (A) an origination fee of not to exceed one hundred

-82-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (ii) The origination fee shall be refundable if the installment
2 sales contract is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination
3 fee may be collected from the buyer or included in the principal balance
4 of the installment sales contract at the time the contract is made and
5 shall not be considered interest or a time-price differential.
6 (c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act prohibits
7 a seller or holder of an installment sales contract from contracting for,
8 computing, and charging a time-price differential based upon the
9 application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the
10 number of days actually elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used
11 for the purpose of calculating the time-price differential, the time-
12 price balance, the amount of each installment, and the time-sale price.
13 (d) When the installment sales contract is payable in substantially
14 equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential
15 shall be computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined
16 under section 38 of this act, from the date of the contract until the due
17 date of the final installment, notwithstanding that the time-price
18 balance is required to be paid in installments.
19 (2) When an installment sales contract provides for payment other
20 than in substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the
21 time-price differential may be at a rate which will provide the same
22 return as is permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts
23 under subdivision (1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the
24 schedule of payments.
25 (3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide
26 for payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each
27 installment or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall
28 be determined.
29 Sec. 40. (1) The amount, if any, included for insurance, which may
30 be purchased by the holder of the contract, shall not exceed the
31 applicable premium rates chargeable in accordance with filings, if any,
-83-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 with the Department of Insurance. If dual interest insurance on the goods
2 is purchased by the holder, it shall, within thirty days after execution
3 of the installment sales contract, send or cause to be sent to the buyer
4 a policy or policies or certificate of insurance, written by an insurance
5 company authorized to do business in this state, clearly setting forth
6 the amount of the premium, the kind or kinds of insurance, the coverages,
7 and all the terms and conditions of the contract or contracts of
8 insurance.
9 (2) If any insurance is canceled or the premium adjusted during the
10 term of the installment sales contract, any refund of the insurance
11 premium plus the unearned time-price differential thereon received by the
12 holder shall be credited by the holder to the last maturing installment
13 of the contract except to the extent applied toward payment for similar
14 insurance protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder or either
15 of them.
16 (3) If any insurance is canceled due to the payment of all sums for
17 which the buyer is liable under an installment sales contract, the holder
18 of the installment sales contract shall, upon receipt of payment of all
19 sums due, send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days of the
20 name, address, and telephone number of the insurance company which issued
21 the insurance contract or the party responsible for any refund, and
22 notice that the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice
23 shall be retained by the holder of the installment sales contract. This
24 subsection does not apply if the holder of the loan contract previously
25 credited the refund of the insurance premium to the loan contract or
26 otherwise refunded the insurance premium to the buyer.
27 (4) The holder may also purchase nonfiling insurance and charge a
28 reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges
29 prescribed by law which would have been paid to public officials for
30 filing, perfecting, releasing, and satisfying any lien or security
31 interest in the goods or services.
-84-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 Sec. 41. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the
2 contrary, any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the
3 obligation of any contract.
4 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
5 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
6 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
7 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
8 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
9 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
10 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
11 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
12 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
13 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
14 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
15 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
16 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
17 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
18 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
19 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
20 date judgment is obtained.
21 Sec. 42. (1) Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods
22 or services from a seller from whom such buyer has previously purchased
23 goods or services under one or more installment sales contracts and the
24 amounts under such contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price
25 thereof have not been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may be
26 included in and consolidated with one or more of the prior contract or
27 contracts. A memorandum of such additional purchases shall be prepared by
28 the seller and inserted in or attached to the seller's counterpart of the
29 contract and shall set forth:
30 (a) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the
31 additional goods or services sold and all the information with respect to
-85-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 the additional purchase required by section 38 of this act to be included
2 in an installment sales contract;
3 (b) The consolidated time-price balance to be paid by the buyer; and
4 (c) The revised payments.
5 (2) A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as
6 provided in and subject to section 38 of this act. When such subsequent
7 purchases are made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such
8 subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied on previous
9 purchases.
10 (3) Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment sales
11 contract shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases
12 in the same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the
13 various purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred
14 payment is increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the
15 subsequent payments, at the seller's option, may be deemed to be
16 allocated as follows: An amount equal to the original installment payment
17 to the previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The
18 amount of any initial payment or downpayment on the subsequent purchase
19 shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase. This
20 section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or other
21 merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or to
22 repairs or services in connection therewith rendered by the seller at the
23 buyer's request.
24 Sec. 43. (1) An installment sales contract may provide and the
25 holder thereof may collect, in addition to any time-price differential, a
26 delinquency charge on each installment in default for a period of not
27 less than fifteen days, if provided for in the contract, not in excess of
28 five percent of each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is
29 less, or, in lieu thereof, interest after maturity on each such
30 installment not exceeding the highest permissible contract rate. If the
31 time-price differential is computed by application of the rate charged to
-86-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually elapsed,
2 such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent of each installment
3 or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any installment payment is
4 made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is not honored
5 because of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason except an
6 error of a third party to the contract, the holder may charge and collect
7 a fee of not more than fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such
8 fee may be collected when due or at any time thereafter.
9 (2) When an installment sales contract is for a commercial or
10 business purpose (a) a delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of
11 each unpaid installment may be contracted for and received and (b) the
12 holder of any check or draft or similar order which is not honored for
13 any reason, except for error of a third party, may charge and collect a
14 fee as stated in the contract. As used in this section, commercial or
15 business purpose means primarily for a purpose other than a personal,
16 family, or household purpose.
17 Sec. 44. The holder of a retail installment sales contract may,
18 upon agreement with the buyer:
19 (1) Extend the scheduled due date or defer the scheduled payment of
20 any installment payment under the retail installment sales contract; and
21 (2) Charge and collect a reasonable flat service fee for such
22 extension or deferment in addition to the time-price differential
23 calculated for the period of such extension or deferment at the rate
24 originally agreed upon in the retail installment sales contract on the
25 outstanding balance.
26 Sec. 45. (1) If any seller or sales finance company, in the making
27 or collection of an installment sales contract, shall, directly or
28 indirectly, contract for, take, or receive charges in excess of those
29 authorized by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act except as a
30 result of an accidental and bona fide error, such contract shall be void
31 and uncollectible as to (a) all of the excessive portion of the time-
-87-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 price differential, (b) the first one thousand dollars of the time-price
2 differential authorized by section 39 of this act, and (c) the first four
3 thousand dollars of the principal of the contract.
4 (2) If any seller or sales finance company violates any provision of
5 the act, other than the violations described in subsection (1) of this
6 section, except as a result of an accidental and bona fide error, such
7 installment sales contract shall be void and uncollectible as to the
8 first five hundred dollars of the time-price differential and the first
9 one thousand dollars of the principal of such contract. If any of such
10 money has been paid by the buyer, such buyer or his or her assignee may
11 recover under the act in a civil suit brought within one year after the
12 due date, or any extension thereof, of the last installment of the
13 contract.
14 Sec. 46. (1) A licensee shall not refuse to enter into a loan or
15 impose finance charges or other terms or conditions of credit more
16 onerous than those regularly extended by that licensee to borrowers of
17 similar economic backgrounds because of the age, color, creed, national
18 origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sex, marital status, or
19 disability of the borrower or because the borrower receives public
20 assistance, social security benefits, pension benefits, or the like.
21 (2) No licensee shall conduct the business of making loans under the
22 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act within any office, room, or place
23 of business in which any other business is solicited or engaged in, or in
24 association or conjunction with any other business, if the director finds
25 that the other business is of such nature that the conducting of such
26 other business tends to conceal evasion of the act or of the rules and
27 regulations adopted and promulgated under the act. In such case, the
28 director shall order such licensee in writing to cease and desist from
29 such conduct.
30 (3) No licensee shall, directly or indirectly, require a borrower as
31 a condition of granting a loan to such borrower to reaffirm or otherwise
-88-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 obligate the borrower to pay a former debt to the licensee which has been
2 discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
3 (4) Any person who makes a false statement to secure a loan is
4 guilty of a Class III misdemeanor. The punishment shall not be exacted,
5 however, when such a loan is made after the licensee is aware of the
6 falsity of the statement.
7 (5) No licensee or other person subject to the Nebraska Installment
8 Loan and Sales Act shall advertise, print, display, publish, distribute,
9 or broadcast or cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed,
10 published, distributed, or broadcast in any manner whatsoever any false,
11 misleading, or deceptive statement or representation with regard to the
12 rates, terms, or conditions for the lending of money, credit, goods, or
13 things in action. The director may order any licensee to cease and desist
14 from any conduct which he or she finds to be a violation of this section.
15 The director may require that rates of charge, if stated by a licensee,
16 be stated fully and clearly in such manner as the director deems
17 necessary to prevent misunderstanding by prospective borrowers.
18 (6) No loan, made outside this state, in the amount or of the value
19 of three thousand dollars or less, for which a greater rate of interest,
20 consideration, or charges than is permitted by section 45-350 has been
21 charged, contracted for, or received, shall be enforced in this state.
22 Every person participating in such loan in this state is subject to the
23 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, except that the act shall not
24 apply to loans legally made in any state under and in accordance with a
25 regulatory small loan law similar in principle to such act.
26 (7) In connection with the collection of any loan, a licensee may
27 not:
28 (a) Use or threaten to use violence;
29 (b) Use obscene or profane language;
30 (c) Cause a telephone to ring or engage a person in telephone

12 and regulations or an order of the director.

16 Sec. 49. Any person violating subsection (4) of section 45-345,
17 section 23 of this act, section 45-356, or section 33 of this act is
18 guilty of a Class II misdemeanor. If, in the making of, or collection on,
19 any loan contract, any act is done which constitutes a Class II
20 misdemeanor under this section, that loan shall not be void, but the
21 licensee shall have no right to collect or receive any interest or
22 charges whatsoever. If any interest or other charges have been collected,
23 the licensee shall forfeit and refund to the borrower all interest and
24 other charges collected on the loan involved and shall not collect
25 thereafter any interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter
26 due on the loan involved, as liquidated damages, and the licensee or its

2 Sec. 50. Any violation of section 46 of this act, in connection

5 action, other than a class action, the borrower may recover from the
6 licensee violating section 46 of this act an award of liquidated damages
7 in an amount determined by the court, but not less than five hundred
8 dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. In any legal action brought
9 pursuant to this section in which the licensee is found liable, the court
10 shall award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the borrower. A
11 licensee is not liable under this section if the licensee notifies the
12 borrower of an error before the licensee receives from the borrower
13 written notice of the error or before the borrower has brought an action
14 under this section and the licensee corrects the error within thirty days
15 after notifying the borrower. A licensee may not be held liable in any
16 action brought under this section if the licensee shows by a
17 preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and
18 resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of
19 procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error.
20 Sec. 51. Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that
21 any person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate the

24 order requiring such person to cease and desist or to refrain from such
25 violation. An action may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney
26 General and the director, to enjoin such person from engaging in or
27 continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of
28 such violation. In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered
29 awarding such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In
30 addition to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a
31 restraining order or injunction, the court, in which such action is

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 brought, has power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for
2 the property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
3 documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court
4 may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska
5 Installment Loan and Sales Act through or by means of the use of such
6 property and business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified,
7 has such powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration,
8 winding up, and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from
9 time to time, be conferred upon the receiver by the court.
10 Sec. 52. (1) The department may order any person to cease and
11 desist whenever the department determines that the person has violated
12 any provision of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. Upon entry
13 of a cease and desist order, the director shall promptly notify the
14 affected person that such order has been entered, of the reasons for such
15 order, and that upon receipt, within fifteen business days after the date
16 of the order, of written request from the affected person a hearing will
17 be scheduled within thirty business days after the date of receipt of the
18 written request unless the parties consent to a later date or the hearing
19 officer sets a later date for good cause. If a hearing is not requested
20 and none is ordered by the director, the order shall remain in effect
21 until it is modified or vacated.
22 (2) The director may vacate or modify a cease and desist order if he
23 or she finds that the conditions which caused its entry have changed or
24 that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.
25 (3) A person aggrieved by a cease and desist order of the director
26 may obtain judicial review of the order in the manner prescribed in the
27 Administrative Procedure Act and the rules and regulations adopted and
28 promulgated by the department under the act. The director may obtain an
29 order from the district court of Lancaster County for the enforcement of
30 the cease and desist order.

9 officer, director, shareholder, partner, or member of a licensee, if the
10 director finds the licensee or any such person participated in or had
11 knowledge of any act prohibited by the Nebraska Installment Loan and
12 Sales Act or otherwise violated the act. Such administrative fine shall
13 be in addition to or separate from any fine imposed against a licensee
14 pursuant to section 45-346.
15 (2) If the director finds, after notice and hearing in accordance
16 with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has knowingly
17 committed any act prohibited by section 46 of this act or otherwise
18 violated the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act or any rule and
19 regulation or order adopted thereunder, the director may order such
20 person to pay (a) an administrative fine of not more than five thousand
21 dollars for each separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation.

23 investigation ordered pursuant to this section, a lien in the amount of
24 such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of such
25 person in this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the
26 director. The lien shall attach to the real property of such person when
27 notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real property in the
28 office of the register of deeds in the county where the real property is
29 located. The lien shall attach to any other property of such person when
30 notice of the lien is filed against the property in the manner prescribed
31 by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and costs shall constitute
