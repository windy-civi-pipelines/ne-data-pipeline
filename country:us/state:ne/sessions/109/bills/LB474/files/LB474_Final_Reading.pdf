14 loans of any type that an association may otherwise make if (a) each of
15 the lenders is either an instrumentality of the United States Government
16 or is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or, in the
17 case of another lender, the interest of the association in such loan is
18 superior to the participating interests of the other participants and (b)
19 an association whose accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit
20 Insurance Corporation which may be a federal association or an
21 association chartered by this state, or another association chartered by

2025 2025
1 8-330 Every association may require borrowing members to pay all
2 reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the making, closing,
3 disbursing, extending, readjusting, or renewing of real estate loans.
4 Such expenses may include abstract, recording, and registration fees,
5 title examinations, survey, escrow services, and taxes or charges imposed
6 upon or in connection with the making and recording of any mortgage. Such
7 reasonable charges may be collected by the association from the borrower
8 and shall not be considered interest or a charge for the use of the money
9 loaned. A charge not exceeding one percent or that allowed a federally
10 chartered association for the premature prepayment may be made. The rate
11 of interest on any loan of money shall be determined and computed upon
12 the assumption that the debt will be paid according to the agreed terms
13 and in the event the loan is paid or collected by court action prior to
14 the term of the loan, any payment charged, received, or taken as an
15 advance or forbearance which is in the nature of and taken into account
16 in the calculation of interest, shall be spread over the stated term of
17 the loan for the purpose of determining the rate of interest. Any amounts
18 paid or contracted to be paid by persons other than the borrower shall
19 not be considered interest and shall not be taken into account in the
20 calculation of interest. Interest may be paid on escrow accounts held for
21 the payment of taxes, insurance, and similar payments, if agreed to in
22 writing by the borrower and association. Loans may be made by an
23 association under a license granted it pursuant to the Nebraska
24 Installment Loan and Sales Act, to borrowing members whose loans are
25 secured by real estate, to the same extent and in the same amount as such
26 loans may lawfully be made to nonborrowing members. The association shall
27 furnish a loan settlement statement to each borrower, indicating in
28 detail the charges and fees such borrower has paid or obligated himself
29 or herself to pay to the association or to any other person in connection
30 with such loan. A copy of such statement shall be retained in the records
31 of the association.

22 of the financial institution, except that in determining the asset size
23 of a holding company or digital asset depository, the assets of any
24 financial institution or holding company otherwise assessed pursuant to
25 this section and the assets of any nationally chartered financial
26 institution shall be excluded. The assessment for digital asset
27 depositories under the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act shall be in an
28 amount to offset the costs of supervision and administration of the
29 Nebraska Financial Innovation Act. The assessment shall be a sum
30 determined by the director in accordance with section 8-606 and approved

14 Sec. 5. Section 8-820.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 8-820.01 It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the State
17 of Nebraska that for purposes of applying the federal most-favored-lender
18 doctrine, the bank credit card rate contained in section 8-820 is not
19 comparable or analogous to the small loan rate found in section 70 of
20 this act sections 45-1024 and section 45-350 45-1025. The Legislature
21 finds that the institutions making small loans and the institutions
22 administering a bank credit card are categorically different. The
23 transactions carried on by these institutions are categorically
24 different. The Legislature finds that small loan borrowers and bank
25 credit card users are not synonymous or comparable. In establishing a
26 small loan rate, the Legislature has recognized a risk factor that is
27 different and greater than other financial transactions and therefor
28 justifies the charging of a higher interest rate than installment loans,
29 personal loans, retail revolving credit plans, or bank credit card
30 interest rates.
31 Sec. 6. Section 8-2701, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

20 conduct an examination of a licensee upon reasonable written notice to

19 person of a notice of investigation or inquiry request for information
20 from the department, the licensee, authorized delegate, or other person

4 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
5 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil
6 action by the director. The lien shall attach to the real property of
7 such person when notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real
8 property in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
9 real property is located. The lien shall attach to any other property of

20 (i) The initial supplemental surety bond shall be in the amount of
21 one hundred thousand dollars; and
22 (ii) Upon filing of the mortgage report of condition required by
23 section 45-345, the person's supplemental surety bond shall be maintained

1 person meets the following conditions:
2 (i) The person maintains a surety bond as provided in subsection (1)
3 of this section for each installment loan license the person holds;
4 (ii) The person maintains a mortgage banker surety bond as provided

9 (4) Should the department determine that an installment loan
10 licensee does not maintain a supplemental surety bond in the amount
11 required by subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the department shall
12 give written notification to the licensee requiring the licensee to
13 increase the surety bond within thirty days to the amount required by
14 subsection (2) or (3) of this section.
15 (5) The bond or a substitute bond required by subsection (1) of this
16 section, applicable to all licensees under the Nebraska Installment Loan
17 and Sales Act, shall remain in effect or the licensee shall immediately
18 cease conducting licensable activity. If a licensee fails to maintain a
19 surety bond as required under this section, the department may issue a
20 notice of cancellation of the license in lieu of revocation proceedings.
21 (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the time-
22 price differential for any goods or services sold under an installment
23 contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual percentage rate
24 and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to exceed eighteen
25 percent per annum, except that a minimum time-price differential of ten
26 dollars may be charged on any installment contract.
27 (b)(i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the
28 installment contract, to pay an origination fee of not to exceed ten
29 dollars, except that if the installment contract is for an installment
30 sale of agricultural machinery or equipment for use in commercial
31 agriculture or if the installment contract is for an installment sale of
-118-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 industrial machinery or equipment the buyer may be required to pay (A) an
2 origination fee of not to exceed one hundred dollars if the cash sale
3 price is less than twenty-five thousand dollars or (B) an origination fee
4 of not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars if the cash sale price is
5 twenty-five thousand dollars or more.
6 (ii) The origination fee shall be refundable if the installment
7 contract is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination fee
8 may be collected from the buyer or included in the principal balance of
9 the installment contract at the time the contract is made and shall not
10 be considered interest or a time-price differential.
11 (c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act prohibits a seller
12 or holder of an installment contract from contracting for, computing, and
13 charging a time-price differential based upon the application of the rate
14 charged to the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually
15 elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used for the purpose of
16 calculating the time-price differential, the time-price balance, the
17 amount of each installment, and the time-sale price.
18 (d) When the installment contract is payable in substantially equal
19 and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential shall
20 be computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined under
21 the provisions of section 45-336, from the date of the contract until the
22 due date of the final installment, notwithstanding that the time-price
23 balance is required to be paid in installments.
24 (2) When an installment contract provides for payment other than in
25 substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price
26 differential may be at a rate which will provide the same return as is
27 permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts under
28 subdivision (1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the schedule of
29 payments.
30 (3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide
31 for payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each
-119-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 installment or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall
2 be determined.

4 amended to read:
5 45-339 (1) Licensees under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales

9 (2) Such application shall be on a form prescribed and furnished by
10 the director and shall be accompanied by a branch application fee, along

13 (a) Two hundred fifty dollars for an installment loan branch
14 license; and
15 (b) One hundred dollars for an installment sales branch license.
16 Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods or services
17 from a seller from whom he has previously purchased goods or services
18 under one or more installment contracts and the amounts under such
19 contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price thereof have not
20 been fully paid the subsequent purchases may be included in and
21 consolidated with one or more of the prior contract or contracts. A
22 memorandum of such additional purchases shall be prepared by the seller
23 and inserted in or attached to the seller's counterpart of the contract
24 and shall set forth:
25 (1) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the

-120-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 provided in and subject to the provisions of section 45-336. When such
2 subsequent purchases are made, the entire amount of all payments made
3 prior to such subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied
4 on previous purchases.
5 Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment contract
6 shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases in the
7 same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the various
8 purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred payment
9 is increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the subsequent
10 payments, at the seller's option, may be deemed to be allocated as
11 follows: An amount equal to the original installment payment to the
12 previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The amount of
13 any initial payment or downpayment on the subsequent purchase shall be
14 allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase. The provisions of
15 this section shall not apply to cases involving equipment, parts, or to
16 other merchandise attached or affixed to goods previously purchased, or
17 to repairs or services in connection therewith rendered by the seller at
18 the buyer's request.
19 Sec. 61. Section 45-340, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:

19 consumer.
20 (5) Any person, licensee, or applicant potentially aggrieved by an
21 order of the director entered under this section may appeal the order.
22 The appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
23 Installment contracts negotiated and entered into by mail without
24 personal solicitation by salespersons or other representatives of the
25 seller and based upon the catalog of the seller or other printed
26 solicitation of business, which is distributed and made available
27 generally to the public, if such catalog or other printed solicitation
28 clearly sets forth the cash and time-sale prices and other terms of sales
29 to be made through such medium, may be made as provided in this section.
30 All provisions of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act shall apply to such
31 sales except that the seller shall not be required to deliver a copy of

30 applicable to the conduct of the licensee's business;
31 (b) A fact or condition exists which if such fact or condition had
-123-

3 contract entered into or acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
4 (6) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
5 of any license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts
6 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or

9 partners, or members pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales
10 Act for acts committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation,
11 expiration, or surrender of the license.
12 (7) Whenever, for any cause, a license is revoked, the department
13 shall not issue another license to the licensee unless the department is
14 otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so.

16 the department shall prepare a written record which includes a transcript
17 of the evidence, the findings with respect to the evidence, the order,
18 and the reasons supporting the suspension, revocation, or denial of a

27 on each installment in default for a period of not less than fifteen
28 days, if provided for in the contract, not in excess of five percent of
29 each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less, or, in lieu
30 thereof, interest after maturity on each such installment not exceeding
31 the highest permissible contract rate. If the time-price differential is
-126-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 computed by application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal
2 balance for the number of days actually elapsed, such delinquency charge
3 may not exceed five percent of each installment or twenty-five dollars,
4 whichever is less. If any installment payment is made by a check, draft,
5 or similar signed order which is not honored because of insufficient
6 funds, no account, or any other reason except an error of a third party
7 to the contract, the holder may charge and collect a fee of not more than
8 fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such fee may be collected
9 when due or at any time thereafter.
10 When an installment contract is for a commercial or business purpose
11 (1) a delinquency charge not to exceed five percent of each unpaid
12 installment may be contracted for and received and (2) the holder of any
13 check or draft or similar order which is not honored for any reason,
14 except for error of a third party, may charge and collect a fee as stated
15 in the contract. As used in this section, commercial or business purpose
16 means primarily for a purpose other than a personal, family, or household
17 purpose.
18 Sec. 63. Section 45-342, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

20 45-342 Any person who, by any device, subterfuge, or pretense
21 whatsoever, engages in or continues any of the kinds of business or
22 enterprise permitted to licensees by the Nebraska Installment Loan and
23 Sales Act without having obtained the license required by the act, with

25 misdemeanor.
26 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary,
27 any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the obligation
28 of any contract.
29 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
30 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
31 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
-127-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
2 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
3 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
4 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
5 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
6 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
7 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
8 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
9 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
10 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
11 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
12 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
13 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
14 date judgment is obtained.
15 Sec. 64. Section 45-343, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 45-343 A licensee may move its main office or may relocate a branch
18 office from one location to another without obtaining a new license if
19 the licensee gives notice thereof to the director through the Nationwide
20 Mortgage Licensing System and Registry at least thirty days prior to such
21 move and pays a filing fee of one hundred fifty dollars. The director
22 may, at the director's discretion, hold a hearing on the relocation
23 request, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The expense
24 of any such hearing shall be paid by the licensee.
25 Any person who violates any provision of the Nebraska Installment
26 Sales Act or acts as a sales finance company in this state without a
27 license therefor as provided in the Nebraska Installment Sales Act shall
28 be guilty of a Class II misdemeanor.
29 Sec. 65. Section 45-344, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 45-344 (1) No person acting personally or as an agent shall acquire
-128-

5 under subsection (2) of section 94 of this act.
6 (2) The director, upon receipt of such notice, shall approve or deny
7 the acquisition within thirty days.

12 in the director's judgment, any material information submitted is
13 substantially inaccurate or the acquiring party has not furnished all the
14 information required by the department.
15 (4) An acquisition may become effective prior to the expiration of
16 the thirty-day period if the director issues written notice of the
17 director's approval of such acquisition or the director's intent not to
18 deny the acquisition.
19 (5)(a) The director may deny any proposed acquisition if:
20 (i) The financial condition of any acquiring person is such as might
21 jeopardize the financial stability of the acquired licensee;
22 (ii) The character and general fitness of any acquiring person or of
23 any of the proposed management personnel indicate that the acquired
24 installment sales licensee or installment loan licensee would not be
25 operated honestly, fairly, or efficiently within the purposes of the
26 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act; or
27 (iii) Any acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish
28 all information required by the department.
29 (b) The director shall notify the acquiring party in writing of
30 denial of the acquisition. The notice shall provide a statement of the
31 basis for the denial.
-129-

2 denial, the acquiring party may make a written request for a hearing on
3 the proposed acquisition in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
4 Act and rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the department
5 under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. The director shall, by
6 order, approve or deny the proposed acquisition on the basis of the

9 of an installment contract, shall, directly or indirectly, contract for,
10 take, or receive charges in excess of those authorized by the Nebraska
11 Installment Sales Act except as a result of an accidental and bona fide
12 error such contract shall be void and uncollectible as to (1) all of the
13 excessive portion of the time-price differential, (2) the first one
14 thousand dollars of the time-price differential authorized by section
15 45-338, and (3) the first four thousand dollars of the principal of the
16 contract. If any seller or sales finance company violates any provision
17 of the act, other than the violations described above, except as a result
18 of an accidental and bona fide error, such installment contract shall be
19 void and uncollectible as to the first five hundred dollars of the time-
20 price differential and the first one thousand dollars of the principal of
21 such contract. If any of such money has been paid by the buyer, such
22 buyer or his or her assignee may recover under the act in a civil suit
23 brought within one year after the due date, or any extension thereof, of
24 the last installment of the contract.
25 Sec. 66. Section 45-345, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 45-345 (1) A licensee shall notify the director through the

6 resident, or the unauthorized access to or use of such information about
7 a Nebraska resident as a result of the breach.
8 (b) If a licensee would be required under Nebraska law to provide

10 licensee shall provide a copy of such notification to the department
11 prior to or simultaneously with the licensee's notification to the
12 Nebraska resident.
13 (c) Notice required by this subsection may be delayed if a law
14 enforcement agency determines that the notice will impede a criminal
15 investigation. Notice shall be made in good faith, without unreasonable
16 delay, and as soon as possible after the law enforcement agency

18 (d) For purposes of this subsection, the terms breach of the
19 security of the system and personal information have the same meaning as
20 in section 87-802.
21 (3) A licensee shall maintain the minimum net worth required by
22 section 45-337 while a license issued to the licensee under the Nebraska
23 Installment Loan and Sales Act is in effect. The minimum net worth shall
24 be proven by an annual audit conducted by a certified public accountant.
25 A licensee shall submit a copy of the annual audit to the director as
26 required by section 45-337 or upon written request of the director. If a
27 licensee fails to maintain the required minimum net worth, the department
28 may issue a notice of cancellation of the license in lieu of revocation
29 proceedings.
30 (4)(a) Every licensee shall, at the time any loan is made, give to

2 distinct terms the information required to be disclosed under the federal
3 Consumer Credit Protection Act.
4 (b) The licensee shall also give to the borrower a copy of any
5 writing evidencing a loan if the writing requires or provides for the

8 form and content substantially as follows:
9 NOTICE TO CONSUMER: 1. Do not sign this paper before you read it. 2.
10 You are entitled to a copy of this paper. 3. You may prepay the unpaid

13 (5) All licensees under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act
14 shall, on or before March 1 of each year, file with the department a
15 report of the licensee's earnings and operations for the preceding
16 calendar year, the licensee's assets at the end of the year, and any
17 other relevant information as the department may reasonably require. The
18 report shall be made under oath and shall be in the form and manner
19 prescribed by the department.

24 written statement of the dates and amounts of payments made and the
25 amounts of any default and deferment charges assessed preceding the month
26 in which the request is received and the total amount unpaid as of the
27 end of the period covered by the statement and a copy of the loan
28 agreement and security agreement, and a facsimile of any insurance
29 certificate issued as part of the transaction, if applicable. The
30 licensee may charge a reasonable fee for such copies, not to exceed fifty
31 cents per page.
-132-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (8) A licensee shall answer in writing, within ten business days
2 after receipt, any written request for payoff information from a borrower
3 or a borrower's representative. This service shall be provided without
4 charge to the borrower, except that when such information is provided
5 upon request within sixty days after the fulfillment of a previous
6 request, a processing fee of up to ten dollars may be charged for the
7 subsequent request.
8 (1) No person shall act as a sales finance company in this state
9 without obtaining a license therefor from the department as provided in
10 the Nebraska Installment Sales Act whether or not such person maintains
11 an office, place of doing business, or agent in this state, unless such
12 person meets the requirements of section 45-340.
13 (2) No financial institution or installment loan licensee authorized
14 to do business in this state shall be required to obtain a license under
15 the act but shall comply with all of the other provisions of the act.
16 (3) A seller who does not otherwise act as a sales finance company
17 shall not be required to obtain a license under the act but shall comply

19 price differential allowed by section 45-338.
20 Sec. 67. Section 45-346, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
21 2024, is amended to read:
22 45-346 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of
23 inspecting the business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage
24 in business activities requiring a license under the Nebraska Installment
25 Loan and Sales Act. The department may examine or investigate complaints
26 about or reports of alleged violations by a licensee made to the
27 department. The director shall have the power to appoint examiners who
28 shall, under the director's direction, investigate the installment sales
29 contracts, installment loans, and business and examine the books and
30 records of licensees when the director shall so determine. Such
31 examinations shall be conducted as often as determined by the director.
-133-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (2) The director or the director's duly authorized representative
2 shall have the power to make such investigations as the director or
3 authorized representative shall deem necessary, and to the extent
4 necessary for this purpose, the director or authorized representative may
5 examine a licensee or any other person and shall have the power to compel
6 the production of all relevant books, records, accounts, and documents.
7 (3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the
8 books and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set
9 forth in sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of
10 an investigation of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs
11 shall be paid within thirty days after receipt of billing.
12 (4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or
13 inquiry request for information from the department, the licensee shall
14 respond within twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to
15 respond as required by this subsection shall constitute a separate
16 violation.
17 (5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing
18 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has
19 willfully and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska
20 Installment Loan and Sales Act, any rule or regulation adopted and
21 promulgated under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, or any
22 order issued by the director under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
23 Sales Act, the director may order such person to pay (a) an
24 administrative fine of not more than five thousand dollars for each
25 separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation. The department
26 shall remit fines collected under this subsection to the State Treasurer
27 for distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the
28 Constitution of Nebraska.
29 (6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
30 investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien
31 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
-134-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil
2 action by the director. The lien shall attach to the real property of
3 such person when notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real
4 property in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
5 real property is located. The lien shall attach to any other property of
6 such person when notice of the lien is filed against the property in the
7 manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and
8 costs shall constitute a separate violation of the Nebraska Installment
9 Loan and Sales Act.
10 (1) A license issued under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act is
11 nontransferable and nonassignable. The same person may obtain additional
12 licenses for each place of business operating as a sales finance company
13 in this state upon compliance with the act as to each license, except
14 that on or after January 1, 2020, a person is no longer required to
15 obtain a new license for each place of business and may maintain a branch
16 office or offices upon compliance with the act.
17 (2) Application for a license shall be on a form prescribed and
18 furnished by the director and shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
19 the applicant's name and any trade name or doing business as designation
20 which the applicant intends to use in this state, (b) the applicant's
21 main office address, (c) all branch office addresses at which business is
22 to be conducted, (d) the names and titles of each director and principal
23 officer of the applicant, (e) the names of all shareholders, partners, or
24 members of the applicant, (f) a description of the activities of the
25 applicant in such detail as the department may require, (g) if the
26 applicant is an individual, his or her social security number, (h)
27 audited financial statements showing a minimum net worth of one hundred
28 thousand dollars, and (i) background checks as provided in section
29 45-354.
30 (3) An applicant for a license shall file with the department a
31 surety bond in the amount of fifty thousand dollars, furnished by a
-135-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 surety company authorized to do business in this state. Such bond shall
2 be increased by an additional fifty thousand dollars for each branch
3 location of the applicant that is licensed under the Nebraska Installment
4 Sales Act. The bond shall be for the use of the State of Nebraska and any
5 Nebraska resident who may have claims or causes of action against the
6 applicant. The surety may cancel the bond only upon thirty days' written
7 notice to the director.
8 (4) A license fee of one hundred fifty dollars, and, if applicable,
9 a one-hundred-dollar fee for each branch office listed in the
10 application, and any processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of
11 section 45-354 shall be submitted along with each application.
12 (5) An initial license shall remain in full force and effect until
13 the next succeeding December 31. Each license shall remain in force until
14 revoked, suspended, canceled, expired, or surrendered.
15 (6) The director shall, after an application has been filed for a
16 license under the act, investigate the facts, and if he or she finds that
17 the experience, character, and general fitness of the applicant, of the
18 members thereof if the applicant is a corporation or association, and of
19 the officers and directors thereof if the applicant is a corporation, are
20 such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly,
21 fairly, and efficiently within the purpose of the act, the director shall
22 issue and deliver a license to the applicant to do business as a sales
23 finance company in accordance with the license and the act. The director
24 shall have the power to reject for cause any application for a license.
25 (7) The director shall, within his or her discretion, make an
26 examination and inspection concerning the propriety of the issuance of a
27 license to any applicant. The cost of such examination and inspection
28 shall be borne by the applicant.
29 (8) If an applicant for a license under the act does not complete
30 the license application and fails to respond to a notice or notices from
31 the department to correct the deficiency or deficiencies for a period of
-136-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 one hundred twenty days or more after the date the department sends the
2 initial notice to correct the deficiency or deficiencies, the department
3 may deem the application as abandoned and may issue a notice of
4 abandonment of the application to the applicant in lieu of proceedings to
5 deny the application.
6 Sec. 68. Section 45-347, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 45-347 The payment in money, credit, goods, or things in action, as
9 consideration for any sale or assignment of, or order for, the payment of
10 wages, salary, commission, or other compensation for services, whether
11 earned or to be earned, shall, for purposes of regulation under the
12 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, be deemed a loan secured by such
13 assignment, and the amount by which the assigned compensation exceeds the
14 amount of the consideration actually paid, shall, for the purposes of
15 regulation under the act, be deemed interest or charges upon the loan
16 from the date of payment to the date the compensation is payable. Such
17 transaction shall be governed by and be subject to the act.
18 All money collected under the authority of the Nebraska Installment
19 Sales Act shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the
20 Financial Institution Assessment Cash Fund.
21 Sec. 69. Section 45-348, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 45-348 Every installment loan licensee shall permit payment to be
24 made in advance in any amount equal to one or more full installments on
25 any loan contract at any time during regular business hours, but the
26 licensee may apply such payment first to all accrued charges in full up
27 to the date of such payment.
28 (1) An installment sales license may be renewed annually on or
29 before December 31 by paying to the director a fee of one hundred fifty
30 dollars, plus one hundred dollars for each branch office, if applicable,
31 and any processing fee allowed under subsection (2) of section 45-354 and
-137-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 by submitting such information as the director may require to indicate
2 any material change in the information contained in the original
3 application or succeeding renewal applications, including a copy of the
4 licensee's most recent annual audit.
5 (2) A licensee may voluntarily surrender a license at any time by
6 delivering to the director written notice of the surrender. The
7 department shall cancel the license following such surrender.
8 (3) If a licensee fails to renew its license and does not
9 voluntarily surrender the license pursuant to this section, the
10 department may issue a notice of expiration of the license to the
11 licensee in lieu of revocation proceedings.
12 Sec. 70. (1) Except as provided in section 45-350 and subsection
13 (6) of this section, every installment loan licensee may make loans and
14 may contract for and receive on such loans charges at a rate not
15 exceeding twenty-four percent per annum on that part of the unpaid
16 principal balance on any loan not in excess of one thousand dollars, and
17 twenty-one percent per annum on any remainder of such unpaid principal
18 balance. Except for loans secured by mobile homes, an installment loan
19 licensee may not make loans for a period in excess of one hundred forty-
20 five months if the amount of the loan is greater than three thousand
21 dollars but less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Unless otherwise
22 allowed for by law, charges on loans made under the Nebraska Installment
23 Loan and Sales Act shall not be paid, deducted, or received in advance.
24 The contracting for, charging of, or receiving of charges as provided for
25 in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed to be the payment,
26 deduction, or receipt of such charges in advance.
27 (2) When the loan contract requires repayment in substantially equal
28 and consecutive monthly installments of principal and charges combined,
29 the installment loan licensee may, at the time the loan is made,
30 precompute the charges at the agreed rate on scheduled unpaid principal
31 balances according to the terms of the contract and add such charges to
-138-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 the principal of the loan. Every payment may be applied to the combined
2 total of principal and precomputed charges until the contract is fully
3 paid. All payments made on account of any loan except for default and
4 deferment charges shall be deemed to be applied to the unpaid
5 installments in the order in which the unpaid installments are due. The
6 portion of the precomputed charges applicable to any particular month of
7 the contract, as originally scheduled or following a deferment, shall be
8 that proportion of such precomputed charges, excluding any adjustment
9 made for a first installment period of more than one month and any
10 adjustment made for deferment, which the balance of the contract
11 scheduled to be outstanding during such month bears to the sum of all
12 monthly balances originally scheduled to be outstanding by the contract.
13 This section shall not limit or restrict the manner of calculating
14 charges, whether by way of add-on, single annual rate, or otherwise, if
15 the rate of charges does not exceed what is permitted by this section.
16 Charges may be contracted for and earned at a single annual rate, except
17 that the total charges from such rate shall not be greater than the total
18 charges from the several rates otherwise applicable to the different
19 portions of the unpaid balance according to subsection (1) of this
20 section. All loan contracts made pursuant to this subsection are subject
21 to the following adjustments:
22 (a) Notwithstanding the requirement for substantially equal and
23 consecutive monthly installments, the first installment period may not
24 exceed one month by more than twenty-one days and may not fall short of
25 one month by more than eleven days. The charges for each day exceeding
26 one month shall be one-thirtieth of the charges which would be applicable
27 to a first installment period of one month. The charge for extra days in
28 the first installment period may be added to the first installment and
29 such charges for such extra days shall be excluded in computing any
30 rebate;
31 (b) If prepayment in full by cash, a new loan, or otherwise occurs
-139-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 before the first installment due date, the charges shall be recomputed at
2 the rate of charges contracted for in accordance with this section upon
3 the actual unpaid principal balance of the loan for the actual time
4 outstanding by applying the payment, or payments, first to charges at the
5 agreed rate and the remainder to the principal. The amount of charges so
6 computed shall be retained in lieu of all precomputed charges;
7 (c) If a contract is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
8 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
9 receive a rebate of an amount which is not less than the amount obtained
10 by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally scheduled or,
11 if deferred, as deferred, for the period following prepayment, according
12 to the actuarial method, the rate of charge contracted for in accordance
13 with this section. The licensee may round the rate of charge to the
14 nearest one-half of one percent if such procedure is not consistently
15 used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any
16 default and deferment charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted
17 from any rebate. No rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment.
18 No rebate of less than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the
19 maturity of the contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If
20 judgment is obtained before the final installment date, the contract
21 balance shall be reduced by the rebate which would be required for
22 prepayment in full as of the date judgment is obtained;
23 (d) If any installment on a precomputed or interest-bearing loan is
24 unpaid in full for ten or more consecutive days, Sundays and holidays
25 included, after it is due, the licensee may charge and collect a default
26 charge not exceeding an amount equal to five percent of such installment.
27 If any installment payment is made by a check, draft, or similar signed
28 order which is not honored because of insufficient funds, no account, or
29 any other reason except an error of a third party to the loan contract,
30 the licensee may charge and collect a fifteen-dollar bad check charge.
31 Such default or bad check charges may be collected when due or at any
-140-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 time thereafter;
2 (e) If, as of an installment due date, the payment date of all
3 wholly unpaid installments is deferred one or more full months and the
4 maturity of the contract is extended for a corresponding period, the
5 licensee may charge and collect a deferment charge not exceeding the
6 charge applicable to the first of the installments deferred, multiplied
7 by the number of months in the deferment period. The deferment period is
8 that period during which no payment is made or required by reason of such
9 deferment. The deferment charge may be collected at the time of deferment
10 or at any time thereafter. The portion of the precomputed charges
11 applicable to each deferred balance and installment period following the
12 deferment period shall remain the same as that applicable to such balance
13 and periods under the original loan contract. No installment on which a
14 default charge has been collected, or on account of which any partial
15 payment has been made, shall be deferred or included in the computation
16 of the deferment charge unless such default charge or partial payment is
17 refunded to the borrower or credited to the deferment charge. Any payment
18 received at the time of deferment may be applied first to the deferment
19 charge and the remainder, if any, applied to the unpaid balance of the
20 contract, except that if such payment is sufficient to pay, in addition
21 to the appropriate deferment charge, any installment which is in default
22 and the applicable default charge, it shall be first so applied and any
23 such installment shall not be deferred or subject to the deferment
24 charge. If a loan is prepaid in full during the deferment period, the
25 borrower shall receive, in addition to the required rebate, a rebate of
26 that portion of the deferment charge applicable to any unexpired full
27 month or months of such deferment period; and
28 (f) If two or more full installments are in default for one full
29 month or more at any installment date and if the contract so provides,
30 the installment loan licensee may reduce the contract balance by the
31 rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of such
-141-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 installment date and the amount remaining unpaid shall be deemed to be
2 the unpaid principal balance and thereafter in lieu of charging,
3 collecting, receiving, and applying charges as provided in this
4 subsection, charges may be charged, collected, received, and applied at
5 the agreed rate as otherwise provided by this section until the loan is
6 fully paid.
7 (3) The charges, as referred to in subsection (1) of this section,
8 shall not be compounded. The charging, collecting, and receiving of
9 charges as provided in subsection (2) of this section shall not be deemed
10 compounding. If part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is
11 the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount
12 payable under such loan contract may include any unpaid charges on the
13 prior loan which have accrued within sixty days before the making of such
14 loan contract and may include the balance remaining after giving the
15 rebate required by subsection (2) of this section. Except as provided in
16 subsection (2) of this section, charges shall (a) be computed and paid
17 only as a percentage per month of the unpaid principal balance or
18 portions thereof and (b) be computed on the basis of the number of days
19 actually elapsed. For purposes of computing charges, whether at the
20 maximum rate or less, a month shall be that period of time from any date
21 in a month to the corresponding date in the next month but if there is no
22 such corresponding date then to the last day of the next month, and a day
23 shall be considered one-thirtieth of a month when computation is made for
24 a fraction of a month.
25 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section,
26 in addition to that provided for under the Nebraska Installment Loan and
27 Sales Act, no further or other amount whatsoever shall be directly or
28 indirectly charged, contracted for, or received. If any amount, in excess
29 of the charges permitted, is charged, contracted for, or received, the
30 loan contract shall not on that account be void, but the installment loan
31 licensee shall have no right to collect or receive any interest or other
-142-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 charges whatsoever. If such interest or other charges have been collected
2 or contracted for, the licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest
3 and other charges collected and shall not collect any interest or other
4 charges contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as
5 liquidated damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if
6 found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto,
7 including reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall
8 be found liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of
9 the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a
10 bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
11 adopted to avoid any such error.
12 (5) A borrower may be required to pay all reasonable expenses
13 incurred in connection with the making, closing, disbursing, extending,
14 readjusting, or renewing of loans. Such expenses may include abstracting,
15 recording, releasing, and registration fees; premiums paid for nonfiling
16 insurance; premiums paid on insurance policies covering tangible personal
17 property securing the loan; amounts charged for a debt cancellation
18 contract or a debt suspension contract, as agreed upon by the parties, if
19 the debt cancellation contract or debt suspension contract is a contract
20 of a financial institution or installment loan licensee and such contract
21 is sold directly by such financial institution or licensee or by an
22 unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent of such financial institution or
23 licensee in accordance with 12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part existed on
24 January 1, 2025, and the financial institution or installment loan
25 licensee is responsible for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent's
26 compliance with such part; title examinations; credit reports; survey;
27 taxes or charges imposed upon or in connection with the making and
28 recording or releasing of any mortgage; amounts charged for a guaranteed
29 asset protection waiver; and fees and expenses charged for electronic
30 title and lien services. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this
31 section, a borrower may also be required to pay a nonrefundable loan
-143-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 origination fee not to exceed the lesser of five hundred dollars or an
2 amount equal to seven percent of that part of the original principal
3 balance of any loan not in excess of two thousand dollars and five
4 percent on that part of the original principal balance in excess of two
5 thousand dollars, if the installment loan licensee has not made another
6 loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months. If the licensee
7 has made another loan to the borrower within the previous twelve months,
8 a nonrefundable loan origination fee may only be charged on new funds
9 advanced on each successive loan. Such reasonable initial charges may be
10 collected from the borrower or included in the principal balance of the
11 loan at the time the loan is made and shall not be considered interest or
12 a charge for the use of the money loaned.
13 (6)(a) Loans secured solely by real property that are not made
14 pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property shall
15 not be subject to the limitations on the rate of interest provided in
16 subsection (1) of this section or the limitations on the nonrefundable
17 loan origination fee under subsection (5) of this section if (i) the
18 principal amount of the loan is seven thousand five hundred dollars or
19 more and (ii) the sum of the principal amount of the loan and the
20 balances of all other liens against the property do not exceed one
21 hundred percent of the appraised value of the property. Acceptable
22 methods of determining appraised value shall be made by the department
23 pursuant to rule, regulation, or order.
24 (b) An origination fee on such loan shall be computed only on the
25 principal amount of the loan reduced by any portion of the principal that
26 consists of the amount required to pay off another loan made under this
27 subsection by the same licensee.
28 (c) A prepayment penalty on such loan shall be permitted only if (i)
29 the maximum amount of the penalty to be assessed is stated in writing at
30 the time the loan is made, (ii) the loan is prepaid in full within two
31 years from the date of the loan, and (iii) the loan is prepaid with money
-144-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 other than the proceeds of another loan made by the same licensee. Such
2 prepayment penalty shall not exceed six months' interest on eighty
3 percent of the original principal balance computed at the agreed rate of
4 interest on the loan.
5 (d) An installment loan licensee making a loan pursuant to this
6 subsection may obtain an interest in any fixtures attached to such real
7 property and any insurance proceeds payable in connection with such real
8 property or the loan.
9 (e) For purposes of this subsection, principal amount of the loan
10 means the total sum owed by the borrower including, but not limited to,
11 insurance premiums, loan origination fees, or any other amount that is
12 financed, except that for purposes of subdivision (6)(b) of this section,
13 loan origination fees shall not be included in calculating the principal
14 amount of the loan.
15 Sec. 71. Section 45-350, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 45-350 (1) Installment loan licensees may charge, contract for, or
18 receive any amount or rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.03 or
19 45-101.04 or section 70 of this act upon any loan or upon any part or all
20 of any aggregate indebtedness of the same person. Except as provided in
21 subsection (2) of this section, the charging, contracting for, or
22 receiving of a rate of interest permitted by section 45-101.04 does not
23 exempt the licensee from compliance with the Nebraska Installment Loan
24 and Sales Act.
25 (2)(a) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
26 subdivision (4) of section 45-101.04 are not subject to the Nebraska
27 Installment Loan and Sales Act if such loans are not made on real
28 property.
29 (b) Loans made by an installment loan licensee pursuant to
30 subdivision (11) of section 45-101.04 on real property are not subject to
31 the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. An installment loan licensee
-145-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 making such loans shall comply with and be subject to the Residential
2 Mortgage Licensing Act with respect to such loans, except that the
3 installment loan licensee shall not be required to obtain a mortgage
4 banker license under the Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
5 (c) Any mortgage loan originator who works as an employee or
6 independent agent of an installment loan licensee shall be required to
7 obtain a mortgage loan originator license and shall be subject to the
8 Residential Mortgage Licensing Act.
9 (3) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(a) of section 70 of this
10 act, no installment loan licensee shall enter into any loan contract
11 under the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act under which the
12 borrower agrees to make any payment of principal more than thirty-six
13 calendar months from the date of making such contract when the principal
14 balance is not more than three thousand dollars. Every loan contract
15 precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 70 of this act shall
16 provide for repayment of principal and charges in installments which
17 shall be payable at approximately equal periodic intervals of time and so
18 arranged that no installment is substantially greater in amount than any
19 preceding installment. When necessary in order to facilitate payment in
20 accordance with the borrower's principal source of income or when the
21 loan contract is not precomputed pursuant to subsection (2) of section 70
22 of this act, the payment schedule may reduce or omit installment
23 payments. Any loan contract made in violation of this section, either
24 knowingly or without the exercise of due care to prevent the violation,
25 shall not on that account be void, but the licensee has no right to
26 collect or receive any interest or charges on such loan. If any interest
27 or other charges have been collected or contracted for, the installment
28 loan licensee shall refund to the borrower all interest and other charges
29 collected and shall not collect thereafter any interest or other charges
30 contracted for and thereafter due on the loan involved, as liquidated
31 damages, and the installment loan licensee or its assignee, if found
-146-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating thereto, including
2 reasonable attorney's fees. No installment loan licensee shall be found
3 liable under this subsection if it shows by a preponderance of the
4 evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
5 fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
6 adopted to avoid any such error.
7 (1) Renewal of a license originally granted under the Nebraska
8 Installment Sales Act may be denied or a license may be suspended or
9 revoked by the director on the following grounds: (a) Material
10 misstatement in the application for license; (b) willful failure to
11 comply with any provision of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act relating
12 to installment contracts; (c) defrauding any buyer to the buyer's damage;
13 or (d) fraudulent misrepresentation, circumvention, or concealment by the
14 licensee through whatever subterfuge or device of any of the material
15 particulars or the nature thereof required to be stated or furnished to
16 the buyer under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
17 (2) If a licensee is a partnership, limited liability company,
18 association, or corporation, it shall be sufficient cause for the
19 suspension or revocation of a license that any officer, director, or
20 trustee of a licensed association or corporation or any member of a
21 licensed partnership or limited liability company has so acted or failed
22 to act as would be cause for suspending or revoking a license to such
23 party as an individual.
24 (3) No license shall be denied, suspended, or revoked except after
25 hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The director
26 shall give the licensee at least ten days' written notice, in the form of
27 an order to show cause, of the time and place of such hearing by either
28 registered or certified mail addressed to the principal place of business
29 in this state of such licensee. Such notice shall contain the grounds of
30 complaint against the licensee. Any order suspending or revoking such
31 license shall recite the grounds upon which the same is based. The order
-147-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 shall be entered upon the records of the director and shall not be
2 effective until after thirty days' written notice thereof given after
3 such entry forwarded by either registered or certified mail to the
4 licensee at such principal place of business.
5 (4) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
6 of any license shall not impair or affect the obligation of any lawful
7 installment contract acquired previously thereto by the licensee.
8 (5) Revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or surrender
9 of any license shall not affect civil or criminal liability for acts
10 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
11 surrender or affect liability for any fines which may be levied against
12 the licensee or any of its officers, directors, shareholders, partners,
13 or members pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act for acts
14 committed before the revocation, suspension, cancellation, expiration, or
15 surrender.
16 (6) Any person, licensee, or applicant considering himself or
17 herself aggrieved by an order of the director entered under the
18 provisions of this section may appeal the order. The appeal shall be in
19 accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
20 Sec. 72. Section 45-351, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 45-351 (1) Except as otherwise provided by the Nebraska Installment
23 Loan and Sales Act or other law, an installment loan licensee shall not
24 contact any individual who is not living, residing, or present in the
25 household of the borrower regarding the borrower's obligation to pay a
26 debt, other than the borrower's spouse, the borrower's attorney, another
27 creditor, or a credit reporting agency.
28 (2) The borrower may waive the benefits of this section at any time
29 by giving consent if such consent is given at a time subsequent to the
30 date the debt arises.
31 (1) The department shall be charged with the duty of inspecting the
-148-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 business, records, and accounts of all persons who engage in the business
2 of a sales finance company subject to the Nebraska Installment Sales Act.
3 The director shall have the power to appoint examiners who shall, under
4 his or her direction, investigate the installment contracts and business
5 and examine the books and records of licensees when the director shall so
6 determine. Such examinations shall not be conducted more often than
7 annually except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
8 (2) The director or his or her duly authorized representative shall
9 have the power to make such investigations as he or she shall deem
10 necessary, and to the extent necessary for this purpose, he or she may
11 examine such licensee or any other person and shall have the power to
12 compel the production of all relevant books, records, accounts, and
13 documents.
14 (3) The expenses of the director incurred in the examination of the
15 books and records of licensees shall be charged to the licensees as set
16 forth in sections 8-605 and 8-606. The director may charge the costs of
17 an investigation of a nonlicensed person to such person, and such costs
18 shall be paid within thirty days after receipt of billing.
19 (4) Upon receipt by a licensee of a notice of investigation or
20 inquiry request for information from the department, the licensee shall
21 respond within twenty-one calendar days. Each day a licensee fails to
22 respond as required by this subsection shall constitute a separate
23 violation.
24 (5) If the director finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing
25 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has
26 willfully and intentionally violated any provision of the Nebraska
27 Installment Sales Act, any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated
28 under the act, or any order issued by the director under the act, the
29 director may order such person to pay (a) an administrative fine of not
30 more than one thousand dollars for each separate violation and (b) the
31 costs of investigation. The department shall remit fines collected under
-149-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 this subsection to the State Treasurer for distribution in accordance
2 with Article VII, section 5, of the Constitution of Nebraska.
3 (6) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
4 investigation ordered pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a lien
5 in the amount of such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and
6 property of such person in this state and may be recovered in a civil
7 action by the director. The lien shall attach to the real property of
8 such person when notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real
9 property in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
10 real property is located. The lien shall attach to any other property of
11 such person when notice of the lien is filed against the property in the
12 manner prescribed by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and
13 costs shall constitute a separate violation of the Nebraska Installment
14 Sales Act.
15 Sec. 73. Section 45-352, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 45-352 (1) Section 45-351 shall not prohibit the licensee from:
18 (a) Contacting any person in order to discover property belonging to
19 the borrower that may be seized to satisfy a debt that has been reduced
20 to judgment;
21 (b) Making amicable demand and filing suit on the debt; or
22 (c) Contacting persons related to the borrower if permission is
23 specifically given in writing at the time the debt arises or at any time
24 after such debt arises.
25 (2) An installment loan licensee may contact any person without the
26 borrower's consent:
27 (a) To ascertain information relating to a borrower's credit
28 worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general
29 reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or
30 expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of
31 serving as a factor in establishing the borrower's eligibility for credit
-150-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 or insurance if such contacts are not designed to collect a delinquent
2 debt; or
3 (b) To locate the borrower when the licensee has reason to believe
4 the borrower has changed his or her employment or has moved from his or
5 her last-known address.
6 The director shall have the power to make such general rules and
7 regulations and specific rulings, demands, and findings as may be
8 necessary for the proper conduct of the business licensed under the
9 Nebraska Installment Sales Act, and the enforcement of the act, in
10 addition thereto and not inconsistent therewith.
11 Sec. 74. Section 45-353, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 45-353 (1) An agreement of the parties to a loan, with respect to
14 default on the part of the borrower, is enforceable only to the extent
15 that:
16 (a) The borrower fails to make a payment on the loan or other
17 charges required by the agreement; or
18 (b) The prospect of payment, performance, or realization of
19 collateral is significantly impaired. The burden of establishing the
20 prospect of significant impairment is on the installment loan licensee.
21 (2) If the borrower has defaulted on his or her promise to pay and
22 if he or she has given specific notice in writing, by registered or
23 certified mail, instructing the licensee to cease further contacts with
24 the borrower in regard to the indebtedness, the installment loan licensee
25 shall, after such notice, except as provided in section 45-352, limit
26 contacts to one notice per month by mail. No notice shall be designed to
27 threaten action not otherwise permitted by law.
28 (3) With respect to a loan, after a borrower has been in default for
29 ten days for failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
30 licensee may give the borrower the notice described in this section. An
31 installment loan licensee gives notice to the borrower under this section
-151-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 when it delivers the notice to the borrower or delivers or mails the
2 notice to the last-known address of the borrower's residence.
3 (4) The notice shall be in writing and shall conspicuously state:
4 (a) The name, address, and telephone number of the installment loan
5 licensee to which payment is to be made;
6 (b) A brief identification of the loan;
7 (c) The borrower's right to cure the default;
8 (d) The amount of payment and date by which payment must be made to
9 cure the default; and
10 (e) That any credit insurance issued in connection with the loan
11 contract may be canceled unless the borrower cures the default.
12 (5) With respect to a loan, after a default consisting only of the
13 borrower's failure to make a required payment, an installment loan
14 licensee may neither accelerate maturity of the unpaid balance of the
15 obligation nor take possession of collateral, except voluntarily
16 surrendered collateral, because of such default until twenty days after a
17 notice of the borrower's right to cure is given. The borrower shall have
18 twenty days after the notice is given to cure any default consisting of a
19 failure to make the required payment by tendering the amount of all
20 unpaid sums due at the time of the tender, without acceleration, plus any
21 unpaid charges. Cure restores the borrower to his or her rights under the
22 agreement as though the default had not occurred.
23 (6) With respect to defaults on the same obligation after an
24 installment loan licensee has once given a notice of the borrower's right
25 to cure, the borrower shall have no further right to cure and the
26 installment loan licensee has no obligation to proceed against the
27 borrower or the collateral.
28 (7) Upon default by a borrower with respect to a loan, unless the
29 borrower voluntarily surrenders possession of the collateral to the
30 licensee, the licensee may take possession of the collateral without
31 judicial process only if possession can be taken without entry into a
-152-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 dwelling or a locked, unoccupied motor vehicle, and without the use of
2 force or other breach of the peace.
3 (1) Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any
4 person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate any of the
5 provisions of the Nebraska Installment Sales Act, he or she may, in
6 addition to all actions provided for in the act and without prejudice
7 thereto, enter an order requiring such person to desist or to refrain
8 from such violation. An action may also be brought, on the relation of
9 the Attorney General or the director, to enjoin such person from engaging
10 in or continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in
11 furtherance thereof.
12 (2) In any such action an order or judgment may be entered awarding
13 such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In addition
14 to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining
15 order or injunction, the court, in which such action is brought, shall
16 have power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the
17 property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
18 documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court
19 may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska
20 Installment Sales Act through or by means of the use of such property and
21 business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, shall have such
22 powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up
23 and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from time to
24 time, be conferred upon him or her by the court.
25 Sec. 75. Section 45-354, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
26 2024, is amended to read:
27 45-354 (1) A borrower is not liable for a deficiency unless the
28 licensee has disposed of the collateral in good faith and in a
29 commercially reasonable manner.
30 (2) If the installment loan licensee takes possession or voluntarily
31 accepts surrender of goods in which the licensee has a security interest
-153-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 to secure a loan and at the time thereof the unpaid balance due on the
2 loan is three thousand dollars or less, the borrower is not personally
3 liable to the installment loan licensee for the unpaid balance of the
4 debt arising from the loan and the licensee's duty to dispose of the
5 collateral is governed by the provisions on disposition of collateral,
6 article 9, Uniform Commercial Code.
7 (3) The borrower may be liable in damages to the installment loan
8 licensee if the borrower has wrongfully damaged the collateral or if,
9 after default, failure to cure, and demand, the borrower has wrongfully
10 failed to make the collateral available to the installment loan licensee.
11 (4) If the installment loan licensee elects to bring an action
12 against the borrower for a debt arising from a loan, when under this
13 section the installment loan licensee would not be entitled to a
14 deficiency judgment if the installment loan licensee took possession of
15 the collateral, and obtains judgment, (a) the installment loan licensee
16 may not take possession of the collateral and (b) the collateral is not
17 subject to levy or sale on execution or similar proceedings pursuant to
18 the judgment.
19 (1) Effective January 1, 2013, or within one hundred eighty days
20 after the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry is capable of
21 accepting licenses issued under the Nebraska Installment Sales Act,
22 whichever is later, the department shall require such licensees under the
23 act to be licensed and registered through the Nationwide Mortgage
24 Licensing System and Registry. In order to carry out this requirement,
25 the department is authorized to participate in the Nationwide Mortgage
26 Licensing System and Registry. For this purpose, the department may
27 establish, by adopting and promulgating rules and regulations or by
28 order, requirements as necessary. The requirements may include, but not

21 contracts with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry or
22 other entities designated by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and
23 Registry to collect and maintain records and process transaction fees or
24 other fees related to licensees or other persons subject to the act. The

27 services of the system directly from each licensee or applicant for a
28 license.

7 of security of the system notification policy. The director shall make
8 available upon written request a copy of the contract between the
9 department and the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry
10 pertaining to the breach of security of the system provisions.
11 (6) The department shall upon written request provide the most
12 recently available audited financial report of the Nationwide Mortgage
13 Licensing System and Registry.
14 (7) The director may use the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System
15 and Registry as a channeling agent for requesting information from and
16 distributing information to the United States Department of Justice or
17 any other governmental agency in order to reduce the points of contact
18 which the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have to maintain for
19 purposes of subsection (1) of this section.
20 Sec. 76. Section 45-355, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

13 disclosed to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. Such
14 information and material may be shared with all federal and state
15 regulatory officials with mortgage industry oversight authority without
16 the loss of privilege or the loss of confidentiality protections provided
17 by federal or state law;
18 (b) Information or material that is subject to privilege or

29 discretion of such person, that privilege;
30 (c) Any state statute relating to the disclosure of confidential
31 supervisory information or any information or material described in

-160-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 required as a condition precedent to the making of such loan; and
2 (e) Life, health, and accident insurance or any of them, except that
3 the amount of such insurance shall not exceed the total amount to be
4 repaid under the loan contract and the term shall not extend beyond the
5 final maturity date of the loan contract. In the event of a renewal of a
6 loan contract, this type of insurance shall be canceled and a refund of
7 the unearned premium credited or made before new insurance of this type
8 may be written in connection with such loan. Such insurance shall not be
9 required as a condition precedent to the making of such loan.
10 (2) In addition to the types of insurance written under subsection
11 (1) of this section by licensees under the act, any other type of
12 insurance or motor club service as defined in section 44-3707 may be
13 provided for the benefit of a licensee's borrower or the borrower's
14 immediate family whether or not in connection with a loan, except that
15 such insurance or motor club service shall not be required as a condition
16 precedent to the making of any loan. Nothing in this subsection alters or
17 eliminates any insurance licensing requirements or certificate of
18 authority requirements under the Motor Club Services Act.
19 (3) Notwithstanding section 70 of this act and section 45-350, any
20 gain or advantage, in the form of commission or otherwise, to the
21 licensee or to any employee, affiliate, or associate of the licensee from
22 such insurance or motor club service or the sale thereof shall not be
23 deemed to be an additional or further charge in connection with the loan
24 contract. The insurance premium or motor club service contract fee may be
25 collected from the borrower or financed through the loan contract at the
26 time the loan is made.
27 (4)(a) Insurance permitted under this section shall be obtained
28 through a duly licensed insurance agent, agency, or broker. Premiums
29 shall not exceed those fixed by law or current applicable manual rates.

-161-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 of the licensee.
2 (b) Motor club services permitted under this section shall be
3 obtained through a motor club which holds a certificate of authority
4 under the Motor Club Services Act.
5 (5) In the event of a renewal of a loan contract, any insurance or
6 motor club service sold pursuant to this section shall be canceled and
7 (a) a refund of the unearned premium or motor club service contract fee
8 credited or made before new insurance or motor club service of the same
9 type as that being canceled may be rewritten or (b) the holder of the
10 loan contract shall send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days
11 after cancellation of the name, address, and telephone number of the
12 insurance company or motor club which issued the insurance contract or
13 motor club service contract or the party responsible for any refund and
14 notice that the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice
15 shall be retained by the holder of the loan contract.
16 (6) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this
17 section is canceled or the premium or motor club service contract fee
18 adjusted during the term of the loan contract, any refund of the
19 insurance premium or motor club service contract fee plus the unearned
20 interest thereon received by the holder shall be credited by the holder
21 to the loan contract or otherwise refunded, except to the extent applied
22 toward payment for similar insurance or motor club service protecting the
23 interests of the buyer and the holder or either of them.
24 (7) If any insurance or motor club service sold pursuant to this
25 section is canceled due to the payment of all sums for which the buyer is
26 liable under a loan contract, the holder of the loan contract shall, upon
27 receipt of payment of all sums due, send notice to the buyer within
28 fifteen business days after payment of the sums due of the name, address,
29 and telephone number of the insurance company or motor club which issued
30 the insurance contract or motor club service contract or the party
31 responsible for any refund and notice that the buyer may be eligible for
-162-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 a refund. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the holder of the
2 loan contract. This subsection does not apply if the holder of the loan
3 contract previously credited the refund of the insurance premium or motor
4 club service contract fee to the loan contract or otherwise refunded the
5 insurance premium or motor club service contract fee to the buyer.
6 (8) The licensee shall, at the time the loan is made, give to the
7 borrower, or if more than one, to one of them, a statement concerning any
8 insurance procured by or through the licensee, which includes the amount
9 of any premium which the borrower has paid or is obligated to pay, the
10 expiration date of the policy, and a concise description of the risks
11 insured. If a borrower procures insurance by or through a licensee, the
12 licensee shall deliver to the borrower within fifteen days after the
13 making of the loan an executed copy of the insurance policy or
14 certificate of insurance.
15 Sec. 81. (1) Licensees holding an active installment loan license
16 may make preauthorized loans. Preauthorized loan means a loan made by a
17 licensee pursuant to an agreement between the licensee and the borrower
18 whereby:
19 (a) The licensee may permit the borrower to obtain advances of money
20 from the licensee from time to time or the licensee may advance money on
21 behalf of the borrower from time to time as directed by the borrower;
22 (b) The amount of each advance and permitted charge and cost is
23 debited to the borrower's account and payments and other credits are
24 credited to the same account;
25 (c) The charges are computed on the unpaid principal balance or
26 balances of the account from time to time;
27 (d) The borrower has the privilege of paying the account in full at
28 any time or, if the account is not in default, in monthly installments or
29 fixed or determinable amounts as provided in the agreement; and
30 (e) The loan agreement expressly states that it covers preauthorized
31 loans. Preauthorized loan does not mean a transaction, resulting in
-163-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 either a credit or a debit to the borrower's account, which is initiated
2 by the use or application of a plastic, metal, or other type of credit or
3 transaction card.
4 (2) For purposes of computations relating to preauthorized loans
5 made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, billing
6 cycle means the time interval between periodic billing dates. A billing
7 cycle shall be considered monthly if the closing date of the cycle is the
8 same date each month or does not vary by more than four days from such
9 date.
10 Sec. 82. (1) A licensee may make preauthorized loans and may
11 contract for and receive charges on such loans as set forth in subsection
12 (1) of section 70 of this act, subject to the following requirements:
13 (a) A licensee shall not compound charges by adding any unpaid
14 charges authorized by section 70 of this act or this section to the
15 unpaid principal balance of the borrower's account, except that the
16 unpaid principal balance may include additional charges for credit life
17 insurance or credit disability insurance provided in connection with the
18 preauthorized loan, subject to the requirements and restrictions
19 contained in section 83 of this act;
20 (b) Charges authorized by section 70 of this act or this section
21 shall be deemed not to exceed the maximum charges permitted by such
22 sections if such charges are computed in each billing cycle by any of the
23 following methods:
24 (i) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
25 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the daily unpaid
26 principal balance of the account, in which case each daily rate is
27 determined by multiplying the authorized monthly rate by twelve and
28 dividing by three hundred sixty-five;
29 (ii) By multiplying each graduated monthly rate by the applicable
30 portion of the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in
31 the billing cycle, in which case the average daily unpaid principal
-164-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided
2 by the number of days in the cycle; or
3 (iii) By converting each graduated monthly rate to a daily rate and
4 multiplying such daily rate by the applicable portion of the average
5 daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in
6 which case each daily rate is determined by multiplying the authorized
7 monthly rate by twelve and dividing by three hundred sixty-five, and the
8 average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid
9 each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in the cycle; and
10 (c) For each method of computation set forth in this section, the
11 billing cycle shall be monthly and the unpaid principal balance on any
12 day shall be determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the
13 beginning of that day all advances and other permissible amounts charged
14 to the borrower and deducting all payments and other credits made or
15 received that day.
16 (2) The borrower under a preauthorized loan may at any time pay all
17 or any part of the unpaid balance in his or her account, or, if the
18 account is not in default, the borrower may pay the unpaid principal
19 balance in monthly installments. Minimum monthly payment requirements
20 shall be determined by the licensee and set forth in the preauthorized
21 loan agreement, except that the minimum monthly payment shall not be less
22 than one and one-half percent of the average daily unpaid principal
23 balance of an account having an average daily balance of more than three
24 thousand dollars nor less than two percent of the average daily unpaid
25 principal balance of an account having an average daily balance of three
26 thousand dollars or less.
27 (3) A licensee may retain any security interest, including a
28 mortgage on real property, until the preauthorized account is terminated.
29 (4) Subsection (4) of section 45-345, subsection (3) of section
30 45-350, and section 78 of this act shall not apply to preauthorized
31 loans.
-165-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (5) The department may approve record-keeping systems for licensees
2 and may prescribe policies and procedures necessary to the administration
3 of preauthorized loans made pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and
4 Sales Act.
5 Sec. 83. In addition to the charges permitted under section 82 of
6 this act, a licensee may contract for and receive the fees, costs, and
7 expenses permitted by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act on
8 other loans, subject to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in
9 the act with the following variations:
10 (1) If credit life or disability insurance is provided and if the
11 insured dies or becomes disabled when there is an outstanding
12 preauthorized loan indebtedness, the insurance shall be sufficient to pay
13 the total balance of the loan due on the date of the borrower's death or
14 the amount due as of the end of the previous billing cycle, whichever is
15 less, in the case of credit life insurance, or all minimum payments which
16 become due on the loan during the covered period of disability in the
17 case of credit disability insurance. The additional charge for credit
18 life insurance or credit disability insurance shall be calculated in each
19 billing cycle by applying the current monthly premium rate for such
20 insurance, as such rate may be determined by the Director of Insurance,
21 to the unpaid balances in the borrower's account, using either of the
22 methods specified in section 82 of this act for the calculation of loan
23 charges;
24 (2) No credit life or disability insurance written in connection
25 with a preauthorized loan shall be canceled by the licensee because of
26 delinquency of the borrower in the making of the required minimum
27 payments on the loan unless one or more of such payments is past due for
28 a period of ninety days or more, and the licensee shall advance to the
29 insurer the amounts required to keep the insurance in force during such
30 period, which amounts may be debited to the borrower's account;
31 (3) The department may, by rule and regulation or order, require a
-166-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 statement of insurance that will be appropriate for preauthorized loans
2 in lieu of that required by section 80 of this act; and
3 (4) The amount, terms, and conditions of any insurance against loss
4 or damage to property must be reasonable in relation to the character and
5 value of the property insured and the maximum anticipated amount of
6 credit to be extended.
7 Sec. 84. (1) For purposes of this section, reverse-mortgage loan
8 means a loan made by a licensee which (a) is secured by residential real
9 estate, (b) is nonrecourse to the borrower except in the event of fraud
10 by the borrower or waste to the residential real estate given as security
11 for the loan, (c) provides cash advances to the borrower based upon the
12 equity in the borrower's owner-occupied principal residence, (d) requires
13 no payment of principal or interest until the entire loan becomes due and
14 payable, and (e) otherwise complies with the terms of this section.
15 (2) Reverse-mortgage loans shall be governed by the following rules
16 without regard to the requirements set out elsewhere for other types of
17 mortgage transactions: (a) Payment in whole or in part is permitted
18 without penalty at any time during the period of the loan; (b) an advance
19 and interest on the advance have priority over a lien filed after the
20 closing of a reverse-mortgage loan; (c) an interest rate may be fixed or
21 adjustable and may also provide for interest that is contingent on
22 appreciation in the value of the residential real estate; and (d) the
23 advance shall not be reduced in amount or number based on an adjustment
24 in the interest rate when a reverse-mortgage loan provides for periodic
25 advances to a borrower.
26 (3) Reverse-mortgage loans may be made or acquired without regard to
27 the following provisions for other types of mortgage transactions: (a)
28 Limitations on the purpose and use of future advances or any other
29 mortgage proceeds; (b) limitations on future advances to a term of years
30 or limitations on the term of credit line advances; (c) limitations on
31 the term during which future advances take priority over intervening
-167-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 advances; (d) requirements that a maximum mortgage amount be stated in
2 the mortgage; (e) limitations on loan-to-value ratios; (f) prohibitions
3 on balloon payments; (g) prohibitions on compounded interest and interest
4 on interest; and (h) requirements that a percentage of the loan proceeds
5 must be advanced prior to loan assignment.

8 does not exceed two percent of the appraised value of the owner-occupied
9 principal residence at the time the loan is made, (b) a reasonable fee
10 paid to third parties originating loans on behalf of the licensee, and
11 (c) such other fees as are necessary and required, including fees for
12 inspections, insurance, appraisals, and surveys.
13 (5) Licensees failing to make loan advances as required in the loan
14 documents and failing to cure the default as required in the loan
15 documents shall forfeit an amount equal to the greater of two hundred
16 dollars or one percent of the amount of the loan advance the licensee
17 failed to make.
18 Sec. 85. (1) Each retail installment sales contract shall be in
19 writing, shall be signed by both the buyer and the seller, and shall
20 contain the following items, and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the
21 buyer at the time the instrument is signed, except for contracts made in
22 conformance with subdivision (5)(c) of section 45-336:

3 contract is sold directly by such financial institution or licensee or by
4 an unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent of such financial institution or
5 licensee in accordance with 12 C.F.R. part 37, as such part existed on

7 for the unaffiliated, nonexclusive agent's compliance with such part, and
8 a separate charge is made therefor;
9 (f) The amount included for electronic title and lien services other

28 stated in the sequence or order set forth in such subsection. Additional
29 items may be included to explain the computations made in determining the
30 amount to be paid by the buyer. No installment sales contract shall be

-169-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 spaces to be filled in after execution, except that if delivery of the
2 goods or services is not made at the time of the execution of the
3 contract, the identifying numbers or marks of the goods, or similar
4 information, and the due date of the first installment may be inserted in
5 the contract after its execution.
6 (4) If a seller proffers an installment sales contract as part of a
7 transaction which delays or cancels, or promises to delay or cancel, the
8 payment of the time-price differential on the contract if the buyer pays
9 the basic time price, cash price, or cash sale price within a certain
10 period of time, the seller shall, in clear and conspicuous writing,
11 either within the installment sales contract or in a separate document,
12 inform the buyer of the exact date by which the buyer must pay the basic
13 time price, cash price, or cash sale price in order to delay or cancel
14 the payment of the time-price differential. The seller or any subsequent
15 purchaser of the installment sales contract, including a sales finance
16 company, shall not be allowed to change such date.
17 (5) Upon written request from the buyer, the holder of an
18 installment sales contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written
19 statement of the dates and amounts of payments and the total amount
20 unpaid under such contract. A buyer shall be given a written receipt for
21 any payment when made in cash.
22 (6) After payment of all sums for which the buyer is obligated under
23 a contract, the holder shall deliver or mail to the buyer at his or her
24 last-known address one or more good and sufficient instruments or copies
25 thereof to acknowledge payment in full and shall release all security in
26 the goods and mark canceled and return to the buyer the original
27 agreement or copy thereof or instruments or copies thereof signed by the
28 buyer. For purposes of this section, a copy shall meet the requirements
29 of section 25-12,112.
30 Sec. 86. (1)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law,
31 the time-price differential for any goods or services sold under an
-170-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 installment sales contract shall be stated as a fixed or variable annual
2 percentage rate and shall be at a rate agreed to in writing, not to
3 exceed eighteen percent per annum, except that a minimum time-price
4 differential of ten dollars may be charged on any installment sales
5 contract.
6 (b) Origination fees may be required to be made by the buyer,
7 subject to the following requirements:
8 (i) A buyer may be required, upon the execution of the installment
9 sales contract, to pay an origination fee in an amount not to exceed ten
10 dollars, except that if the installment sales contract is for an
11 installment sale of agricultural machinery or equipment for use in
12 commercial agriculture or if the installment sales contract is for an
13 installment sale of industrial machinery or equipment, the buyer may be
14 required to pay (A) an origination fee of not to exceed one hundred
15 dollars if the cash sale price is less than twenty-five thousand dollars
16 or (B) an origination fee of not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars if
17 the cash sale price is twenty-five thousand dollars or more; and
18 (ii) The origination fee shall be refundable if the installment
19 sales contract is canceled during the first thirty days. The origination
20 fee may be collected from the buyer or included in the principal balance
21 of the installment sales contract at the time the contract is made and
22 shall not be considered interest or a time-price differential.
23 (c) Nothing in the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act prohibits
24 a seller or holder of an installment sales contract from contracting for,
25 computing, and charging a time-price differential based upon the
26 application of the rate charged to the unpaid principal balance for the
27 number of days actually elapsed. The charges so computed shall be used
28 for the purpose of calculating the time-price differential, the time-
29 price balance, the amount of each installment, and the time-sale price.
30 (d) When the installment sales contract is payable in substantially
31 equal and consecutive monthly installments, the time-price differential
-171-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 shall be computed on the basic time price of each contract, as determined
2 under section 85 of this act, from the date of the contract until the due
3 date of the final installment, notwithstanding that the time-price
4 balance is required to be paid in installments.
5 (2) When an installment sales contract provides for payment other
6 than in substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments, the
7 time-price differential may be at a rate which will provide the same
8 return as is permitted on substantially equal monthly payment contracts
9 under subdivision (1)(d) of this section, having due regard for the
10 schedule of payments.
11 (3) Every contract payable in two or more installments shall provide
12 for payment of such installments by stating the date and amount of each
13 installment or the method by which any variable rate or installment shall
14 be determined.
15 Sec. 87. (1) The amount, if any, included for insurance, which may
16 be purchased by the holder of the contract, shall not exceed the
17 applicable premium rates chargeable in accordance with filings, if any,
18 with the Department of Insurance. If dual interest insurance on the goods
19 is purchased by the holder, it shall, within thirty days after execution
20 of the installment sales contract, send or cause to be sent to the buyer
21 a policy or policies or certificate of insurance, written by an insurance
22 company authorized to do business in this state, clearly setting forth
23 the amount of the premium, the kind or kinds of insurance, the coverages,
24 and all the terms and conditions of the contract or contracts of
25 insurance.
26 (2) If any insurance is canceled or the premium adjusted during the
27 term of the installment sales contract, any refund of the insurance
28 premium plus the unearned time-price differential thereon received by the
29 holder shall be credited by the holder to the last maturing installment
30 of the contract except to the extent applied toward payment for similar
31 insurance protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder or either
-172-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 of them.
2 (3) If any insurance is canceled due to the payment of all sums for
3 which the buyer is liable under an installment sales contract, the holder
4 of the installment sales contract shall, upon receipt of payment of all
5 sums due, send notice to the buyer within fifteen business days of the
6 name, address, and telephone number of the insurance company which issued
7 the insurance contract or the party responsible for any refund, and
8 notice that the buyer may be eligible for a refund. A copy of such notice
9 shall be retained by the holder of the installment sales contract. This
10 subsection does not apply if the holder of the loan contract previously
11 credited the refund of the insurance premium to the loan contract or
12 otherwise refunded the insurance premium to the buyer.
13 (4) The holder may also purchase nonfiling insurance and charge a
14 reasonable fee. The fee shall not exceed the amount of fees and charges
15 prescribed by law which would have been paid to public officials for
16 filing, perfecting, releasing, and satisfying any lien or security
17 interest in the goods or services.
18 Sec. 88. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the
19 contrary, any buyer may prepay in full at any time before maturity the
20 obligation of any contract.
21 (2) If such obligation is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, or
22 otherwise after the first installment due date, the borrower shall
23 receive a rebate of an amount which shall be not less than the amount
24 obtained by applying to the unpaid principal balances as originally
25 scheduled or, if deferred, as deferred, for the period following
26 prepayment, according to the actuarial method, the rate of the time-price
27 differential previously stated to the borrower. The licensee may round
28 the rate of the time-price differential to the nearest one-half of one
29 percent if such procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater
30 yield than would otherwise be permitted. Any default and deferment
31 charges which are due and unpaid may be deducted from any rebate. No
-173-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 rebate shall be required for any partial prepayment. No rebate of less
2 than one dollar need be made. Acceleration of the maturity of the
3 contract shall not in itself require a rebate. If judgment is obtained
4 before the final installment date, the contract balance shall be reduced
5 by the rebate which would be required for prepayment in full as of the
6 date judgment is obtained.
7 Sec. 89. (1) Where a buyer makes any subsequent purchases of goods
8 or services from a seller from whom such buyer has previously purchased
9 goods or services under one or more installment sales contracts and the
10 amounts under such contract or contracts to the extent of cash sale price
11 thereof have not been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may be
12 included in and consolidated with one or more of the prior contract or
13 contracts. A memorandum of such additional purchases shall be prepared by
14 the seller and inserted in or attached to the seller's counterpart of the
15 contract and shall set forth:
16 (a) The names of the seller and the buyer and a description of the
17 additional goods or services sold and all the information with respect to
18 the additional purchase required by section 85 of this act to be included
19 in an installment sales contract;
20 (b) The consolidated time-price balance to be paid by the buyer; and
21 (c) The revised payments.
22 (2) A copy of such memorandum shall be delivered to the buyer as
23 provided in and subject to section 85 of this act. When such subsequent
24 purchases are made, the entire amount of all payments made prior to such
25 subsequent purchases shall be deemed to have been applied on previous
26 purchases.
27 (3) Each payment thereafter made on a consolidated installment sales
28 contract shall be deemed to be allocated to all of the various purchases
29 in the same ratio or proportion as the original cash sale prices of the
30 various purchases bear to one another. Where the amount of each deferred
31 payment is increased in connection with such subsequent purchase, the
-174-

2025 2025
1 subsequent payments, at the seller's option, may be deemed to be
2 allocated as follows: An amount equal to the original installment payment
3 to the previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The
4 amount of any initial payment or downpayment on the subsequent purchase
5 shall be allocated in its entirety to such subsequent purchase. This

14 five percent of each installment or twenty-five dollars, whichever is
15 less, or, in lieu thereof, interest after maturity on each such
16 installment not exceeding the highest permissible contract rate. If the
17 time-price differential is computed by application of the rate charged to
18 the unpaid principal balance for the number of days actually elapsed,
19 such delinquency charge may not exceed five percent of each installment
20 or twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. If any installment payment is
21 made by a check, draft, or similar signed order which is not honored
22 because of insufficient funds, no account, or any other reason except an
23 error of a third party to the contract, the holder may charge and collect
24 a fee of not more than fifteen dollars. The delinquency charge and such
25 fee may be collected when due or at any time thereafter.

10 originally agreed upon in the retail installment sales contract on the
11 outstanding balance.
12 Sec. 92. (1) If any seller or sales finance company, in the making
13 or collection of an installment sales contract, shall, directly or
14 indirectly, contract for, take, or receive charges in excess of those
15 authorized by the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act except as a
16 result of an accidental and bona fide error, such contract shall be void
17 and uncollectible as to (a) all of the excessive portion of the time-
18 price differential, (b) the first one thousand dollars of the time-price
19 differential authorized by section 86 of this act, and (c) the first four
20 thousand dollars of the principal of the contract.

30 contract.

11 that the other business is of such nature that the conducting of such
12 other business tends to conceal evasion of the act or of the rules and
13 regulations adopted and promulgated under the act. In such case, the
14 director shall order such licensee in writing to cease and desist from
15 such conduct.
16 (3) No licensee shall, directly or indirectly, require a borrower as

-182-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 the purposes of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act.
2 Sec. 96. Any person violating subsection (4) of section 45-345,
3 section 70 of this act, section 45-356, or section 80 of this act is
4 guilty of a Class II misdemeanor. If, in the making of, or collection on,
5 any loan contract, any act is done which constitutes a Class II
6 misdemeanor under this section, that loan shall not be void, but the
7 licensee shall have no right to collect or receive any interest or
8 charges whatsoever. If any interest or other charges have been collected,
9 the licensee shall forfeit and refund to the borrower all interest and
10 other charges collected on the loan involved and shall not collect
11 thereafter any interest or other charges contracted for and thereafter
12 due on the loan involved, as liquidated damages, and the licensee or its
13 assignee, if found liable, shall pay the costs of any action relating
14 thereto, including reasonable attorney's fees. No licensee shall be found
15 liable under this section if the licensee shows by a preponderance of the
16 evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona
17 fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably
18 adopted to avoid any such error.
19 Sec. 97. Any violation of section 93 of this act, in connection
20 with any loan transaction, however acquired, shall not render the
21 indebtedness, any interest, or other charges void or uncollectible. In an

23 licensee violating section 93 of this act an award of liquidated damages
24 in an amount determined by the court, but not less than five hundred
25 dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. In any legal action brought
26 pursuant to this section in which the licensee is found liable, the court
27 shall award costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the borrower. A
28 licensee is not liable under this section if the licensee notifies the
29 borrower of an error before the licensee receives from the borrower
30 written notice of the error or before the borrower has brought an action
31 under this section and the licensee corrects the error within thirty days
-183-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 after notifying the borrower. A licensee may not be held liable in any
2 action brought under this section if the licensee shows by a
3 preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and
4 resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of
5 procedures reasonably adopted to avoid the error.
6 Sec. 98. Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that
7 any person is violating or is threatening to or intends to violate the
8 Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act, the director may, in addition to
9 any action provided in the act and without prejudice thereto, enter an
10 order requiring such person to cease and desist or to refrain from such
11 violation. An action may also be brought, on the relation of the Attorney
12 General and the director, to enjoin such person from engaging in or
13 continuing such violation or from doing any act or acts in furtherance of
14 such violation. In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered
15 awarding such preliminary or final injunction as may be deemed proper. In
16 addition to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a
17 restraining order or injunction, the court, in which such action is
18 brought, has power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for
19 the property and business of the defendant, including books, papers,
20 documents, and records pertaining thereto or so much thereof as the court
21 may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the Nebraska
22 Installment Loan and Sales Act through or by means of the use of such
23 property and business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified,
24 has such powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration,
25 winding up, and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from
26 time to time, be conferred upon the receiver by the court.
27 Sec. 99. (1) The department may order any person to cease and
28 desist whenever the department determines that the person has violated
29 any provision of the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act. Upon entry
30 of a cease and desist order, the director shall promptly notify the
31 affected person that such order has been entered, of the reasons for such
-184-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 order, and that upon receipt, within fifteen business days after the date
2 of the order, of written request from the affected person a hearing will
3 be scheduled within thirty business days after the date of receipt of the
4 written request unless the parties consent to a later date or the hearing
5 officer sets a later date for good cause. If a hearing is not requested
6 and none is ordered by the director, the order shall remain in effect
7 until it is modified or vacated.
8 (2) The director may vacate or modify a cease and desist order if he
9 or she finds that the conditions which caused its entry have changed or
10 that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.
11 (3) A person aggrieved by a cease and desist order of the director
12 may obtain judicial review of the order in the manner prescribed in the
13 Administrative Procedure Act and the rules and regulations adopted and
14 promulgated by the department under the act. The director may obtain an
15 order from the district court of Lancaster County for the enforcement of
16 the cease and desist order.
17 (4) A person who violates a cease and desist order of the director
18 may, after notice and hearing and upon further order of the director, be
19 subject to a penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each act
20 in violation of the cease and desist order. The department shall remit
21 fines collected under this section to the State Treasurer for
22 distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the
23 Constitution of Nebraska.
24 Sec. 100. (1) The director may, following a hearing under the
25 Administrative Procedure Act, impose an administrative fine against any
26 officer, director, shareholder, partner, or member of a licensee, if the
27 director finds the licensee or any such person participated in or had
28 knowledge of any act prohibited by the Nebraska Installment Loan and
29 Sales Act or otherwise violated the act. Such administrative fine shall
30 be in addition to or separate from any fine imposed against a licensee
31 pursuant to section 45-346.
-185-

LB474 LB474
2025 2025
1 (2) If the director finds, after notice and hearing in accordance
2 with the Administrative Procedure Act, that any person has knowingly
3 committed any act prohibited by section 93 of this act or otherwise
4 violated the Nebraska Installment Loan and Sales Act or any rule and
5 regulation or order adopted thereunder, the director may order such
6 person to pay (a) an administrative fine of not more than five thousand
7 dollars for each separate violation and (b) the costs of investigation.
8 (3) If a person fails to pay an administrative fine and the costs of
9 investigation ordered pursuant to this section, a lien in the amount of
10 such fine and costs may be imposed upon all assets and property of such
11 person in this state and may be recovered in a civil action by the
12 director. The lien shall attach to the real property of such person when
13 notice of the lien is filed and indexed against the real property in the
14 office of the register of deeds in the county where the real property is
15 located. The lien shall attach to any other property of such person when
16 notice of the lien is filed against the property in the manner prescribed
17 by law. Failure of the person to pay such fine and costs shall constitute
18 a separate violation of the act.
19 (4) The department shall remit fines collected under this section to
20 the State Treasurer for distribution in accordance with Article VII,
21 section 5, of the Constitution of Nebraska.
22 Sec. 101. All original license fees, annual renewal fees,
23 investigation and examination fees, charges, and costs collected by or
24 paid to the department pursuant to the Nebraska Installment Loan and
