Section 1:
LR180 LR180
2025 2025
ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 180
Hughes, 24; Meyer, 17; Quick, 35; Storer, 43; Storm, 23.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine current and future availability and sustainability of nursing facility
care for individuals in Nebraska, including the accessibility for individuals
reliant on Medicaid to pay for their medical care. More than thirty-four
percent of Nebraska's population is over the age of fifty and that number
increases to over forty percent in rural areas of the state. In the future,
these numbers will grow, making access to nursing facilities more challenging.
Ensuring that older Nebraskans have access to appropriate care close to home is
important. Residential nursing care is an integral part of the care continuum
needed to provide individuals with a safe and secure environment and the
medical and daily living assistance they require.
This study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Identifying the availability of nursing facility care in Nebraska,
accessibility for Medicaid beneficiaries, and the future sustainability of this
type of care especially for rural areas of Nebraska; and
(2) Examining the barriers to providing adequate access to care, including
the cost of care, workforce issues, resident demographics, licensure and
regulation, and Medicaid reimbursement rates.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Health and Human Services Committee of the Legislature shall
be designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this
resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
