FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 173
Introduced by McKinney, 11.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
investigate the financial and structural barriers impeding Nebraskans from
attaining homeownership. This study will examine financial and structural
barriers, including, but not limited to, high down payments, limited access to

review the impact of these barriers on economic mobility, and evaluate
potential state or local policy solutions aimed at increasing homeownership
opportunities across Nebraska.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Urban Affairs Committee of the Legislature shall be designated
to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
