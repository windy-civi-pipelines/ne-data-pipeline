26 application for the good life district, the department may consider any
27 formal action taken by the city council or village board of trustees.
28 Proof of such formal action may include resolutions, meeting minutes, or

1 from the good life district. The hearing must be open to the public and

12 supplemental request to the department to increase the size of the good
13 life district by up to one thousand acres. Such supplemental request
14 shall be accompanied by such materials and certifications necessary to
15 demonstrate that such increase would not negatively impact the criteria
16 that were necessary for the original establishment of such good life
17 district.
18 (9) After establishment of a good life district pursuant to this
19 section and after any modification is made to the boundaries of a good
20 life district pursuant to this section, the department shall transmit to
21 any city or village which includes such good life district within its
22 boundaries or within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction (a) all
23 information held by the department related to the application and

25 property included within the good life district, and (c) all
26 documentation transmitted to the applicant for such good life district
27 with approval of the application and establishment of the good life
28 district. Such city or village shall be subject to the same
29 confidentiality restrictions as provided in subsection (3) of section
30 77-4404, except that all such documents, plans, and specifications
31 included in the application which the city or village determine define or
-9-
LB330 LB330
2025 2025
1 describe the project may be provided upon written request of any person
2 who owns property in the applicable good life district.
3 (10) After establishment of a good life district that exceeds one
4 thousand acres in size, the good life district applicant may apply to the
5 department to establish development and design standards for the good
6 life district. Such standards may include, but are not limited to,
7 standards for architectural design, landscape design, construction
8 materials, and sustainability, but may not require property owners to
9 utilize specific contractors, professionals, suppliers, or service
10 providers. The department may approve the standards after holding a
11 hearing after one hundred eighty days' notice to all property owners in
12 the district if the department finds that the standards will ensure a
13 comprehensive and cohesive character and aesthetic for development in the
14 good life district, and that the standards will further the purposes of
15 the Good Life Transformational Projects Act. The development and design
16 standards must be commercially reasonable and consistent with terminology
17 and accepted practices in the architecture industry, must not conflict
18 with any building code or other similar law or regulation, and must not
19 impose an undue burden on property owners in the district. If approved,
20 the standards shall apply to all new construction inside of the good life
21 district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such standards established
22 by the department shall be in addition and supplemental to any local
23 zoning, building code, comprehensive plan, or similar requirements of the
24 city or village, which requirements of the city or village shall control
25 to the extent of any conflict with any design standards established by
26 the department.
27 (11) Demonstration of meeting the required new development costs for
28 purposes of subdivision (2)(a) of this section may be established by
29 evidence submitted by the good life district applicant, the city or
30 village where the good life district is located, or any other person
31 which submits satisfactory evidence to the department.

3 (10) After establishment of a good life district that exceeds one
4 thousand acres in size, the good life district applicant may apply to the

6 life district. Such standards may include, but are not limited to,
7 standards for architectural design, landscape design, construction
8 materials, and sustainability, but may not require property owners to
9 utilize specific contractors, professionals, suppliers, or service

11 hearing after one hundred eighty days' notice to all property owners in
12 the district if the department finds that the standards will ensure a
13 comprehensive and cohesive character and aesthetic for development in the
14 good life district, and that the standards will further the purposes of
15 the Good Life Transformational Projects Act. The development and design
16 standards must be commercially reasonable and consistent with terminology
17 and accepted practices in the architecture industry, must not conflict
18 with any building code or other similar law or regulation, and must not
19 impose an undue burden on property owners in the district. If approved,
20 the standards shall apply to all new construction inside of the good life
21 district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such standards established
22 by the department shall be in addition and supplemental to any local
23 zoning, building code, comprehensive plan, or similar requirements of the
24 city or village, which requirements of the city or village shall control
25 to the extent of any conflict with any design standards established by
26 the department.
27 (11) Demonstration of meeting the required new development costs for
28 purposes of subdivision (2)(a) of this section may be established by
29 evidence submitted by the good life district applicant, the city or
30 village where the good life district is located, or any other person
31 which submits satisfactory evidence to the department.
