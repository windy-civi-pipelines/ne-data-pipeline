5 such amount as a prerequisite to acceptance of the deed for recordation.
6 If a dispute arises concerning the taxability of the transfer, the
7 register of deeds shall not record the deed until the disputed tax is

9 Sec. 7. Section 77-1327, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 77-1327 (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that accurate and
12 comprehensive information be developed by the Property Tax Administrator
13 and made accessible to the taxing officials and property owners in order
14 to ensure the uniformity and proportionality of the assessments of real
15 property valuations in the state in accordance with law and to provide
16 the statistical and narrative reports pursuant to section 77-5027.
17 (2) All transactions of real property for which the statement
18 required in section 76-214 is filed shall be available for development of
19 a sales file by the Property Tax Administrator. All transactions with
20 stated consideration of more than one hundred dollars or upon which more
21 than three two dollars and thirty twenty-five cents in documentary stamp
22 taxes are paid shall be considered sales. All sales shall be deemed to be
23 arm's length transactions unless determined to be otherwise under
24 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques. The Department of
25 Revenue shall not overturn a determination made by a county assessor
26 regarding the qualification of a sale unless the department reviews the
27 sale and determines through the review that the determination made by the
28 county assessor is incorrect.
29 (3) The Property Tax Administrator annually shall make and issue
30 comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of
31 assessment, the degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall

1 compliance with assessment requirements for each major class of real
2 property subject to the property tax in each county. The comprehensive
3 assessment ratio studies shall be developed in compliance with
4 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques and shall employ such
5 statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
6 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The
7 comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file
8 as developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the
9 Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and
10 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property
11 Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by
12 section 79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in
13 establishing assessed valuations.
14 (4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural
15 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections
16 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make
17 and issue a comprehensive study developed in compliance with
18 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques to establish the level
19 of value if in his or her opinion the level of value cannot be developed
20 through the use of the comprehensive assessment ratio studies developed
21 in subsection (3) of this section.
22 (5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically
23 report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property
24 assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the
25 Property Tax Administrator shall deem appropriate. The Property Tax
26 Administrator shall so construct and maintain the system used to collect
27 and analyze the data to enable him or her to make intracounty comparisons
28 of assessed valuation, including school districts and other political
29 subdivisions, as well as intercounty comparisons of assessed valuation,
30 including school districts and other political subdivisions. The Property
31 Tax Administrator shall include analysis of real property sales pursuant

11 77-1327 (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that accurate and
12 comprehensive information be developed by the Property Tax Administrator
13 and made accessible to the taxing officials and property owners in order
14 to ensure the uniformity and proportionality of the assessments of real
15 property valuations in the state in accordance with law and to provide

20 stated consideration of more than one hundred dollars or upon which more
21 than three two dollars and thirty twenty-five cents in documentary stamp
22 taxes are paid shall be considered sales. All sales shall be deemed to be
23 arm's length transactions unless determined to be otherwise under
24 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques. The Department of

5 statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
6 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The
7 comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file
8 as developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the
9 Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and
10 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property
11 Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by
12 section 79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in
13 establishing assessed valuations.
14 (4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural
15 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections
16 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make
17 and issue a comprehensive study developed in compliance with
18 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques to establish the level
19 of value if in his or her opinion the level of value cannot be developed
20 through the use of the comprehensive assessment ratio studies developed
21 in subsection (3) of this section.
22 (5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically
23 report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property
24 assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the
25 Property Tax Administrator shall deem appropriate. The Property Tax
26 Administrator shall so construct and maintain the system used to collect
27 and analyze the data to enable him or her to make intracounty comparisons
28 of assessed valuation, including school districts and other political
29 subdivisions, as well as intercounty comparisons of assessed valuation,
