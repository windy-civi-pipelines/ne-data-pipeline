15 receipt of such pages or copies of such pages from the Secretary of
16 State. The delivery shall be by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement

25 shall strike from the pages of the petition all but the earliest dated
26 signature of any duplicate signatures and such stricken signatures shall
27 not be added to the total number of valid signatures. Not more than

29 subject to the requirements described in subdivision (2)(b)(iv) (3)(b)
30 (iv) of section 84-1411.
31 (b) The board may bring an action in the name of the State of
-85-

LB521 LB521
2025 2025
1 Nebraska for failure to comply with subdivision (a)(iii)(B) of this
2 subsection, except that such subdivision does not apply if a local
3 government entity with the authority to create requirements for
4 decommissioning has enacted decommissioning requirements for the
5 applicable jurisdiction.
6 (c) A joint transmission development agreement shall be entered into
7 to address construction, ownership, operation, and maintenance of such
8 additions or upgrades to the transmission facilities as required for the
9 privately developed renewable energy generation facility. The joint
10 transmission development agreement shall be negotiated and executed
11 contemporaneously with the generator interconnection agreement or other
12 directives of the applicable regional transmission organization with
13 jurisdiction over the addition or upgrade of transmission, upon terms
14 consistent with prudent electric utility practices for the
15 interconnection of renewable generation facilities, the electric
16 supplier's reasonable transmission interconnection requirements, and
17 applicable transmission design and construction standards. The electric
18 supplier shall have the right to purchase and own transmission facilities
19 as set forth in the joint transmission development agreement. The private
20 electric supplier of the privately developed renewable energy generation
21 facility shall have the right to construct any necessary facilities or
22 improvements set forth in the joint transmission development agreement
23 pursuant to the standards set forth in the agreement at the private
24 electric supplier's cost.
25 (3) Within ten days after receipt of a written notice complying with
26 subsection (2) of this section, the executive director of the board shall
27 issue a written acknowledgment that the privately developed renewable
28 energy generation facility is exempt from sections 70-1012 to 70-1014.01
29 if such facility remains in compliance with the requirements of this
30 section.
31 (4) The exemption allowed under this section for a privately
-86-

LB521 LB521
2025 2025
1 developed renewable energy generation facility shall extend to and exempt
2 all private electric suppliers owning any interest in the facility,
3 including any successor private electric supplier which subsequently
4 acquires any interest in the facility.
5 (5) No property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
6 developed renewable energy generation facility shall be subject to
7 eminent domain by a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the
8 State of Nebraska. Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant
9 the power of eminent domain to a private electric supplier or limit the
10 rights of any entity to acquire any public, municipal, or utility right-
11 of-way across property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
12 developed renewable energy generation facility as long as the right-of-
13 way does not prevent the operation of or access to the privately
14 developed renewable energy generation facility.
15 (6) Only a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the State
16 of Nebraska may exercise eminent domain authority to acquire the land
17 rights necessary for the construction of transmission lines and related
18 facilities. There is a rebuttable presumption that the exercise of
19 eminent domain to provide needed transmission lines and related
20 facilities for a privately developed renewable energy generation facility
21 is a public use.
22 (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
23 private electric supplier to sell or deliver electricity at retail in
24 Nebraska.
25 (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
26 authority of or require a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in
27 the State of Nebraska to enter into a joint agreement with a private
28 electric supplier to develop, construct, and jointly own a privately
29 developed renewable energy generation facility.
