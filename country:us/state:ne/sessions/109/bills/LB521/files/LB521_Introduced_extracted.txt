1 voter. The determination of the Secretary of State, election

22 of the signer, the election commissioner or county clerk shall set forth
23 the reason for the invalidity of the signature. If the election
24 commissioner or county clerk determines that a signer has affixed his or
25 her signature more than once to any page or pages of the petition and

5 additional ten days to deliver return all certifications and pages of the
6 petition in extraordinary circumstances.
7 (3) Upon receipt of the pages of the petition, the Secretary of
8 State shall issue a written receipt indicating the number of pages of the
9 petition that are in his or her custody. When all the petitions and
10 certifications have been received by the Secretary of State, he or she
11 shall strike from the pages of the petition all but the earliest dated
12 signature of any duplicate signatures and such stricken signatures shall
13 not be added to the total number of valid signatures. Not more than
14 twenty signatures on one sheet shall be counted. All signatures secured
15 in a manner contrary to sections 32-1401 to 32-1416 shall not be counted.
