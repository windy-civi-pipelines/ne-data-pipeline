15 comparison of names and addresses with the voter registration records, in

29 signer found not to be a registered voter and the petition page number
30 and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for the

5 that only one person is registered by that name, the election
6 commissioner or county clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
7 under seal setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and shall
8 count only the first verified earliest dated signature. The election
9 commissioner or county clerk shall deliver all pages of the petition and
10 the certifications to the Secretary of State within forty days after the
11 receipt of such pages or copies of such pages from the Secretary of
12 State. The delivery shall be by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement
13 officials, or by certified mail , return receipt requested. The Secretary
14 of State may grant to the election commissioner or county clerk an
15 additional ten days to deliver return all certifications and pages of the
16 petition in extraordinary circumstances.
17 (3) Upon receipt of the pages of the petition, the Secretary of
18 State shall issue a written receipt indicating the number of pages of the
19 petition that are in his or her custody. When all the petitions and
20 certifications have been received by the Secretary of State, he or she
21 shall strike from the pages of the petition all but the earliest dated
22 signature of any duplicate signatures and such stricken signatures shall
23 not be added to the total number of valid signatures. Not more than
24 twenty signatures on one sheet shall be counted. All signatures secured
25 in a manner contrary to sections 32-1401 to 32-1416 shall not be counted.
26 Clerical and technical errors in a petition shall be disregarded if the
27 forms prescribed in sections 32-1401 to 32-1403 are substantially

13 resources in Nebraska will become increasingly valuable, both
14 economically and strategically, as the demand for food and energy
15 increases; and
16 (d) The Nebraska Sandhills are home to priceless archaeological
17 sites of historical and cultural significance to American Indians.

12 any such meeting and how many people commented on the proposed facility.
13 Documentation received at any such meeting shall be made available to the
14 board upon its request. A meeting described in this subdivision is not

AM1152 AM1152
LB521 LB521
JNH - 04/23/2025 JNH - 04/23/2025
1 interconnection of renewable generation facilities, the electric
2 supplier's reasonable transmission interconnection requirements, and
3 applicable transmission design and construction standards. The electric
4 supplier shall have the right to purchase and own transmission facilities
5 as set forth in the joint transmission development agreement. The private
6 electric supplier of the privately developed renewable energy generation
7 facility shall have the right to construct any necessary facilities or
8 improvements set forth in the joint transmission development agreement
9 pursuant to the standards set forth in the agreement at the private
10 electric supplier's cost.
11 (3) Within ten days after receipt of a written notice complying with
12 subsection (2) of this section, the executive director of the board shall
13 issue a written acknowledgment that the privately developed renewable
14 energy generation facility is exempt from sections 70-1012 to 70-1014.01
15 if such facility remains in compliance with the requirements of this

17 (4) The exemption allowed under this section for a privately
18 developed renewable energy generation facility shall extend to and exempt
19 all private electric suppliers owning any interest in the facility,

23 developed renewable energy generation facility shall be subject to
24 eminent domain by a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the
25 State of Nebraska. Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant
26 the power of eminent domain to a private electric supplier or limit the
27 rights of any entity to acquire any public, municipal, or utility right-
28 of-way across property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
29 developed renewable energy generation facility as long as the right-of-
30 way does not prevent the operation of or access to the privately
31 developed renewable energy generation facility.

1 (6) Only a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the State
2 of Nebraska may exercise eminent domain authority to acquire the land
3 rights necessary for the construction of transmission lines and related
4 facilities. There is a rebuttable presumption that the exercise of
5 eminent domain to provide needed transmission lines and related
6 facilities for a privately developed renewable energy generation facility
7 is a public use.
8 (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
9 private electric supplier to sell or deliver electricity at retail in
10 Nebraska.
11 (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
12 authority of or require a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in
13 the State of Nebraska to enter into a joint agreement with a private
14 electric supplier to develop, construct, and jointly own a privately
15 developed renewable energy generation facility.

27 rights of any entity to acquire any public, municipal, or utility right-
28 of-way across property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
29 developed renewable energy generation facility as long as the right-of-
30 way does not prevent the operation of or access to the privately
31 developed renewable energy generation facility.

1 (6) Only a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the State
2 of Nebraska may exercise eminent domain authority to acquire the land
3 rights necessary for the construction of transmission lines and related
4 facilities. There is a rebuttable presumption that the exercise of
5 eminent domain to provide needed transmission lines and related
6 facilities for a privately developed renewable energy generation facility
7 is a public use.
8 (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
9 private electric supplier to sell or deliver electricity at retail in
10 Nebraska.
11 (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
12 authority of or require a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in
13 the State of Nebraska to enter into a joint agreement with a private
14 electric supplier to develop, construct, and jointly own a privately
15 developed renewable energy generation facility.
