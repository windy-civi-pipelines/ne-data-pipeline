32-631 (1) Any petition prepared or filed pursuant to the Election Act
shall be filed as one instrument, and no additional petition papers may be

be retained in the election office and shall be open to public inspection. Upon
receipt of the pages of a petition, the Secretary of State, election
commissioner, or county clerk shall issue a written receipt indicating the
number of pages of the petition in his or her custody to the person filing the
petition for signature verification. Petitions may be destroyed twenty-two
months after the election to which they apply.
(2) The election commissioner or county clerk shall determine the validity
and sufficiency of such petition by comparing the names, dates of birth if
applicable, and addresses of the signers with the voter registration records to
determine if the signers were registered voters pursuant to subdivision (1) of
section 32-629 on the date of signing the petition. If it is determined that a
signer has affixed his or her signature more than once to any petition and that
only one person is registered by that name, the election commissioner or county
clerk shall strike from the pages of the petition all but one such signature.
Only one of the duplicate signatures shall be added to the total number of
valid signatures. All signatures, dates of birth, and addresses shall be
presumed to be valid if the election commissioner or county clerk has found the
signers to be registered voters on or before the date on which the petition was
signed. This presumption shall not be conclusive and may be rebutted by any
credible evidence which the election commissioner or county clerk finds
sufficient.
(3) If the election commissioner or county clerk verifies signatures in
excess of one hundred ten percent of the number necessary for the issue to be
placed on the ballot, the election commissioner or county clerk may cease
verifying signatures and certify the number of signatures verified to the
person who delivered the petitions for verification.
(4) If the number of signatures verified does not equal or exceed the
number necessary to place the issue on the ballot upon completion of the
comparison of names and addresses with the voter registration records, the
election commissioner or county clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
under seal setting forth the name and address of each signer found not to be a
registered voter and the petition page number and line number where the
signature is found. If the signature or address is challenged for a reason
other than the nonregistration of the signer, the election commissioner or
county clerk shall set forth the reasons for the challenge of the signature.
(5) The Secretary of State may purchase, lease, lease-purchase, rent, or
contract for software that assists in processing a filed petition. Such

amended to read:
32-1409 (1) Upon the receipt of the petitions, the Secretary of State,
with the aid and assistance of the election commissioner or county clerk, shall
determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the pages of the filed
petition. The various pages of the filed petition may remain in the office of
the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall deliver the various pages
or copies of the various pages of the filed petition to the election
commissioner or county clerk by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement
officials, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a secure
method designated by the Secretary of State. Upon receipt of the pages of the
petition, the election commissioner or county clerk shall issue to the

sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison of names and addresses with
the voter registration records, in addition to helping to determine the
validity of such petition, the sufficiency of such petition, and the
qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud, deception, and
misrepresentation in the petition process. If the Secretary of State receives
reports from a sufficient number of the counties that signatures in excess of
one hundred ten percent of the number necessary to place the issue on the
ballot have been verified, the Secretary of State may instruct the election
commissioners and county clerks in all counties to stop verifying signatures
and certify the number of signatures verified as of receipt of the instruction
-27-

from the Secretary of State.
(2) Upon completion of the determination of registration, the election
commissioner or county clerk shall prepare in writing a certification under
seal setting forth the name and address of each signer found not to be a
registered voter and the petition page number and line number where the name is
found, and if the reason for the invalidity of the signature or address is
other than the nonregistration of the signer, the election commissioner or
county clerk shall set forth the reason for the invalidity of the signature. If
the election commissioner or county clerk determines that a signer has affixed
his or her signature more than once to any page or pages of the petition and
that only one person is registered by that name, the election commissioner or
county clerk shall prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth
the name of the duplicate signature and shall count only the first verified
earliest dated signature. The election commissioner or county clerk shall
deliver all pages of the petition and the certifications to the Secretary of
State within forty days after the receipt of such pages or copies of such pages
from the Secretary of State. The delivery shall be by hand carrier, by use of
law enforcement officials, or by certified mail , return receipt requested. The
Secretary of State may grant to the election commissioner or county clerk an
additional ten days to deliver return all certifications and pages of the
petition in extraordinary circumstances.
(3) Upon receipt of the pages of the petition, the Secretary of State
shall issue a written receipt indicating the number of pages of the petition
that are in his or her custody. When all the petitions and certifications have
been received by the Secretary of State, he or she shall strike from the pages
of the petition all but the earliest dated signature of any duplicate
signatures and such stricken signatures shall not be added to the total number
of valid signatures. Not more than twenty signatures on one sheet shall be
counted. All signatures secured in a manner contrary to sections 32-1401 to
32-1416 shall not be counted. Clerical and technical errors in a petition shall
be disregarded if the forms prescribed in sections 32-1401 to 32-1403 are
substantially followed. The Secretary of State shall total the valid signatures
and determine if constitutional and statutory requirements have been met. The
Secretary of State shall immediately serve a copy of such determination by the
most expeditious method available certified or registered mail upon the person
filing the initiative or referendum petition. If the petition is found to be
valid and sufficient, the Secretary of State shall proceed to place the measure
on the general election ballot.
(4) The Secretary of State may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
for the issuance of all necessary forms and procedural instructions to carry
out this section.
