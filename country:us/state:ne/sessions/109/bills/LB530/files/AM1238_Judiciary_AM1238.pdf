1 which probation personnel or probation resources are utilized pursuant to
2 an interlocal agreement authorized by subdivision (16) of section 29-2252

11 based program or service who defaults on the payment of any such fees
12 may, at the discretion of the court, be subject to removal from such non-
13 probation-based program or service. This subdivision does not preclude a
14 court or other governmental entity from charging additional local fees
15 for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services or
16 other similar non-probation-based programs and services.

1 participation in a non-probation-based program or service.
2 (4) The court shall waive payment of the monthly probation
3 programming fees in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination
4 is made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the
5 offender due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical
6 or mental handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period
7 of time that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based
8 program or service is unable to pay his or her monthly probation
9 programming fee.
10 (5) If a probationer defaults in the payment of monthly probation
11 programming fees or any installment thereof, the court may revoke his or
12 her probation for nonpayment, except that probation shall not be revoked
13 nor shall the offender be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
14 probationer is financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so
15 states to the court in writing under oath, and if the court so finds
16 after a hearing.
17 (6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
18 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
19 refusal to obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's
20 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
21 payment, the court may enter an order allowing the probationer additional
22 time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking
23 the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.
24 (7) No probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program
25 or service shall be required to pay more than one monthly probation
26 programming fee per month. This subsection does not preclude local fees
27 as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

29 section shall be considered separate and apart from the fees described in
30 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262.

2 offender has been previously found to be indigent in the case for which
3 he or she is placed on probation or if after a hearing a determination is
4 made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the offender
5 due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental
6 handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time
7 that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program or
8 service is unable to pay his or her monthly probation programming fee.
9 (10) (9) Any adult probationer received for supervision pursuant to
10 section 29-2637 or the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision
11 shall be assessed both a one-time administrative enrollment fee and
12 monthly probation programming fees during the period of time the
13 probationer is actively supervised by Nebraska probation authorities.
14 (11) (10) The probationer or participant in a non-probation-based
15 program or service shall pay the fees described in this section to the
16 clerk of the court. The clerk of the court shall remit all fees so
17 collected to the State Treasurer for credit to the Probation Program Cash
18 Fund.

24 years upon conviction of a felony or second offense misdemeanor and two
25 years upon conviction of a first offense misdemeanor.
26 (b) At sentencing, the court shall provide notice to the offender
27 that the offender may be eligible to have the conviction set aside as

18 (4)(a) Upon completion of the term of probation, or the earlier

23 the entire period or after discharge from probation prior to the
