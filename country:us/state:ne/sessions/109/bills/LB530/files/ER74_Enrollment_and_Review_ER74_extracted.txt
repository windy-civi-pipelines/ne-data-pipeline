6 probation-based program or service. This subdivision does not preclude a
7 court or other governmental entity from charging additional local fees
8 for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services or
9 other similar non-probation-based programs and services.
10 (3) The court shall establish the administrative enrollment fee and

27 programming fees in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination
28 is made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the

31 of time that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based

2 programming fee.

4 programming fees or any installment thereof, the court may revoke his or

6 nor shall the offender be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
7 probationer is financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so
8 states to the court in writing under oath, and if the court so finds
9 after a hearing.
10 (6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
11 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
12 refusal to obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's
13 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
14 payment, the court may enter an order allowing the probationer additional
15 time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking
16 the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.
17 (7) No probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program

23 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262.
24 (9) The court may waive payment of the fees described in
25 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262 in whole or in part if the
26 offender has been previously found to be indigent in the case for which
27 he or she is placed on probation or if after a hearing a determination is
28 made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the offender
29 due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental
30 handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time
31 that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program or

9 43-286.01 (1) For purposes of this section: ,
10 (a) Criminal violation means a violation of a condition of probation
11 involving commission of a misdemeanor or felony. Criminal violation does
12 not include a traffic offense;
13 (b) Graduated graduated response means an accountability-based
14 series of sanctions, incentives, and services designed to facilitate the
15 juvenile’s continued progress in changing behavior, ongoing compliance,
16 and successful completion of probation. Graduated response does not
17 include restrictions of liberty that would otherwise require a hearing
18 under subsection (3) of section 43-253; and .
19 (c) High-risk juvenile probationer means a juvenile determined to be
20 such under section 17 of this act.
21 (2)(a) (2) The Office of Probation Administration may establish a
22 statewide standardized graduated response matrix of incentives for
23 compliance and positive behaviors and sanctions for probationers who
24 violate the terms and conditions of a court order. The graduated response
25 system shall use recognized best practices and be developed with the
26 input of stakeholders, including judges, probation officers, county
27 attorneys, defense attorneys, juveniles, and parents. The office shall
28 provide implementation and ongoing training to all probation officers on
29 the graduated response options.
30 (b) (3) Graduated response sanctions should be immediate, certain,

-34-
ER74 ER74
LB530 LB530
AJC - 05/06/2025 AJC - 05/06/2025
1 complete a sanction may result in repeating the sanction, increasing the
2 duration, or selecting a different sanction similar in nature. Continued
3 failure to comply could result in a request for a motion to revoke
4 probation. Once a sanction is successfully completed the alleged
5 probation violation is deemed resolved and cannot be alleged as a
6 violation in future proceedings.
7 (c) (4) Graduated response incentives should provide positive
8 reinforcement to encourage and support positive behavior change and
9 compliance with court-ordered conditions of probation.
10 (3)(a) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this
11 section, when (5) Whenever a probation officer has reasonable cause to
12 believe that a juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a
13 probation officer has committed a violation of the terms of the
14 juvenile's probation while on probation, but that such juvenile will not
15 attempt to leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in
16 danger, the probation officer shall either:
17 (i) (a) Impose one or more graduated response sanctions with the
18 approval of his or her chief probation officer or such chief's designee.
19 The decision to impose graduated response sanctions in lieu of formal
20 revocation proceedings rests with the probation officer and his or her
21 chief probation officer or such chief's designee and shall be based upon
22 such juvenile's risk level, the severity of the violation, and the
23 juvenile's response to the violation. If graduated response sanctions are
24 to be imposed, such juvenile shall acknowledge in writing the nature of
25 the violation and agree upon the graduated response sanction with
26 approval of such juvenile's parents or guardian. Such juvenile has the
27 right to decline to acknowledge the violation, and if he or she declines
28 to acknowledge the violation, the probation officer shall submit a
29 written report pursuant to subdivision (3)(a)(ii) (5)(b) of this section.
30 If the juvenile fails to satisfy the graduated response sanctions and the
31 office determines that a motion to revoke probation should be pursued,
-35-
ER74 ER74
LB530 LB530
AJC - 05/06/2025 AJC - 05/06/2025
1 the probation officer shall submit a written report pursuant to

8 violation and request that formal revocation proceedings be instituted
9 against the juvenile subject to the supervision of a probation officer.

11 response sanctions were not utilized or were ineffective. If there is no
12 attorney of record for the juvenile, the office shall notify the court
13 and counsel for the juvenile shall be appointed.
14 (b) Whenever a graduated response sanction is imposed, the probation
15 officer shall provide the county attorney of the county where probation
16 was imposed with notice of the sanction.

18 has reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile probationer has
19 committed a violation of the terms of the juvenile's probation, other
20 than a criminal violation, and that such juvenile will not attempt to
21 leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in danger,
22 the probation officer may impose one or more graduated response sanctions
23 under subdivision (3)(a)(i) of this section. However, the probation
24 officer may only do so one time. For any subsequent violation of the
25 terms of the juvenile's probation, the officer shall proceed as provided
26 in subdivision (3)(a)(ii) or subsection (5) or (6) of this section, as
27 appropriate.

7 that a juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a probation
8 officer has violated a condition of his or her probation and that such
9 juvenile will attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place lives or
10 property in danger, the probation officer shall take such juvenile into
11 temporary custody without a warrant and may call on any peace officer for
12 assistance as provided in section 43-248. Continued detention or
13 deprivation of liberty shall be subject to the criteria and requirements
14 of sections 43-251.01, 43-260, and 43-260.01 and subdivision (5)(b)(iv)
15 of section 43-286, and a hearing shall be held before the court within
16 twenty-four hours as provided in subsection (3) of section 43-253.
17 (7) Immediately after detention or deprivation of liberty pursuant
18 to subsection (6) of this section, the probation officer shall notify the
19 county attorney of the county where probation was imposed and the
20 juvenile's attorney of record and submit a written report describing the
21 risk of harm to lives or property or of fleeing the jurisdiction which
22 precipitated the need for such detention or deprivation of liberty and of
23 any violation of probation. If there is no attorney of record for the
24 juvenile, the office shall notify the court and counsel for the juvenile
25 shall be appointed. After prompt consideration of the written report, the
26 county attorney shall:
27 (a) Order the release of the juvenile from confinement or
28 alternative to detention subject to the supervision of a probation
29 officer; or

4 officer is seeking revocation of probation, the county attorney may file
5 a motion to revoke probation.
6 (9) Whenever a juvenile probationer subject to supervision of a
7 probation officer is engaging in positive behavior, completion of goals,
8 and compliance with the terms of probation, the probation officer shall
9 use graduated incentives to provide positive reinforcement and
10 encouragement of such behavior. The office shall keep records of all
11 incentives and provide such records to the county attorney or the
12 juvenile’s attorney upon request.
13 (10) During the term of probation, the court, on application of a
14 probation officer or of the juvenile or on its own motion, may reduce or
15 eliminate any of the conditions imposed on the juvenile. Upon completion
16 of the term of probation or the earlier discharge of the juvenile, the

2 Sec. 6. Section 28-1204.05, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
3 2024, is amended to read:
4 28-1204.05 (1) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this
5 section, a person under the age of twenty-five years who knowingly
6 possesses a firearm commits the offense of possession of a firearm by a
7 prohibited juvenile offender if he or she has previously been adjudicated
8 an offender in juvenile court for an act which would constitute a felony
9 or an act which would constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic
10 violence. This subsection includes an offense for which a juvenile record
11 has been sealed upon termination of probation.
12 (2) Possession of a firearm by a prohibited juvenile offender is a
13 Class IV felony for a first offense and a Class IIIA felony for a second
14 or subsequent offense.
15 (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to the possession
16 of firearms by members of the armed forces of the United States, active
17 or reserve, National Guard of this state, or Reserve Officers Training

19 when on duty or training.
20 (4)(a) Prior to reaching the age of twenty-five years, a person
21 subject to the prohibition of subsection (1) of this section may file a
22 petition for exemption from such prohibition and thereby have his or her

24 nineteen years of age shall petition the juvenile court in which he or
25 she was adjudicated for the underlying offense. A petitioner who is
26 nineteen years of age or older shall petition the district court in the
27 county in which he or she resides.
28 (b) In determining whether to grant a petition filed under
29 subdivision (4)(a) of this section, the court shall consider:
30 (i) The behavior of the person after the underlying adjudication;
31 (ii) The likelihood that the person will engage in further criminal

LB530 LB530
AJC - 05/06/2025 AJC - 05/06/2025
1 activity; and
2 (iii) Any other information the court considers relevant.
3 (c) The court may grant a petition filed under subdivision (4)(a) of

5 of subsection (1) of this section when in the opinion of the court the
6 order will be in the best interests of the person and consistent with the
7 public welfare.
8 (5) The fact that a person subject to the prohibition under
9 subsection (1) of this section has reached the age of twenty-five or that
10 a court has granted a petition under subdivision (4)(a) of this section
11 shall not be construed to mean that such adjudication has been set aside.

1 addition, the provisions of subsections (4), (7), and (11) (10) of this
2 section applicable to probationers apply to participants in non-
3 probation-based programs or services. Any participant in a non-probation-
4 based program or service who defaults on the payment of any such fees
5 may, at the discretion of the court, be subject to removal from such non-
6 probation-based program or service. This subdivision does not preclude a
7 court or other governmental entity from charging additional local fees
8 for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services or
9 other similar non-probation-based programs and services.
10 (3) The court shall establish the administrative enrollment fee and
11 monthly probation programming fees as follows:
12 (a) Adult probationers placed on either probation or intensive
13 supervision probation and participants in non-probation-based programs or
14 services shall pay a one-time administrative enrollment fee of thirty
15 dollars. The fee shall be paid in a lump sum upon the beginning of
16 probation supervision or participation in a non-probation-based program
17 or service;
18 (b) Adult probationers placed on probation shall pay a monthly
19 probation programming fee of twenty-five dollars, not later than the

22 participants in non-probation-based programs or services shall pay a

24 the tenth day of each month, for the duration of probation or
25 participation in a non-probation-based program or service.
26 (4) The court shall waive payment of the monthly probation
27 programming fees in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination
28 is made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the
29 offender due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical
30 or mental handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period
31 of time that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based
-14-

LB530 LB530
AJC - 05/06/2025 AJC - 05/06/2025
1 program or service is unable to pay his or her monthly probation
2 programming fee.
3 (5) If a probationer defaults in the payment of monthly probation
4 programming fees or any installment thereof, the court may revoke his or
5 her probation for nonpayment, except that probation shall not be revoked
6 nor shall the offender be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
7 probationer is financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so
8 states to the court in writing under oath, and if the court so finds
9 after a hearing.
10 (6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
11 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
12 refusal to obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's
13 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
14 payment, the court may enter an order allowing the probationer additional
15 time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking
16 the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.
17 (7) No probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program
18 or service shall be required to pay more than one monthly probation
19 programming fee per month. This subsection does not preclude local fees
20 as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
21 (8) The imposition of monthly probation programming fees in this
22 section shall be considered separate and apart from the fees described in
23 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262.
24 (9) The court may waive payment of the fees described in
25 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262 in whole or in part if the
26 offender has been previously found to be indigent in the case for which
27 he or she is placed on probation or if after a hearing a determination is
28 made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the offender
29 due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental
30 handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time
31 that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program or

6 probationer is actively supervised by Nebraska probation authorities.
7 (11) (10) The probationer or participant in a non-probation-based
8 program or service shall pay the fees described in this section to the
9 clerk of the court. The clerk of the court shall remit all fees so

23 shall develop standardized advisement language and any forms necessary to
24 carry out this subdivision.
25 (c) The court, on application of a probation officer or of the
26 probationer or on its own motion, may discharge a probationer at any
27 time.
28 (2) When a court has sentenced an offender to post-release
29 supervision, the court shall specify the term of such post-release
30 supervision as provided in section 28-105. The court, on application of a

5 conditions authorized by section 29-2262. The court on joint application
6 of the probation officer and the probationer may extend the term of
7 probation within the limits authorized by subdivision (1)(a) of this
8 section. This subsection does not preclude a probation officer from
9 imposing administrative sanctions with the probationer's full knowledge
10 and consent as authorized by sections 29-2266.01 and 29-2266.02.
11 (4)(a) Upon completion of the term of probation, or the earlier
12 discharge of the probationer, the probationer shall be relieved of any
13 obligations imposed by the order of the court and shall have satisfied
14 the sentence for his or her crime.
15 (b) Upon satisfactory fulfillment of the conditions of probation for
16 the entire period or after discharge from probation prior to the
17 termination of the period of probation, a probation officer shall notify
18 the probationer that the probationer may be eligible to have the
19 conviction set aside as provided in subsection (2) of section 29-2264.
20 The notice shall include an explanation of the requirements for a
21 conviction to be set aside, how to file a petition for a conviction to be
22 set aside, and the effect of and limitations of having a conviction set
23 aside and an advisement that the probationer consult with an attorney
24 prior to filing a petition. The State Court Administrator shall develop
25 standardized advisement language and any forms necessary to carry out
26 this subdivision.

18 probation term may be extended at the joint request of the probationer
19 and prosecutor until final resolution of the motion or information to

11 involving commission of a misdemeanor or felony. Criminal violation does
12 not include a traffic offense;
13 (b) Graduated graduated response means an accountability-based
14 series of sanctions, incentives, and services designed to facilitate the
15 juvenile’s continued progress in changing behavior, ongoing compliance,
16 and successful completion of probation. Graduated response does not
17 include restrictions of liberty that would otherwise require a hearing

ER74 ER74

AJC - 05/06/2025 AJC - 05/06/2025
1 complete a sanction may result in repeating the sanction, increasing the
2 duration, or selecting a different sanction similar in nature. Continued
3 failure to comply could result in a request for a motion to revoke
4 probation. Once a sanction is successfully completed the alleged
5 probation violation is deemed resolved and cannot be alleged as a
6 violation in future proceedings.
7 (c) (4) Graduated response incentives should provide positive
8 reinforcement to encourage and support positive behavior change and
9 compliance with court-ordered conditions of probation.
10 (3)(a) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this

13 probation officer has committed a violation of the terms of the
14 juvenile's probation while on probation, but that such juvenile will not
15 attempt to leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in
16 danger, the probation officer shall either:
17 (i) (a) Impose one or more graduated response sanctions with the
18 approval of his or her chief probation officer or such chief's designee.
19 The decision to impose graduated response sanctions in lieu of formal
20 revocation proceedings rests with the probation officer and his or her
21 chief probation officer or such chief's designee and shall be based upon
22 such juvenile's risk level, the severity of the violation, and the
23 juvenile's response to the violation. If graduated response sanctions are
24 to be imposed, such juvenile shall acknowledge in writing the nature of
25 the violation and agree upon the graduated response sanction with
26 approval of such juvenile's parents or guardian. Such juvenile has the
27 right to decline to acknowledge the violation, and if he or she declines
28 to acknowledge the violation, the probation officer shall submit a
29 written report pursuant to subdivision (3)(a)(ii) (5)(b) of this section.
