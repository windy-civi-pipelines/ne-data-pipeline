11 fleeing from law enforcement, absconding from a court-ordered placement,
12 absconding from home, committing a violent offense, committing multiple
13 property crimes, or threatening to cause harm to self or others.
14 Sec. 16. Section 43-260.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
15 2024, is amended to read:
16 43-260.01 The need for preadjudication placement, services, or
17 supervision and the need for detention of a juvenile and whether
18 detention or an alternative to detention is indicated shall be subject to
19 subdivision (5) of section 43-251.01 and shall be determined as follows:
20 (1) The standardized juvenile detention screening instrument shall
21 be used to evaluate the juvenile;
22 (2) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(b) of section 43-250, if
23 If the results indicate that detention is not required, the juvenile
24 shall be released without restriction or released to an alternative to
25 detention; and
26 (3) If the results indicate that detention is required, detention
27 shall be pursued.
28 Sec. 17. (1) If a juvenile court decides to place a juvenile on
29 probation, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the
30 juvenile is a high-risk juvenile probationer. The hearing may be
31 conducted together with the dispositional hearing or following a motion
-14-

LB530 LB530
AJC - 04/29/2025 AJC - 04/29/2025
1 to revoke probation following the procedures provided in subdivision (5)
2 (b) of section 43-286.
3 (2) The court shall designate a juvenile as a high-risk juvenile
4 probationer if the court determines that the juvenile is unlikely to
5 respond effectively to graduated response sanctions under section
6 43-286.01, taking into account:
7 (a) The nature of the adjudication;
8 (b) The effectiveness of any past interventions or sanctions;
9 (c) The recommendation of the probation officer;
10 (d) The recommendation from law enforcement; and
11 (e) The recommendation from the county attorney or city attorney.
12 Sec. 18. Section 43-286.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
13 2024, is amended to read:
14 43-286.01 (1) For purposes of this section: ,
15 (a) Criminal violation means a violation of a condition of probation
16 involving commission of a misdemeanor or felony. Criminal violation does
17 not include a traffic offense;
18 (b) Graduated graduated response means an accountability-based
19 series of sanctions, incentives, and services designed to facilitate the
20 juvenile’s continued progress in changing behavior, ongoing compliance,
21 and successful completion of probation. Graduated response does not
22 include restrictions of liberty that would otherwise require a hearing
23 under subsection (3) of section 43-253; and .
24 (c) High-risk juvenile probationer means a juvenile determined to be
25 such under section 17 of this act.
26 (2)(a) (2) The Office of Probation Administration may establish a
27 statewide standardized graduated response matrix of incentives for
28 compliance and positive behaviors and sanctions for probationers who
29 violate the terms and conditions of a court order. The graduated response
30 system shall use recognized best practices and be developed with the
31 input of stakeholders, including judges, probation officers, county
-15-

AM1218 AM1218
LB530 LB530
AJC - 04/29/2025 AJC - 04/29/2025
1 attorneys, defense attorneys, juveniles, and parents. The office shall
2 provide implementation and ongoing training to all probation officers on
3 the graduated response options.
4 (b) (3) Graduated response sanctions should be immediate, certain,
5 consistent, and fair to appropriately address the behavior. Failure to
6 complete a sanction may result in repeating the sanction, increasing the
7 duration, or selecting a different sanction similar in nature. Continued
8 failure to comply could result in a request for a motion to revoke
9 probation. Once a sanction is successfully completed the alleged
10 probation violation is deemed resolved and cannot be alleged as a
11 violation in future proceedings.
12 (c) (4) Graduated response incentives should provide positive
13 reinforcement to encourage and support positive behavior change and
14 compliance with court-ordered conditions of probation.
15 (3)(a) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this
16 section, when (5) Whenever a probation officer has reasonable cause to
17 believe that a juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a
18 probation officer has committed a violation of the terms of the
19 juvenile's probation while on probation, but that such juvenile will not
20 attempt to leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in
21 danger, the probation officer shall either:
22 (i) (a) Impose one or more graduated response sanctions with the
23 approval of his or her chief probation officer or such chief's designee.
24 The decision to impose graduated response sanctions in lieu of formal
25 revocation proceedings rests with the probation officer and his or her
26 chief probation officer or such chief's designee and shall be based upon
27 such juvenile's risk level, the severity of the violation, and the
28 juvenile's response to the violation. If graduated response sanctions are
29 to be imposed, such juvenile shall acknowledge in writing the nature of
30 the violation and agree upon the graduated response sanction with
31 approval of such juvenile's parents or guardian. Such juvenile has the
-16-

AM1218 AM1218
LB530 LB530
AJC - 04/29/2025 AJC - 04/29/2025
1 right to decline to acknowledge the violation, and if he or she declines
2 to acknowledge the violation, the probation officer shall submit a
3 written report pursuant to subdivision (3)(a)(ii) (5)(b) of this section.
4 If the juvenile fails to satisfy the graduated response sanctions and the
5 office determines that a motion to revoke probation should be pursued,
6 the probation officer shall submit a written report pursuant to
7 subdivision (3)(a)(ii) (5)(b) of this section. A copy of the report shall
8 be submitted to the county attorney of the county where probation was
9 imposed; or
10 (ii) (b) Submit a written report to the county attorney of the
11 county where probation was imposed and to the juvenile’s attorney of
12 record. The report shall outline , outlining the nature of the probation
13 violation and request that formal revocation proceedings be instituted
14 against the juvenile subject to the supervision of a probation officer.
15 The report shall also include a statement regarding why graduated
16 response sanctions were not utilized or were ineffective. If there is no
17 attorney of record for the juvenile, the office shall notify the court
18 and counsel for the juvenile shall be appointed.
19 (b) Whenever a graduated response sanction is imposed, the probation
20 officer shall provide the county attorney of the county where probation
21 was imposed with notice of the sanction.
22 (4) For a high-risk juvenile probationer, when a probation officer
23 has reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile probationer has
24 committed a violation of the terms of the juvenile's probation, other
25 than a criminal violation, and that such juvenile will not attempt to
26 leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in danger,
27 the probation officer may impose one or more graduated response sanctions
28 under subdivision (3)(a)(i) of this section. However, the probation
29 officer may only do so one time. For any subsequent violation of the
30 terms of the juvenile's probation, the officer shall proceed as provided
31 in subdivision (3)(a)(ii) or subsection (5) or (6) of this section, as
-17-

AM1218 AM1218
LB530 LB530
AJC - 04/29/2025 AJC - 04/29/2025
1 appropriate.
2 (5) When a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
3 juvenile probationer has committed a violation of the terms of the
4 juvenile's probation that is a criminal violation, the probation officer
5 shall submit a written report to the county attorney of the county where
6 probation was imposed and to the juvenile's attorney of record. The
7 report shall outline the nature of the probation violation and request
8 that formal revocation proceedings be instituted against the juvenile. If
9 there is no attorney of record for the juvenile, the office shall notify
10 the court, and counsel for the juvenile shall be appointed.
11 (6) Whenever a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe
12 that a juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a probation
13 officer has violated a condition of his or her probation and that such
14 juvenile will attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place lives or
15 property in danger, the probation officer shall take such juvenile into
16 temporary custody without a warrant and may call on any peace officer for
17 assistance as provided in section 43-248. Continued detention or
18 deprivation of liberty shall be subject to the criteria and requirements
19 of sections 43-251.01, 43-260, and 43-260.01 and subdivision (5)(b)(iv)
20 of section 43-286, and a hearing shall be held before the court within
21 twenty-four hours as provided in subsection (3) of section 43-253.
22 (7) Immediately after detention or deprivation of liberty pursuant
23 to subsection (6) of this section, the probation officer shall notify the
24 county attorney of the county where probation was imposed and the
25 juvenile's attorney of record and submit a written report describing the
26 risk of harm to lives or property or of fleeing the jurisdiction which
27 precipitated the need for such detention or deprivation of liberty and of
28 any violation of probation. If there is no attorney of record for the
29 juvenile, the office shall notify the court and counsel for the juvenile
30 shall be appointed. After prompt consideration of the written report, the
31 county attorney shall:
-18-

AM1218 AM1218
LB530 LB530
AJC - 04/29/2025 AJC - 04/29/2025
1 (a) Order the release of the juvenile from confinement or
2 alternative to detention subject to the supervision of a probation
3 officer; or
4 (b) File with the adjudicating court a motion to revoke the
5 probation.
6 (8) Whenever a county attorney receives a report from a probation
7 officer that a juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a
8 probation officer has violated a condition of probation and the probation
9 officer is seeking revocation of probation, the county attorney may file
10 a motion to revoke probation.
11 (9) Whenever a juvenile probationer subject to supervision of a
12 probation officer is engaging in positive behavior, completion of goals,
13 and compliance with the terms of probation, the probation officer shall
14 use graduated incentives to provide positive reinforcement and
15 encouragement of such behavior. The office shall keep records of all
16 incentives and provide such records to the county attorney or the
17 juvenile’s attorney upon request.
18 (10) During the term of probation, the court, on application of a
19 probation officer or of the juvenile or on its own motion, may reduce or
20 eliminate any of the conditions imposed on the juvenile. Upon completion
21 of the term of probation or the earlier discharge of the juvenile, the
22 juvenile shall be relieved of any obligations imposed by the order of the
23 court and his or her record shall be sealed pursuant to section
24 43-2,108.04.
25 (11) The probation administrator shall adopt and promulgate rules
26 and regulations to carry out this section.
27 Sec. 19. (1) At least fourteen calendar days before the expiration

29 progress report to the county attorney and to the juvenile's attorney of
30 record. The progress report shall include all court orders relating to
31 such term of probation, information on all conditions of probation, and
-19-

1 information regarding the juvenile's compliance with, or violations of,
2 such conditions.
3 (2) If the county attorney determines that revocation is
4 appropriate, the county attorney may file a motion to revoke probation.
5 If there is no attorney of record for the juvenile, counsel for the
6 juvenile shall be appointed. If such motion is filed no later than seven
7 calendar days before the expiration of the term of probation, the court
8 shall schedule a revocation hearing prior to the date of expiration.
9 Sec. 20. Section 43-2,108, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
10 2024, is amended to read:
11 43-2,108 (1) The juvenile court judge shall keep a record of all
