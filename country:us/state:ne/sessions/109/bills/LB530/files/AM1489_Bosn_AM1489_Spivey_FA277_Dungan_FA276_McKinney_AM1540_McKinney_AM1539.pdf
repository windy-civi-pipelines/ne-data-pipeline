7 probation-based program or service. This subdivision does not preclude a
8 court or other governmental entity from charging additional local fees
9 for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services or
10 other similar non-probation-based programs and services.
11 (3) The court shall establish the administrative enrollment fee and
12 monthly probation programming fees as follows:
13 (a) Adult probationers placed on either probation or intensive
14 supervision probation and participants in non-probation-based programs or

17 probation supervision or participation in a non-probation-based program
18 or service;
19 (b) Adult probationers placed on probation shall pay a monthly
20 probation programming fee of twenty-five dollars, not later than the

5 programming fees or any installment thereof, the court may revoke his or
6 her probation for nonpayment, except that probation shall not be revoked
7 nor shall the offender be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
8 probationer is financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so
9 states to the court in writing under oath, and if the court so finds
10 after a hearing.
11 (6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
12 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
13 refusal to obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's
14 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
15 payment, the court may enter an order allowing the probationer additional
16 time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking
17 the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.
18 (7) No probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program
19 or service shall be required to pay more than one monthly probation
20 programming fee per month. This subsection does not preclude local fees

25 (9) The court may waive payment of the fees described in
26 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262 in whole or in part if the
27 offender has been previously found to be indigent in the case for which
28 he or she is placed on probation or if after a hearing a determination is
29 made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the offender
30 due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental
31 handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time

8 (2) The court shall designate a juvenile as a comprehensive

LB530 LB530
AJC - 05/15/2025 AJC - 05/15/2025
1 not include a traffic offense; and
2 (c) Graduated graduated response means an accountability-based
3 series of sanctions, incentives, and services designed to facilitate the
4 juvenile’s continued progress in changing behavior, ongoing compliance,
5 and successful completion of probation. Graduated response does not
6 include restrictions of liberty that would otherwise require a hearing
7 under subsection (3) of section 43-253.
8 (2)(a) (2) The Office of Probation Administration may establish a
9 statewide standardized graduated response matrix of incentives for
10 compliance and positive behaviors and sanctions for probationers who
11 violate the terms and conditions of a court order. The graduated response
12 system shall use recognized best practices and be developed with the

22 probation. Once a sanction is successfully completed the alleged
23 probation violation is deemed resolved and cannot be alleged as a
24 violation in future proceedings.
25 (c) (4) Graduated response incentives should provide positive
26 reinforcement to encourage and support positive behavior change and
27 compliance with court-ordered conditions of probation.

6 The decision to impose graduated response sanctions in lieu of formal
7 revocation proceedings rests with the probation officer and his or her
8 chief probation officer or such chief's designee and shall be based upon
9 such juvenile's risk level, the severity of the violation, and the
10 juvenile's response to the violation. If graduated response sanctions are
11 to be imposed, such juvenile shall acknowledge in writing the nature of
12 the violation and agree upon the graduated response sanction with
13 approval of such juvenile's parents or guardian. Such juvenile has the

20 subdivision (3)(a)(ii) (5)(b) of this section. A copy of the report shall
21 be submitted to the county attorney of the county where probation was

24 county where probation was imposed and to the juvenile’s attorney of
25 record. The report shall outline , outlining the nature of the probation
26 violation and request that formal revocation proceedings be instituted
27 against the juvenile subject to the supervision of a probation officer.

29 response sanctions were not utilized or were ineffective. If there is no
30 attorney of record for the juvenile, the office shall notify the court

4 subsequent violations of the terms of the juvenile's probation, the
5 probation officer shall proceed as provided in subdivision (3)(a)(ii) or
6 subsection (4) of this section, as appropriate.

22 assistance as provided in section 43-248. Continued detention or
23 deprivation of liberty shall be subject to the criteria and requirements
24 of sections 43-251.01, 43-260, and 43-260.01 and subdivision (5)(b)(iv)
25 of section 43-286, and a hearing shall be held before the court within
26 twenty-four hours as provided in subsection (3) of section 43-253.
27 (5) (7) Immediately after detention or deprivation of liberty
28 pursuant to subsection (4) (6) of this section, the probation officer

15 may file a motion to revoke probation.
16 (7) (9) Whenever a juvenile probationer subject to supervision of a
17 probation officer is engaging in positive behavior, completion of goals,
18 and compliance with the terms of probation, the probation officer shall
19 use graduated incentives to provide positive reinforcement and
20 encouragement of such behavior. The office shall keep records of all
21 incentives and provide such records to the county attorney or the
22 juvenile’s attorney upon request.
23 (8) (10) During the term of probation, the court, on application of
24 a probation officer or of the juvenile or on its own motion, may reduce
