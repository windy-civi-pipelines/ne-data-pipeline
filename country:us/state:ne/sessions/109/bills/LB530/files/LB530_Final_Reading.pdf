16 administrative enrollment fee and thereafter a monthly probation
17 programming fee.
18 (2) Participants in non-probation-based programs or services in
19 which probation personnel or probation resources are utilized pursuant to
20 an interlocal agreement authorized by subdivision (16) of section 29-2252

-15-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
1 court or other governmental entity from charging additional local fees
2 for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services or
3 other similar non-probation-based programs and services.
4 (3) The court shall establish the administrative enrollment fee and
5 monthly probation programming fees as follows:
6 (a) Adult probationers placed on either probation or intensive
7 supervision probation and participants in non-probation-based programs or

18 the tenth day of each month, for the duration of probation or
19 participation in a non-probation-based program or service.
20 (4) The court shall waive payment of the monthly probation
21 programming fees in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination
22 is made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the
23 offender due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical
24 or mental handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period
25 of time that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based
26 program or service is unable to pay his or her monthly probation
27 programming fee.

-16-

1 probationer is financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so
2 states to the court in writing under oath, and if the court so finds
3 after a hearing.
4 (6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
5 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
6 refusal to obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's
7 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
8 payment, the court may enter an order allowing the probationer additional
9 time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking
10 the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.

12 or service shall be required to pay more than one monthly probation
13 programming fee per month. This subsection does not preclude local fees
14 as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
15 (8) The imposition of monthly probation programming fees in this
16 section shall be considered separate and apart from the fees described in
17 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262.
18 (9) The court may waive payment of the fees described in
19 subdivisions (2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262 in whole or in part if the
20 offender has been previously found to be indigent in the case for which
21 he or she is placed on probation or if after a hearing a determination is
22 made that such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the offender
23 due to limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental
24 handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time
25 that the probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program or
26 service is unable to pay his or her monthly probation programming fee.

18 custody of the juvenile. A copy of the certificate shall be forwarded to
19 the county attorney. The peace officer shall notify the juvenile's
20 parents, guardian, custodian, or relative of the juvenile's placement.

8 the next hearing, as evidenced by a demonstrable record of willful
9 failure to appear at a scheduled court hearing within the last twelve
10 months; or .

29 shall be pursued.
30 Sec. 16. (1) If a juvenile court decides to place a juvenile on
31 probation, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the
-33-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
1 juvenile should be designated as a comprehensive supervision probationer.
2 The hearing may be conducted together with the dispositional hearing or
3 following a motion to revoke probation following the procedures provided
4 in subdivision (5)(b) of section 43-286.
5 (2) The court shall designate a juvenile as a comprehensive
6 supervision probationer if the court determines that the juvenile is
7 unlikely to respond effectively to graduated response sanctions under
8 section 43-286.01, taking into account:
9 (a) The nature of the adjudication;
10 (b) The effectiveness of any past interventions or sanctions;
11 (c) The pre-disposition investigation by the probation officer; and
12 (d) The recommendation from the county attorney or city attorney,
13 including any input from law enforcement.
14 (3) Comprehensive supervision probationers shall receive prioritized
15 services that assist with early identification of needs and intensive
16 supports, such as therapeutic services, educational and vocational
17 assistance, family engagement, mentorship, and behavioral interventions.

21 adequate service delivery.
22 Sec. 17. Section 43-286.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
23 2024, is amended to read:
24 43-286.01 (1) For purposes of this section:
25 (a) Comprehensive supervision probationer means a juvenile
26 designated as such under section 16 of this act; ,
27 (b) Criminal violation means a violation of a condition of probation
28 involving commission of a misdemeanor or felony. Criminal violation does
29 not include a traffic offense; and
30 (c) Graduated graduated response means an accountability-based
31 series of sanctions, incentives, and services designed to facilitate the
-34-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
1 juvenile’s continued progress in changing behavior, ongoing compliance,
2 and successful completion of probation. Graduated response does not
3 include restrictions of liberty that would otherwise require a hearing
4 under subsection (3) of section 43-253.
5 (2)(a) (2) The Office of Probation Administration may establish a
6 statewide standardized graduated response matrix of incentives for
7 compliance and positive behaviors and sanctions for probationers who
8 violate the terms and conditions of a court order. The graduated response
9 system shall use recognized best practices and be developed with the
10 input of stakeholders, including judges, probation officers, county
11 attorneys, defense attorneys, juveniles, and parents. The office shall
12 provide implementation and ongoing training to all probation officers on
13 the graduated response options.
14 (b) (3) Graduated response sanctions should be immediate, certain,
15 consistent, and fair to appropriately address the behavior. Failure to
16 complete a sanction may result in repeating the sanction, increasing the
17 duration, or selecting a different sanction similar in nature. Continued
18 failure to comply could result in a request for a motion to revoke
19 probation. Once a sanction is successfully completed the alleged
20 probation violation is deemed resolved and cannot be alleged as a
21 violation in future proceedings.
22 (c) (4) Graduated response incentives should provide positive
23 reinforcement to encourage and support positive behavior change and
24 compliance with court-ordered conditions of probation.
25 (3)(a) Subject to subdivisions (3)(b) and (c) of this section, when
26 (5) Whenever a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
27 juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a probation officer
28 has committed a violation of the terms of the juvenile's probation while
29 on probation, but that such juvenile will not attempt to leave the
30 jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in danger, the
31 probation officer shall either:
-35-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
1 (i) (a) Impose one or more graduated response sanctions with the
2 approval of his or her chief probation officer or such chief's designee.
3 The decision to impose graduated response sanctions in lieu of formal
4 revocation proceedings rests with the probation officer and his or her
5 chief probation officer or such chief's designee and shall be based upon
6 such juvenile's risk level, the severity of the violation, and the
7 juvenile's response to the violation. If graduated response sanctions are
8 to be imposed, such juvenile shall acknowledge in writing the nature of
9 the violation and agree upon the graduated response sanction with
10 approval of such juvenile's parents or guardian. Such juvenile has the
11 right to decline to acknowledge the violation, and if he or she declines
12 to acknowledge the violation, the probation officer shall submit a
13 written report pursuant to subdivision (3)(a)(ii) (5)(b) of this section.
14 If the juvenile fails to satisfy the graduated response sanctions and the
15 office determines that a motion to revoke probation should be pursued,
16 the probation officer shall submit a written report pursuant to
17 subdivision (3)(a)(ii) (5)(b) of this section. A copy of the report shall
18 be submitted to the county attorney of the county where probation was
19 imposed; or
20 (ii) (b) Submit a written report to the county attorney of the
21 county where probation was imposed and to the juvenile’s attorney of
22 record. The report shall outline , outlining the nature of the probation
23 violation and request that formal revocation proceedings be instituted
24 against the juvenile subject to the supervision of a probation officer.
25 The report shall also include a statement regarding why graduated
26 response sanctions were not utilized or were ineffective. If there is no
27 attorney of record for the juvenile, the office shall notify the court
28 and counsel for the juvenile shall be appointed.
29 (b) For a juvenile who has been designated as a comprehensive
30 supervision probationer, graduated response sanctions under subdivision
31 (3)(a)(i) of this section may only be imposed one time. For any
-36-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
1 subsequent violations of the terms of the juvenile's probation, the
2 probation officer shall proceed as provided in subdivision (3)(a)(ii) or
3 subsection (4) of this section, as appropriate.
4 (c) When a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
5 juvenile probationer has committed a violation of the terms of the
6 juvenile's probation that is a criminal violation, the probation officer
7 shall not impose graduated response sanctions, but shall proceed as
8 provided in subdivision (3)(a)(ii) or subsection (4) of this section, as
9 appropriate.
10 (d) Whenever a graduated response sanction is imposed, the probation
11 officer shall provide the county attorney of the county where probation
12 was imposed with notice of the probation violation and the sanction.
13 (4) (6) Whenever a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe
14 that a juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a probation
15 officer has violated a condition of his or her probation and that such
16 juvenile will attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place lives or
17 property in danger, the probation officer shall take such juvenile into
18 temporary custody without a warrant and may call on any peace officer for
19 assistance as provided in section 43-248. Continued detention or
20 deprivation of liberty shall be subject to the criteria and requirements
21 of sections 43-251.01, 43-260, and 43-260.01 and subdivision (5)(b)(iv)
22 of section 43-286, and a hearing shall be held before the court within
23 twenty-four hours as provided in subsection (3) of section 43-253.
24 (5) (7) Immediately after detention or deprivation of liberty
25 pursuant to subsection (4) (6) of this section, the probation officer
26 shall notify the county attorney of the county where probation was
27 imposed and the juvenile's attorney of record and submit a written report
28 describing the risk of harm to lives or property or of fleeing the
29 jurisdiction which precipitated the need for such detention or
30 deprivation of liberty and of any violation of probation. If there is no
31 attorney of record for the juvenile, the office shall notify the court
-37-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
1 and counsel for the juvenile shall be appointed. After prompt
2 consideration of the written report, the county attorney shall:
3 (a) Order the release of the juvenile from confinement or
4 alternative to detention subject to the supervision of a probation
5 officer; or
6 (b) File with the adjudicating court a motion to revoke the
7 probation.
8 (6) (8) Whenever a county attorney receives a report from a

10 of a probation officer has violated a condition of probation and the
11 probation officer is seeking revocation of probation, the county attorney
12 may file a motion to revoke probation.
13 (7) (9) Whenever a juvenile probationer subject to supervision of a
14 probation officer is engaging in positive behavior, completion of goals,
15 and compliance with the terms of probation, the probation officer shall
16 use graduated incentives to provide positive reinforcement and
17 encouragement of such behavior. The office shall keep records of all
18 incentives and provide such records to the county attorney or the
19 juvenile’s attorney upon request.
20 (8) (10) During the term of probation, the court, on application of
21 a probation officer or of the juvenile or on its own motion, may reduce
22 or eliminate any of the conditions imposed on the juvenile. Upon
23 completion of the term of probation or the earlier discharge of the
24 juvenile, the juvenile shall be relieved of any obligations imposed by
25 the order of the court and his or her record shall be sealed pursuant to
26 section 43-2,108.04.
27 (9) (11) The probation administrator shall adopt and promulgate
28 rules and regulations to carry out this section.
29 Sec. 18. (1) At least thirty calendar days before the expiration of
30 any juvenile's term of probation, the probation officer shall send a
31 progress report to the county attorney and to the juvenile's attorney of
-38-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
1 record. The progress report shall include all court orders relating to
2 such term of probation, information on all conditions of probation, and
3 information regarding the juvenile's compliance with, or violations of,
4 such conditions.
5 (2) If the county attorney determines that revocation is
6 appropriate, the county attorney may file a motion to revoke probation.

8 juvenile shall be appointed. If such motion is filed no later than
9 fourteen calendar days before the expiration of the term of probation,
