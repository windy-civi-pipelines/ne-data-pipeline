section, a person under the age of twenty-five years who knowingly possesses a
firearm commits the offense of possession of a firearm by a prohibited juvenile
offender if he or she has previously been adjudicated an offender in juvenile
court for an act which would constitute a felony or an act which would
constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. This subsection includes
an adjudication for which a juvenile record has been sealed upon termination of
probation.
(2) Possession of a firearm by a prohibited juvenile offender is a Class
IV felony for a first offense and a Class IIIA felony for a second or
subsequent offense.
(3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to the possession of
firearms by members of the armed forces of the United States, active or
reserve, National Guard of this state, or Reserve Officers' Officers Training
Corps or peace officers or other duly authorized law enforcement officers when

the prohibition of subsection (1) of this section may file a petition for
exemption from such prohibition and thereby have his or her right to possess a
firearm reinstated. A petitioner who is younger than nineteen years of age
shall petition the juvenile court in which he or she was adjudicated for the
underlying offense. A petitioner who is nineteen years of age or older shall
petition the district court in the county in which he or she resides.
(b) In determining whether to grant a petition filed under subdivision (4)

(ii) The likelihood that the person will engage in further criminal
activity; and
(iii) Any other information the court considers relevant.
(c) The court may grant a petition filed under subdivision (4)(a) of this
section and issue an order exempting the person from the prohibition of
subsection (1) of this section when in the opinion of the court the order will
be in the best interests of the person and consistent with the public welfare.
(5) The fact that a person subject to the prohibition under subsection (1)
of this section has reached the age of twenty-five or that a court has granted
a petition under subdivision (4)(a) of this section shall not be construed to
mean that such adjudication has been set aside. Nothing in this section shall
be construed to authorize the setting aside of such an adjudication or
conviction except as otherwise provided by law.
(6) For purposes of this section, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence
has the same meaning as in section 28-1206.
Sec. 7. Section 29-2262.06, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
29-2262.06 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a
district court or county court sentences an adult offender to probation, the
court shall require the probationer to pay a one-time administrative enrollment
fee and thereafter a monthly probation programming fee.
(2) Participants in non-probation-based programs or services in which
probation personnel or probation resources are utilized pursuant to an
interlocal agreement authorized by subdivision (16) of section 29-2252 and in

probation resources are covered by funds provided pursuant to section
29-2262.07 shall pay the one-time administrative enrollment fee described in
subdivision (3)(a) of this section and the monthly probation programming fee
described in subdivision (3)(c) of this section. In addition, the provisions of
subsections (4), (7), and (11) (10) of this section applicable to probationers
apply to participants in non-probation-based programs or services. Any
participant in a non-probation-based program or service who defaults on the
payment of any such fees may, at the discretion of the court, be subject to
removal from such non-probation-based program or service. This subdivision does
-5-

LB530 LB530
2025 2025
not preclude a court or other governmental entity from charging additional
local fees for participation in such non-probation-based programs and services
or other similar non-probation-based programs and services.
(3) The court shall establish the administrative enrollment fee and
monthly probation programming fees as follows:
(a) Adult probationers placed on either probation or intensive supervision
probation and participants in non-probation-based programs or services shall
pay a one-time administrative enrollment fee of thirty dollars. The fee shall
be paid in a lump sum upon the beginning of probation supervision or
participation in a non-probation-based program or service;
(b) Adult probationers placed on probation shall pay a monthly probation
programming fee of twenty-five dollars, not later than the tenth day of each
month, for the duration of probation; and
(c) Adult probationers placed on intensive supervision probation and
participants in non-probation-based programs or services shall pay a monthly
probation programming fee of thirty-five dollars, not later than the tenth day
of each month, for the duration of probation or participation in a non-
probation-based program or service.
(4) The court shall waive payment of the monthly probation programming
fees in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that such
payment would constitute an undue hardship on the offender due to limited
income, employment or school status, or physical or mental handicap. Such
waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time that the probationer
or participant in a non-probation-based program or service is unable to pay his
or her monthly probation programming fee.
(5) If a probationer defaults in the payment of monthly probation
programming fees or any installment thereof, the court may revoke his or her
probation for nonpayment, except that probation shall not be revoked nor shall
the offender be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the probationer is
financially unable to make the payment, if he or she so states to the court in
writing under oath, and if the court so finds after a hearing.
(6) If the court determines that the default in payment described in
subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate refusal to
obey the order of the court or to failure on the probationer's part to make a
good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment, the court may enter
an order allowing the probationer additional time for payment, reducing the
amount of each installment, or revoking the fees or the unpaid portion in whole
or in part.
(7) No probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program or
service shall be required to pay more than one monthly probation programming
fee per month. This subsection does not preclude local fees as provided in
subsection (2) of this section.
(8) The imposition of monthly probation programming fees in this section
shall be considered separate and apart from the fees described in subdivisions
(2)(m) and (o) of section 29-2262.
(9) The court may waive payment of the fees described in subdivisions (2)
(m) and (o) of section 29-2262 in whole or in part if the offender has been
previously found to be indigent in the case for which he or she is placed on
probation or if after a hearing a determination is made that such payment would
constitute an undue hardship on the offender due to limited income, employment
or school status, or physical or mental handicap. Such waiver shall be in
effect only during the period of time that the probationer or participant in a
non-probation-based program or service is unable to pay his or her monthly
probation programming fee.
(10) (9) Any adult probationer received for supervision pursuant to
section 29-2637 or the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision shall
be assessed both a one-time administrative enrollment fee and monthly probation
programming fees during the period of time the probationer is actively
supervised by Nebraska probation authorities.
(11) (10) The probationer or participant in a non-probation-based program
or service shall pay the fees described in this section to the clerk of the
court. The clerk of the court shall remit all fees so collected to the State
Treasurer for credit to the Probation Program Cash Fund.
Sec. 8. Section 29-2263, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
29-2263 (1)(a) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, when
a court has sentenced an offender to probation, the court shall specify the
term of such probation which shall be not more than five years upon conviction
of a felony or second offense misdemeanor and two years upon conviction of a
first offense misdemeanor.
(b) At sentencing, the court shall provide notice to the offender that the

lives or property in danger, the probation officer shall either:
(i) (a) Impose one or more graduated response sanctions with the approval
of his or her chief probation officer or such chief's designee. The decision to
impose graduated response sanctions in lieu of formal revocation proceedings
rests with the probation officer and his or her chief probation officer or such
chief's designee and shall be based upon such juvenile's risk level, the
severity of the violation, and the juvenile's response to the violation. If
graduated response sanctions are to be imposed, such juvenile shall acknowledge

sanction with approval of such juvenile's parents or guardian. Such juvenile
has the right to decline to acknowledge the violation, and if he or she

include a statement regarding why graduated response sanctions were not
utilized or were ineffective. If there is no attorney of record for the
juvenile, the office shall notify the court and counsel for the juvenile shall
be appointed.
(b) For a juvenile who has been designated as a comprehensive supervision
probationer, graduated response sanctions under subdivision (3)(a)(i) of this
section may only be imposed one time. For any subsequent violations of the
terms of the juvenile's probation, the probation officer shall proceed as
provided in subdivision (3)(a)(ii) or subsection (4) of this section, as
appropriate.
(c) When a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
juvenile probationer has committed a violation of the terms of the juvenile's
probation that is a criminal violation, the probation officer shall not impose
graduated response sanctions, but shall proceed as provided in subdivision (3)
(a)(ii) or subsection (4) of this section, as appropriate.
(d) Whenever a graduated response sanction is imposed, the probation
officer shall provide the county attorney of the county where probation was
imposed with notice of the probation violation and the sanction.

attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place lives or property in danger,
the probation officer shall take such juvenile into temporary custody without a
warrant and may call on any peace officer for assistance as provided in section
43-248. Continued detention or deprivation of liberty shall be subject to the

attorney of record and submit a written report describing the risk of harm to
lives or property or of fleeing the jurisdiction which precipitated the need
for such detention or deprivation of liberty and of any violation of probation.
If there is no attorney of record for the juvenile, the office shall notify the
court and counsel for the juvenile shall be appointed. After prompt
consideration of the written report, the county attorney shall:
(a) Order the release of the juvenile from confinement or alternative to
detention subject to the supervision of a probation officer; or
(b) File with the adjudicating court a motion to revoke the probation.
(6) (8) Whenever a county attorney receives a report from a probation
officer that a juvenile probationer subject to the supervision of a probation
officer has violated a condition of probation and the probation officer is
seeking revocation of probation, the county attorney may file a motion to
revoke probation.
(7) (9) Whenever a juvenile probationer subject to supervision of a
probation officer is engaging in positive behavior, completion of goals, and
compliance with the terms of probation, the probation officer shall use
graduated incentives to provide positive reinforcement and encouragement of
such behavior. The office shall keep records of all incentives and provide such
records to the county attorney or the juvenile’s attorney upon request.
(8) (10) During the term of probation, the court, on application of a
probation officer or of the juvenile or on its own motion, may reduce or
eliminate any of the conditions imposed on the juvenile. Upon completion of the
