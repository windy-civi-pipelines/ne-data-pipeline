7 amended to read:
8 43-292 Subject to section 14 of this act, the The court may
9 terminate all parental rights between the parents or the mother of a

22 legal custody of the juvenile is lodged with others and such payment
23 ordered by the court;
24 (4) The parents are unfit by reason of debauchery, habitual use of
25 intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs, or repeated lewd and lascivious
