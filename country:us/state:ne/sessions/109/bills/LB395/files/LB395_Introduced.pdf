2 Supplement, 2024, is amended to read:
3 28-1204.05 (1) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this
4 section, a person under the age of twenty-five years who knowingly
5 possesses a firearm commits the offense of possession of a firearm by a
6 prohibited juvenile offender if he or she has previously been adjudicated
7 an offender in juvenile court for an act which would constitute a felony
8 or an act which would constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic
9 violence. This subsection includes an offense for which a juvenile record
10 has been sealed upon termination of probation.
11 (2) Possession of a firearm by a prohibited juvenile offender is a
12 Class IV felony for a first offense and a Class IIIA felony for a second
13 or subsequent offense.
14 (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to the possession
15 of firearms by members of the armed forces of the United States, active
16 or reserve, National Guard of this state, or Reserve Officers Training
17 Corps or peace officers or other duly authorized law enforcement officers
18 when on duty or training.
19 (4)(a) Prior to reaching the age of twenty-five years, a person
20 subject to the prohibition of subsection (1) of this section may file a
21 petition for exemption from such prohibition and thereby have his or her
22 right to possess a firearm reinstated. A petitioner who is younger than
23 nineteen years of age shall petition the juvenile court in which he or
24 she was adjudicated for the underlying offense. A petitioner who is
25 nineteen years of age or older shall petition the district court in the
26 county in which he or she resides.
27 (b) In determining whether to grant a petition filed under
28 subdivision (4)(a) of this section, the court shall consider:
29 (i) The behavior of the person after the underlying adjudication;
30 (ii) The likelihood that the person will engage in further criminal
31 activity; and
-2-

2025 2025
1 (iii) Any other information the court considers relevant.
2 (c) The court may grant a petition filed under subdivision (4)(a) of
3 this section and issue an order exempting the person from the prohibition
4 of subsection (1) of this section when in the opinion of the court the
5 order will be in the best interests of the person and consistent with the
6 public welfare.
7 (5) The fact that a person subject to the prohibition under
8 subsection (1) of this section has reached the age of twenty-five or that
9 a court has granted a petition under subdivision (4)(a) of this section
10 shall not be construed to mean that such adjudication has been set aside.
11 Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the setting aside
12 of such an adjudication or conviction except as otherwise provided by
13 law.
14 (6) For purposes of this section, misdemeanor crime of domestic
15 violence has the same meaning as in section 28-1206.
16 Sec. 2. Section 43-2,108.05, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
17 2024, is amended to read:
18 43-2,108.05 (1) If the court orders the record of a juvenile sealed,
19 the court shall:
20 (a) Order that all records, including any information or other data
21 concerning any proceedings relating to the offense, including the arrest,
22 taking into custody, petition, complaint, indictment, information, trial,
23 hearing, adjudication, correctional supervision, dismissal, or other
24 disposition or sentence, be deemed never to have occurred;
25 (b) Send notice of the order to seal the record (i) if the record
26 includes impoundment or prohibition to obtain a license or permit
27 pursuant to section 43-287, to the Department of Motor Vehicles, (ii) if
28 the juvenile whose record has been ordered sealed was a ward of the state
29 at the time the proceeding was initiated or if the Department of Health
30 and Human Services was a party in the proceeding, to such department, and

1 referenced in the court record;
2 (c) Order all notified under subdivision (1)(b) of this section to
3 seal all records pertaining to the offense;
4 (d) If the case was transferred from district court to juvenile
5 court or was transferred under section 43-282, send notice of the order
6 to seal the record to the transferring court; and
7 (e) Explain to the juvenile using developmentally appropriate
8 language what sealing the record means. The explanation shall be given
9 verbally if the juvenile is present in the court at the time the court
10 issues the sealing order and by written notice sent by regular mail to
11 the juvenile's last-known address if the juvenile is not present in the
12 court at the time the court issues the sealing order. If applicable, the
13 explanation shall inform the juvenile that the juvenile is prohibited
14 from possessing a firearm under section 28-1204.05. The sealing order
15 shall include contact information for each government agency subject to
16 the sealing order.
17 (2) The effect of having a record sealed is that thereafter no
18 person is allowed to release any information concerning such record,
19 except as provided by this section. After a record is sealed, the person
20 whose record was sealed can respond to any public inquiry as if the
21 offense resulting in such record never occurred. A government agency and
22 any other public office or agency shall reply to any public inquiry that
23 no information exists regarding a sealed record. Except as provided in
24 subsection (3) of this section, an order to seal the record applies to
25 every government agency and any other public office or agency that has a
26 record relating to the offense, regardless of whether it receives notice
27 of the hearing on the sealing of the record or a copy of the order. Upon
28 the written request of a person whose record has been sealed and the
29 presentation of a copy of such order, a government agency or any other
30 public office or agency shall seal all records pertaining to the offense.
