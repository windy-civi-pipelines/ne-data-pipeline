1 A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the restitution for redlining; to amend
2 sections 77-4310.01 and 77-4310.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of
3 Nebraska; to adopt the Restitution and Redress for Redlining Task
4 Force Act; to change provisions relating to transfers from the
5 Marijuana and Controlled Substances Tax Administration Cash Fund;
6 and to repeal the original sections.

1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 9 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Restitution and Redress for Redlining Task Force Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (1) Historical Nebraska state laws and policies show with
5 indisputable proof that in 1935 the Omaha Home Owner Loan Corporation
6 created a map that designated neighborhoods red, yellow, blue, or green,
7 with red corresponding to "high risk" and green corresponding to "low
8 risk." Mortgage lenders based the level of home loan "risk" in each
9 neighborhood on factors such as race and immigration status. The Omaha
10 Home Owner Loan Corporation map designated neighborhoods in North and
11 South Omaha as yellow and red, while neighborhoods in West Omaha are
12 designated green. Omaha Home Owner Loan Corporation staff members,
13 working with local real estate professionals, including lenders,
14 developers, and real estate appraisers, assigned grades to residential
15 neighborhoods that reflected their "mortgage security" that would then be
16 visualized on color-coded maps. Neighborhoods receiving the highest grade
17 of "A," colored green on the maps, were deemed minimal risks for banks
18 and other mortgage lenders when they were determining who should receive
19 loans and which areas in the city were safe investments. Those receiving
20 the lowest grade of "D," colored red, were considered "hazardous."
21 Conservative, responsible lenders, in Omaha Home Owner Loan Corporation
22 judgment, would "refuse to make loans in these areas or only on a
23 conservative basis." Omaha Home Owner Loan Corporation created area
24 descriptions to help to organize the data they used to assign the grades.
25 Among that information was the neighborhood's quality of housing, the
26 recent history of sale and rent values, and, crucially, the racial and
27 ethnic identity and class of residents;
28 (2) As a result of these maps beginning in 1936, the neighborhoods
29 of Omaha's Near North and South Sides were systematically segregated from
30 the rest of the city by means of prohibitive and discriminatory home
31 lending practices. In Omaha and cities across the country, red lines were
-2-

2025 2025
1 drawn on city maps by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation identifying
2 predominantly African-American and new American immigrant communities in
3 Nebraska such as: Latino and Hispanic communities, Asian communities, and
4 southern European communities, which included Russians, Poles, Czechs,
5 Germans and even Catholics as "hazardous" and "unfit for investment;"
6 (3) This discriminatory policy adopted and sanctioned by the State
7 of Nebraska was part of a pattern of national policies that practiced
8 these same prejudicial and preferential practices in cities and town
9 across the United States;
10 (4) Although Congress outlawed discriminatory lending policies in
11 the mid-twentieth century, federal policies leading up to that time
12 limited where people could live, creating geographic concentrations of
13 lower-income families and fueling suburban growth for higher-income
14 families. Official practices pertaining to zoning and mortgage lending,
15 along with restrictive covenants, impacted the shape of neighborhoods
16 across the country. The effect of those practices was illustrated through
17 federal redlining maps created by the Omaha Home Owner Loan Corporation
18 and advanced by the Federal Housing Administration. Although these
19 redlining maps conveyed reservations about lending in neighborhoods that
20 were already economically depressed, making the impact race played in
21 redlining difficult to isolate empirically, official practices outlined
22 in the Federal Housing Administration's Underwriting Manual make it clear
23 that race did indeed play a role in lending decisions;
24 (5) In spite of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which broadly
25 prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing, the red lines
26 drawn around Omaha continue to hold strong, leaving long-lasting effects
27 on communities today. Redlining denied access to financial services in
28 neighborhoods, concentrating disadvantages and resulting in higher
29 measures of social vulnerability today;
30 (6) A preponderance of scholarly, legal, and community evidentiary
31 documentation, as well as popular culture markers, constitute the basis
-3-
LB487 LB487
2025 2025
1 for inquiry into the ongoing effects of the institution of redlining and
2 its legacy of persistent systemic structures of discrimination on living
3 Nebraskans;
4 (7) Following the abolition of redlining, the State of Nebraska has
5 continued to perpetuate, condone, and often profit from practices that
6 continue to disadvantage Nebraskans including an unjust generational
7 wealth gap, unequal education, substandard housing, loss of property, and
8 decreased property values; and
9 (8) As a result of the historic and continued discrimination,
10 Nebraskans in historically redlined communities continue to suffer
11 debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships.
12 Sec. 3. It is the purpose of the Restitution and Redress for
13 Redlining Task Force Act to establish a task force that will do all of
14 the following:
15 (1) Study and develop reparation proposals for Nebraskans as a
16 result of:
17 (a) The policies and practices of redlining, against all Nebraska
18 residents that were victims of redlining and their descendants, from the
19 end of the state-sanctioned practices of redlining to the present,
20 including economic, political, educational, and social discrimination;
21 (b) The lingering negative effects of the policies and practices of
22 redlining and discrimination on living Nebraskans;
23 (c) The manner in which instructional resources and technologies are
24 being used to deny the legal, economic, educational, and societal harms
25 of redlining and the crimes against Nebraskans that lived in cities of
26 the metropolitan classes; and
27 (d) The ways in which societal institutions, public and private,
28 including higher education, corporate, religious, and associational
29 institutions benefited directly from redlining;
30 (2) Recommend appropriate ways to educate the public of the task
31 force's findings;
-4-

17 implement reform when and where necessary to make life better for
18 Nebraskans that have been discriminated against based on redlining or
19 other similar state-sanctioned measures.
20 (5) The members of the task force shall be appointed by the Governor
21 subject to confirmation by a majority of the members of the standing
22 committee of the Legislature which has subject matter jurisdiction.

11 redlining in Nebraska;
12 (2) Recommend appropriate ways to educate the public of the task

17 (a) How the recommendations comport with the current national and
18 international standards of remedies for wrongs and injuries caused by the
19 state that include restoration, restitution and redress;
20 (b) How Nebraska laws and policies continue to disproportionately
21 and negatively affect African Americans as a group and perpetuate the
22 lingering material and psychosocial effects of redlining;
