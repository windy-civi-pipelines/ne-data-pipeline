10 unlawful restriction."

12 required for recordation of a document in the land records. The amendment
13 must be recorded in the land records of each county in which the document
14 containing the unlawful restriction is recorded.
15 (c) The amendment does not affect the validity or enforceability of
16 any restriction that is not an unlawful restriction.
