2 shall be subject to such prior lien unless the gaming commission has
3 notified the lienholder in writing of the recording of such tax lien, in
4 which case the lien of any indebtedness thereafter created under such
5 mortgage or secured transaction shall be junior to the lien provided for
6 in this section.
7 (4) The lien may, within ten years from the date of filing for
8 record of the notice of lien in the office of the appropriate filing
9 officer, be extended by filing for record a continuation statement. Upon
10 timely filing of the continuation statement, the effectiveness of the
11 original notice shall be continued for ten years after the last date to
12 which the filing was effective. After such period the notice shall lapse
13 in the manner prescribed in subsection (1) of this section unless another
14 continuation statement is filed prior to such lapse.
15 (5) When a termination statement of any tax lien issued by the
16 gaming commission is filed in the office where the notice of lien is
17 filed, the appropriate filing officer shall enter such statement with the
18 date of filing in the state tax lien index where notice of the lien so
19 terminated is entered and shall file the termination statement with the
20 notice of the lien.
21 (6) The gaming commission may at any time, upon request of any party
22 involved, release from a lien all or any portion of the property subject
23 to any lien provided for in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
24 Enforcement Act or subordinate a lien to other liens and encumbrances if
25 the gaming commission determines that (a) the tax amount and any
26 interest, penalties, and additions to such tax have been paid or secured
27 sufficiently by a lien on other property, (b) the lien has become legally
28 unenforceable, (c) a surety bond or other satisfactory security has been
29 posted, deposited, or pledged with the gaming commission in an amount
30 sufficient to secure the payment of such taxes and any interest,
31 penalties, and additions to such taxes, or (d) the release, partial
-29-

2025 2025
1 release, or subordination of the lien will not jeopardize the collection
2 of such taxes and any interest, penalties, and additions to such taxes.
3 (7) A certificate by the gaming commission stating that any property
4 has been released from the lien or the lien has been subordinated to
5 other liens and encumbrances shall be conclusive evidence that the
6 property has in fact been released or the lien has been subordinated
7 pursuant to the certificate.

9 amended to read:
