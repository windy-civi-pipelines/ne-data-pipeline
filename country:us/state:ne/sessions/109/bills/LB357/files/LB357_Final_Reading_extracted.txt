2 subsequent creditor when notice of such lien and the amount due has been
3 filed by the gaming commission in the office of the Secretary of State.
4 (b) In the case of any prior mortgage on real property or secured
5 transaction covering personal property so written as to secure a present
6 debt and future advances, the lien provided in this section, when notice
7 thereof has been filed in the office of the appropriate filing officer,
8 shall be subject to such prior lien unless the gaming commission has
9 notified the lienholder in writing of the recording of such tax lien, in
10 which case the lien of any indebtedness thereafter created under such
11 mortgage or secured transaction shall be junior to the lien provided for
12 in this section.
13 (4) The lien may, within ten years from the date of filing for
14 record of the notice of lien in the office of the appropriate filing
15 officer, be extended by filing for record a continuation statement. Upon
16 timely filing of the continuation statement, the effectiveness of the
17 original notice shall be continued for ten years after the last date to
18 which the filing was effective. After such period the notice shall lapse
19 in the manner prescribed in subsection (1) of this section unless another
20 continuation statement is filed prior to such lapse.
21 (5) When a termination statement of any tax lien issued by the
22 gaming commission is filed in the office where the notice of lien is
23 filed, the appropriate filing officer shall enter such statement with the
24 date of filing in the state tax lien index where notice of the lien so
25 terminated is entered and shall file the termination statement with the
26 notice of the lien.
27 (6) The gaming commission may at any time, upon request of any party
28 involved, release from a lien all or any portion of the property subject
29 to any lien provided for in the Uniform State Tax Lien Registration and
30 Enforcement Act or subordinate a lien to other liens and encumbrances if
31 the gaming commission determines that (a) the tax amount and any
-29-

1 interest, penalties, and additions to such tax have been paid or secured
2 sufficiently by a lien on other property, (b) the lien has become legally
3 unenforceable, (c) a surety bond or other satisfactory security has been
4 posted, deposited, or pledged with the gaming commission in an amount
5 sufficient to secure the payment of such taxes and any interest,
6 penalties, and additions to such taxes, or (d) the release, partial
7 release, or subordination of the lien will not jeopardize the collection
8 of such taxes and any interest, penalties, and additions to such taxes.
9 (7) A certificate by the gaming commission stating that any property
10 has been released from the lien or the lien has been subordinated to
11 other liens and encumbrances shall be conclusive evidence that the
12 property has in fact been released or the lien has been subordinated
13 pursuant to the certificate.

15 amended to read:
