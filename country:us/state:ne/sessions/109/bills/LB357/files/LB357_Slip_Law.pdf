(1) of this section unless another continuation statement is filed prior to
such lapse.

other satisfactory security has been posted, deposited, or pledged with the
gaming commission in an amount sufficient to secure the payment of such taxes
and any interest, penalties, and additions to such taxes, or (d) the release,
partial release, or subordination of the lien will not jeopardize the
collection of such taxes and any interest, penalties, and additions to such
taxes.

been released from the lien or the lien has been subordinated to other liens
and encumbrances shall be conclusive evidence that the property has in fact
