11 including the small business corporation, under sections 77-2734.05 to
12 77-2734.15;
13 (b) If the small business corporation or limited liability company

4 executed agreement being attached to the Nebraska return, the corporation
5 or limited liability company shall remit with the return an amount equal

7 77-2715.02 multiplied by the nonresident shareholder's or member's share
8 of the corporation's or limited liability company's income which was
9 derived from or attributable to this state. For taxable years beginning
10 or deemed to begin on or after January 1, 2013, in the absence of the

1 shall be filed if the small business corporation or limited liability
2 company has income derived from Nebraska sources.
3 (8) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
4 (a) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January
5 1, 2018, a small business corporation may annually make an irrevocable

8 such return. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, such
9 election may be made on the applicable income tax return and shall must
10 be made on or before the due date for filing the applicable income tax
11 return, including any extensions that have been granted;
12 (b) An electing small business corporation with respect to a taxable
13 period shall pay an income tax equivalent to the highest individual
14 income tax rate provided in section 77-2715.03 multiplied by the electing

16 this state in accordance with the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, for such
17 taxable period;
18 (c) An electing small business corporation shall be treated as a

20 payments of estimated tax. The requirement for payment of estimated tax
21 under section 77-2769 shall not apply for tax years beginning prior to
22 January 1, 2024. Payments of estimated tax made by an eligible small
23 business corporation that does not make an election under this subsection
24 shall be treated as income tax withholding on behalf of the shareholders;
25 (d) Except as provided in subdivision (e) of this subsection, the
26 shareholders of an electing small business corporation shall must file a
27 Nebraska return to report their pro rata or distributive share of the

1 amount of Nebraska income tax imposed under the Nebraska Revenue Act of
2 1967 and deducted by the electing small business corporation for federal
3 income tax purposes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code;
4 (e) A nonresident individual who is a shareholder of an electing
5 small business corporation shall not be required to file a Nebraska tax
6 return for a taxable year if, for such taxable year, the only source of
7 income derived from or connected with sources within this state for such
8 shareholder, or for the shareholder and the shareholder's spouse if a
9 joint federal income tax return is filed, is from one or more electing
10 small business corporations or electing partnerships as defined in
11 subdivision (7)(a) of section 77-2727 for such taxable year and such
12 nonresident individual shareholder's tax under the Nebraska Revenue Act
13 of 1967 would be fully satisfied by the credit allowed to such
14 shareholder under subdivision (g) of this subsection;
15 (f) If the amount calculated under subdivision (a) of this
16 subsection results in a net operating loss, such net operating loss may
17 not be carried forward to succeeding taxable years;
18 (g) A refundable credit shall be available to the shareholders in an
19 amount equal to their pro rata or distributive share of the Nebraska
20 income tax paid by the electing small business corporation. For tax
21 returns filed for taxable years beginning or deemed to begin on or after
22 January 1, 2022, such credit shall be allowed for the same taxable year
23 for which the election is made, without regard to the year in which the
24 tax is paid to Nebraska or deducted on a federal income tax return; and
25 (h)(i) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after
26 January 1, 2018, but prior to January 1, 2023, the electing small
27 business corporation shall must make the election under this subsection
28 on or after January 1, 2023, but before December 31, 2025, in the form

1 manner, which shall not include any changes to the past returns other
2 than those that are directly related to the election under this
3 subsection.
4 (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if an electing
5 small business corporation files in the form and manner as specified in
6 subdivision (h)(i) of this subsection, the deadline for filing a claim
7 for credit or refund prescribed in section 77-2793 shall be extended for
8 affected shareholders of the electing small business corporation until
9 the timeframe specified in section 77-2793 or January 31, 2026, whichever
10 is later. The resulting claim of refund for tax years beginning prior to
11 January 1, 2023, shall be submitted in the form and manner as prescribed
12 by the Tax Commissioner. Neither the electing small business corporation
13 nor its shareholders shall incur any penalties for late filing nor owe
14 interest on such amounts. The Tax Commissioner shall not be required to
15 pay interest on any amounts owed to the shareholders resulting from such
16 refund claims.
17 (iii) Notwithstanding the dates provided in subdivision (h)(i) of
18 this subsection, the Tax Commissioner shall have one year from the date
19 an electing small business corporation files in the form and manner as
20 specified in subdivision (h)(i) of this subsection to review and make a
21 written proposed deficiency determination in accordance with section
22 77-2786. Any notice of deficiency determination made as specified in this
23 subdivision may be enforced at any time within six years from the date of

27 taxable period, an eligible small business corporation having an election
28 in effect under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code that has made

2 regulations thereunder.
3 (10) For purposes of this section, any shareholder or member of the
4 corporation or limited liability company that is a grantor trust of a

6 the nonresident grantor was the shareholder or member.
7 Sec. 33. Section 77-2776, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
8 2024, is amended to read:

11 amount of tax. If the Tax Commissioner finds that the amount of tax shown
12 on the return is less than the correct amount, he or she shall notify the
13 taxpayer of the amount of the deficiency proposed to be assessed. If the
14 Tax Commissioner finds that the tax paid is more than the correct amount,
15 he or she shall credit the overpayment against any taxes due by the
16 taxpayer and refund the difference. The Tax Commissioner shall, upon
17 request, make prompt assessment of taxes due as provided by the laws of
18 the United States for federal income tax purposes.

22 be assessed as in the case of a deficiency.
23 (3) A notice of deficiency shall set forth the reason for the

25 be carried over to another year. The notice shall include a written
26 statement containing the details of the facts, circumstances, and reasons
27 the Tax Commissioner used to determine that the taxpayer did not report
28 the correct amount of tax. The notice may be mailed to the taxpayer at
29 his or her last-known address. In the case of a joint return, the notice
30 of deficiency may be a single joint notice, except that if the Tax
31 Commissioner is notified by either spouse that separate residences have

2 spouse. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice
3 of deficiency may be mailed to his or her last-known address unless the
4 Tax Commissioner has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary
5 relationship with respect to such taxpayer.
6 (4) A notice of deficiency regarding an item of entity income may be
7 mailed to the entity at its last-known address or to the address of the
8 entity's tax matters person for federal income tax purposes. Such notice
9 shall be deemed to have been received by each partner, shareholder, or
10 member of such entity, but only for items of entity income reported by
11 the partner, shareholder, or member. The actions taken thereon on behalf
12 of the partnership, limited liability company, small business

1 statements. Property tax credits granted under the act shall be credited
2 against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts.
3 (2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each
4 parcel, the county treasurer shall multiply the amount disbursed to the
5 county under subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school
6 district taxes levied in the current prior year on the parcel to the
7 school district taxes levied in the current prior year on all real
8 property in the county. The amount so determined shall be the property
9 tax credit for that parcel.
10 (3) If the real property owner qualifies for a homestead exemption
11 under sections 77-3501 to 77-3529, the owner shall also be qualified for
12 the property tax credit provided in this section to the extent of any
13 remaining liability after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the
14 property tax credit provided in this section results in a property tax
15 liability on the homestead that is less than zero, the amount of the
16 credit which cannot be used by the taxpayer shall be returned to the
17 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
18 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall

23 Tax Commissioner, indicating the amount of funds distributed to each
24 school district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the
25 amount of unused credits returned.
26 (4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be
27 equal to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of
28 this section multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
29 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
30 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
31 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year

2 be disbursed under this subsection to each county and shall certify such
3 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
4 the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on or before
5 January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
6 (5) After retaining one percent of the amount The county treasurer
7 shall disburse amounts received under subsection (4) of this section for
8 costs, the county treasurer shall disburse the remaining funds, which are
9 credited against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts,
10 in the same manner as if such funds had been received in the form of
11 property tax payments for property taxes owed to school districts,
12 meaning any amounts attributable to divided taxes pursuant to section
13 18-2147 of the Community Development Law shall be remitted to the
14 applicable authority for which such taxes were divided.
15 (6) The School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund shall be
16 used for purposes of making the disbursements to counties required under
17 subsection (4) of this section.
