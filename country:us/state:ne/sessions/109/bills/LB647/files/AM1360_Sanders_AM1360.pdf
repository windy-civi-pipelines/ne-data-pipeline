1 (f) of section 77-202 for any real or tangible personal property, except
2 real property used for cemetery purposes, shall apply for exemption to
3 the county assessor on or before December 31 of the year preceding the
4 year for which the exemption is sought on forms prescribed by the Tax
5 Commissioner. Applications that lack an estimated valuation, or any other
6 required information, shall result in the denial of the requested
7 exemption. The county assessor shall examine the application and
8 recommend either taxable or exempt for the real property or tangible
9 personal property to the county board of equalization on or before March
10 1 following. For applications involving property described in subdivision
11 (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202, the county assessor shall also
12 calculate the exemption amount for the property and shall submit such
13 calculation to the county board of equalization along with his or her
14 recommendations. Notice that a list of the applications from

1 77-202, and shall assess a penalty against the property of ten percent of
2 the tax that would have been assessed had the waiver been denied or one
3 hundred dollars, whichever is less, for each calendar month or fraction
4 thereof for which the filing of the exemption application missed the
5 December 31 deadline. The penalty shall be collected and distributed in
6 the same manner as a tax on the property and interest shall be assessed
7 at the rate specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to
8 time be adjusted by the Legislature, from the date the tax would have
9 been delinquent until paid. The penalty shall also become a lien in the
10 same manner as a tax pursuant to section 77-203.
11 Sec. 28. Section 77-202.03, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
12 2024, is amended to read:
13 77-202.03 (1) Except as provided in section 77-202.10 and subsection
14 (2) of this section, a properly granted exemption of real or tangible
15 personal property provided for in subdivisions (1)(c) and (d) of section
16 77-202 shall continue for a period of four years if the statement of
17 reaffirmation of exemption required by subsection (3) of this section is
18 filed when due. The four-year period shall begin with years evenly
19 divisible by four. A properly granted exemption of real property provided
20 for in subdivision (1)(f) of section 77-202 shall continue for the period
21 described in section 4 of this act without the need to file any statement
22 of reaffirmation of exemption under subsection (3) of this section.
23 (2) An owner of property which has been granted an exemption under
24 subdivision (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202 shall be required to
25 reapply for the exemption each year so that the exemption amount for the
26 year can be recalculated.

29 under subdivision (1)(c) or (d) of section 77-202 for the real or
30 tangible personal property, except real property used for cemetery

1 of section 77-202, shall file a statement of reaffirmation of exemption
2 with the county assessor on or before December 31 of the year preceding
3 the year for which the exemption is sought, on forms prescribed by the
4 Tax Commissioner, certifying that the ownership and use of the exempted
5 property has not changed during the year. Any organization or society
6 which misses the December 31 deadline for filing the statement of
7 reaffirmation of exemption may file the statement of reaffirmation of
8 exemption by June 30. Such filing shall maintain the tax-exempt status of
9 the property without further action by the county and regardless of any
10 previous action by the county board of equalization to deny the exemption
11 due to late filing of the statement of reaffirmation of exemption. Upon
12 any such late filing, the county assessor shall assess a penalty against
13 the property of ten percent of the tax that would have been assessed had
14 the statement of reaffirmation of exemption not been filed or one hundred
15 dollars, whichever is less, for each calendar month or fraction thereof
16 for which the filing of the statement of reaffirmation of exemption is
17 late. The penalty shall be collected and distributed in the same manner
18 as a tax on the property and interest shall be assessed at the rate
19 specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be
20 adjusted by the Legislature, from the date the tax would have been
21 delinquent until paid. The penalty shall also become a lien in the same
22 manner as a tax pursuant to section 77-203.
23 (4)(a) If any organization, or society, or taxpayer seeks a tax
24 exemption under subdivision (1)(c), (d), or (f) of section 77-202 for any
25 real or tangible personal property acquired on or after January 1 of any
26 year or converted to exempt use on or after January 1 of any year, the
27 organization, or society, or taxpayer shall make application for
28 exemption on or before July 1 of that year as provided in subsection (1)
29 of section 77-202.01. The procedure for reviewing the application shall
30 be as in sections 77-202.01 to 77-202.05, except that the exempt use
31 shall be determined as of the date of application and the review by the

1 county board of equalization shall be completed by August 15.
2 (b) If an organization as described in subdivision (1)(c) or (d) of
3 section 77-202 purchases, between July 1 and the levy date, property that
4 has been granted tax exemption and the property continues to be qualified
5 for a property tax exemption, the purchaser shall on or before November
6 15 make application for exemption as provided in section 77-202.01. The
7 procedure for reviewing the application shall be as in sections 77-202.01
8 to 77-202.05, and the review by the county board of equalization shall be
9 completed by December 15.
10 (c) If a taxpayer purchases, between July 1 and the levy date,
11 property described in subdivision (1)(f) of section 77-202 that has been
12 granted tax exemption and the property continues to be qualified for a
13 property tax exemption, the purchaser shall on or before November 15 make
14 application for exemption as provided in section 77-202.01. The procedure
15 for reviewing the application shall be as in sections 77-202.01 to
16 77-202.05, and the review by the county board of equalization shall be
17 completed by December 15.
18 (5) In any year, the county assessor or the county board of
19 equalization may cause a review of any exemption to determine whether the
20 exemption is proper. Such a review may be taken even if the ownership or
21 use of the property has not changed from the date of the allowance of the
22 exemption. If it is determined that a change in an exemption is
23 warranted, the procedure for hearing set out in section 77-202.02 shall
24 be followed, except that the published notice shall state that the list
25 provided in the county assessor's office only includes those properties
26 being reviewed. If an exemption is denied, the county board of
27 equalization shall place the property on the tax rolls retroactive to
28 January 1 of that year if on the date of the decision of the county board
29 of equalization the property no longer qualifies for an exemption.
30 The county board of equalization shall give notice of the assessed
31 value of the real property in the same manner as outlined in section
-8-

1 77-1507, and the procedures for filing a protest shall be the same as
2 those in section 77-1502.
3 When personal property which was exempt becomes taxable because of
4 lost exemption status, the owner or his or her agent has thirty days
5 after the date of denial to file a personal property return with the
6 county assessor. Upon the expiration of the thirty days for filing a
7 personal property return pursuant to this subsection, the county assessor
8 shall proceed to list and value the personal property and apply the
9 penalty pursuant to section 77-1233.04.
10 (6) During the month of September of each year, the county board of
11 equalization shall cause to be published in a paper of general
12 circulation in the county a list of all real estate in the county exempt
13 from taxation for that year pursuant to subdivisions (1)(c), and (d), and
14 (f) of section 77-202. Such list shall be grouped into categories as
15 provided by the Property Tax Administrator. An electronic copy of the
16 list of real property exemptions and a copy of the proof of publication
17 shall be forwarded to the Property Tax Administrator on or before
18 November 1 of each year.
19 Sec. 29. Section 77-202.05, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
20 2024, is amended to read:
