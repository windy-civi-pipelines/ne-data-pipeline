application and recommend either taxable or exempt for the real property or
tangible personal property to the county board of equalization on or before
March 1 following. For applications involving property described in subdivision
(1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202, the county assessor shall also calculate
the exemption amount for the property and shall submit such calculation to the
county board of equalization along with his or her recommendations. Notice that

that the county assessor may consider the application for exemption. The county
board of equalization shall grant the waiver upon a finding that good cause
exists for the failure to make application on or before December 31. When the
waiver is granted, the county assessor shall examine the application and
recommend either taxable or exempt for the real property or tangible personal
property to the county board of equalization, shall calculate the exemption
amount for any property described in subdivision (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section

tax that would have been assessed had the waiver been denied or one hundred
dollars, whichever is less, for each calendar month or fraction thereof for
which the filing of the exemption application missed the December 31 deadline.
The penalty shall be collected and distributed in the same manner as a tax on
the property and interest shall be assessed at the rate specified in section
45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted by the Legislature,
from the date the tax would have been delinquent until paid. The penalty shall
also become a lien in the same manner as a tax pursuant to section 77-203.

of this section, a properly granted exemption of real or tangible personal
property provided for in subdivisions (1)(c) and (d) of section 77-202 shall
continue for a period of four years if the statement of reaffirmation of
exemption required by subsection (3) of this section is filed when due. The
four-year period shall begin with years evenly divisible by four. A properly
granted exemption of real property provided for in subdivision (1)(f) of

Section 22:
section 77-202 shall continue for the period described in section 4 of this act
without the need to file any statement of reaffirmation of exemption under
subsection (3) of this section.

subdivision (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202 shall be required to reapply
for the exemption each year so that the exemption amount for the year can be
recalculated.
(3) In each intervening year occurring between application years, the
organization or society which filed the granted exemption application under
subdivision (1)(c) or (d) of section 77-202 for the real or tangible personal
property, except real property used for cemetery purposes and real property
described in subdivision (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202, shall file a
statement of reaffirmation of exemption with the county assessor on or before
December 31 of the year preceding the year for which the exemption is sought,
on forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, certifying that the ownership and
use of the exempted property has not changed during the year. Any organization
or society which misses the December 31 deadline for filing the statement of
reaffirmation of exemption may file the statement of reaffirmation of exemption
by June 30. Such filing shall maintain the tax-exempt status of the property
without further action by the county and regardless of any previous action by
the county board of equalization to deny the exemption due to late filing of
the statement of reaffirmation of exemption. Upon any such late filing, the
county assessor shall assess a penalty against the property of ten percent of
the tax that would have been assessed had the statement of reaffirmation of
exemption not been filed or one hundred dollars, whichever is less, for each
calendar month or fraction thereof for which the filing of the statement of
-12-
LB647 LB647
2025 2025
reaffirmation of exemption is late. The penalty shall be collected and
distributed in the same manner as a tax on the property and interest shall be
assessed at the rate specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time
to time be adjusted by the Legislature, from the date the tax would have been
delinquent until paid. The penalty shall also become a lien in the same manner
as a tax pursuant to section 77-203.

tangible personal property acquired on or after January 1 of any year or
converted to exempt use on or after January 1 of any year, the organization, or
society, or taxpayer shall make application for exemption on or before July 1
of that year as provided in subsection (1) of section 77-202.01. The procedure
for reviewing the application shall be as in sections 77-202.01 to 77-202.05,
except that the exempt use shall be determined as of the date of application
and the review by the county board of equalization shall be completed by August

Section 23:
15.
(b) If an organization as described in subdivision (1)(c) or (d) of

Section 24:
section 77-202 purchases, between July 1 and the levy date, property that has
been granted tax exemption and the property continues to be qualified for a
property tax exemption, the purchaser shall on or before November 15 make
application for exemption as provided in section 77-202.01. The procedure for
reviewing the application shall be as in sections 77-202.01 to 77-202.05, and
the review by the county board of equalization shall be completed by December

exemption and the property continues to be qualified for a property tax
exemption, the purchaser shall on or before November 15 make application for
exemption as provided in section 77-202.01. The procedure for reviewing the
application shall be as in sections 77-202.01 to 77-202.05, and the review by
the county board of equalization shall be completed by December 15.
(5) In any year, the county assessor or the county board of equalization
may cause a review of any exemption to determine whether the exemption is
proper. Such a review may be taken even if the ownership or use of the property
has not changed from the date of the allowance of the exemption. If it is
determined that a change in an exemption is warranted, the procedure for
hearing set out in section 77-202.02 shall be followed, except that the
published notice shall state that the list provided in the county assessor's
office only includes those properties being reviewed. If an exemption is
denied, the county board of equalization shall place the property on the tax
rolls retroactive to January 1 of that year if on the date of the decision of
the county board of equalization the property no longer qualifies for an
exemption.
The county board of equalization shall give notice of the assessed value
of the real property in the same manner as outlined in section 77-1507, and the
procedures for filing a protest shall be the same as those in section 77-1502.
When personal property which was exempt becomes taxable because of lost
exemption status, the owner or his or her agent has thirty days after the date
of denial to file a personal property return with the county assessor. Upon the
expiration of the thirty days for filing a personal property return pursuant to
this subsection, the county assessor shall proceed to list and value the
personal property and apply the penalty pursuant to section 77-1233.04.

equalization shall cause to be published in a paper of general circulation in

this section. For a nonresident individual, estate, or trust or for a partial-
year resident individual, the net operating loss computed on the federal return

for groups of foreign countries. The portion of the taxes that may be deducted
shall be computed in the following manner:
(a) The amount of federal taxable income from operations within a foreign
taxing jurisdiction shall be reduced by the amount of taxes actually paid to
the foreign jurisdiction that are not deductible solely because the foreign tax
credit was elected on the federal income tax return;
(b) The amount of after-tax income shall be divided by one minus the
maximum tax rate for corporations in the Internal Revenue Code; and

77-2727 (1) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section and
subsection (5) of section 77-2775, a partnership as such shall not be subject
to the income tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Persons or their
authorized representatives carrying on business as partners shall be liable for
the income tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 only in their
separate or individual capacities.
(2) The partners of such partnership who are residents of this state or
corporations shall include in their incomes their proportionate share of such
partnership's income.
(3) If any partner of such partnership is a nonresident individual during
any part of the partnership's reporting year, he or she shall file a Nebraska
income tax return which shall include in Nebraska adjusted gross income that
portion of the partnership's Nebraska income, as determined under the
provisions of sections 77-2728 and 77-2729, allocable to his or her interest in
the partnership and shall execute and forward to the partnership, on or before
the original due date of the Nebraska partnership return, an agreement which
states that he or she will file a Nebraska income tax return and pay income tax
on all income derived from or attributable to sources in this state, and such
agreement shall be attached to the partnership's Nebraska return for such
reporting year.
(4)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this subsection, in the
absence of the nonresident individual partner's executed agreement being
attached to the Nebraska partnership return, the partnership shall remit a
portion of such partner's income which was derived from or attributable to
Nebraska sources with its Nebraska return for the reporting year. For tax years
beginning or deemed to begin before January 1, 2013, the amount of remittance,
in such instance, shall be the highest individual income tax rate determined
under section 77-2715.02 multiplied by the nonresident individual partner's
share of the partnership income which was derived from or attributable to
sources within this state. For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or
after January 1, 2013, the amount of remittance, in such instance, shall be the
highest individual income tax rate determined under section 77-2715.03
multiplied by the nonresident individual partner's share of the partnership
income which was derived from or attributable to sources within this state.
(b) Any amount remitted on behalf of any partner shall be allowed as a
credit against the Nebraska income tax liability of the partner.
(c) Subdivision (a) of this subsection does not apply to a publicly traded
partnership as defined by section 7704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, that is treated as a partnership for the purposes of the code and
that has agreed to file an annual information return with the Department of
Revenue reporting the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and other
information requested by the department of each unit holder with an income in
the state in excess of five hundred dollars.
(5) The Tax Commissioner may allow a nonresident individual partner to not
file a Nebraska income tax return if the nonresident individual partner's only
source of Nebraska income was his or her share of the partnership's income
which was derived from or attributable to sources within this state, the
-21-
LB647 LB647
2025 2025
nonresident did not file an agreement to file a Nebraska income tax return, and
the partnership has remitted the amount required by subsection (4) of this

Section 34:
section on behalf of such nonresident individual partner. The amount remitted
shall be retained in satisfaction of the Nebraska income tax liability of the
nonresident individual partner.
(6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
(a) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2018, a partnership may annually make an irrevocable election to pay the taxes,
interest, or penalties levied by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 at the entity
level for the taxable period covered by such return. For tax years beginning on
or after January 1, 2023, such election may be made on the applicable income
tax return and shall must be made on or before the due date for filing the
applicable income tax return, including any extensions that have been granted;
(b) An electing partnership with respect to a taxable period shall pay an
income tax equivalent to the highest individual income tax rate provided in

Section 35:
section 77-2715.03 multiplied by the electing partnership's net income as
apportioned or allocated to this state in accordance with the Nebraska Revenue
Act of 1967, for such taxable period;
(c) An electing partnership shall be treated as a corporation with respect
to the requirements of section 77-2769 for payments of estimated tax. The
requirement for payment of estimated tax under section 77-2769 shall not apply
for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2024. Payments of estimated tax
made by an eligible partnership that does not make an election under this
subsection shall be treated as income tax withholding on behalf of the
partners;
(d) Except as provided in subdivision (e) of this subsection, the partners
of an electing partnership shall must file a Nebraska return to report their
pro rata or distributive share of the income of the electing partnership in
accordance with the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, as applicable. In determining
the sum of its pro rata or distributive share and computing the tax under this
subsection, an electing partnership shall add back any amount of Nebraska
income tax imposed under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and deducted by the
electing partnership for federal income tax purposes under section 164 of the
Internal Revenue Code;
(e) A nonresident individual who is a partner of an electing partnership
shall not be required to file a Nebraska tax return for a taxable year if, for
such taxable year, the only source of income derived from or connected with
sources within this state for such partner, or for the partner and the
partner's spouse if a joint federal income tax return is filed, is from one or
more electing partnerships or electing small business corporations as defined
in subdivision (9)(a) of section 77-2734.01 for such taxable year and such
nonresident individual partner's tax under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967
would be fully satisfied by the credit allowed to such partner under
subdivision (g) of this subsection;
(f) If the amount calculated under subdivision (a) of this subsection
results in a net operating loss, such net operating loss may not be carried
forward to succeeding taxable years;
(g)(i) A refundable credit shall be available to the partners in an amount
equal to their pro rata or distributive share of the Nebraska income tax paid
by the electing partnership. For tax returns filed for taxable years beginning
or deemed to begin on or after January 1, 2022, such credit shall be allowed
for the same taxable year for which the election is made, without regard to the
year in which the tax is paid to Nebraska or deducted on a federal income tax
return;
(ii) In the case of a partnership or small business corporation that is a
partner of an electing partnership, the refundable credit under this
subdivision (g) shall (A) be allowed to its partners or shareholders in
accordance with the determination of income and distributive share of the
Nebraska income tax paid by the electing partnership or (B) be applied against
the partner's tax, interest, and penalty. Any excess credit deemed an
overpayment may be refunded or applied to the subsequent tax year;
(iii) If a partnership making the election under this subsection is a
partner of another electing partnership, net income shall be computed as
provided in subsection (1) of this section. The upper tier electing partnership
shall claim a credit for the tax paid by the lower tier electing partnership.
The upper tier electing partnership shall distribute out the pro rata or
distributive share of the credits to its partners for tax paid under this
subsection by all tiers of electing partnerships. As used in this subdivision,
the term lower tier electing partnership means an electing partnership in which
some or all of the partners are an electing partnership. The term upper tier
electing partnership means an electing partnership that is a partner of a lower
tier electing partnership. An electing partnership may have two or more tiers;
and
(h)(i) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2018, but prior to January 1, 2023, the electing partnership shall must make
the election under this subsection on or after January 1, 2023, but before
December 31, 2025, in the form and manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner
for all years for which the election under this subsection is made on behalf of
the electing partnership. The Tax Commissioner shall establish the form and
manner, which shall not include any changes to the past returns other than
those that are directly related to the election under this subsection.
(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if an electing
partnership files in the form and manner as specified in subdivision (h)(i) of
-22-
LB647 LB647
2025 2025
this subsection, the deadline for filing a claim for credit or refund
prescribed in section 77-2793 shall be extended for affected partners of the
electing partnership until the timeframe specified in section 77-2793 or
January 31, 2026, whichever is later. The resulting claim of refund for tax
years beginning prior to January 1, 2023, shall be submitted in the form and
manner as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Neither the electing partnership
nor its partners shall incur any penalties for late filing nor owe interest on
such amounts. The Tax Commissioner shall not be required to pay interest on any
amounts owed to the partners resulting from such refund claims.
(iii) Notwithstanding the dates provided in subdivision (h)(i) of this
subsection, the Tax Commissioner shall have one year from the date an electing
partnership files in the form and manner as specified in subdivision (h)(i) of
this subsection to review and make a written proposed deficiency determination
in accordance with section 77-2786. Any notice of deficiency determination made
as specified in this subdivision may be enforced at any time within six years
from the date of the notice of deficiency determination.
(7) For purposes of this section:
(a) Electing partnership means, with respect to a taxable period, an
eligible partnership that has made an election pursuant to subsection (6) of
this section with respect to such taxable period; and
(b) Eligible partnership means any partnership as provided for in section
7701(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code that has a filing requirement under the
Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 other than a publicly traded partnership as
defined in section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. An eligible partnership
includes any entity, including a limited liability company, treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes that otherwise meets the
requirements of this subdivision.
(8) For purposes of this section, any partner that is a grantor trust of a
nonresident shall be disregarded and this section shall apply as though the
nonresident grantor was the partner.
Sec. 37. Section 77-2734.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
77-2734.01 (1) Residents of Nebraska who are shareholders of a small
business corporation having an election in effect under subchapter S of the

organized pursuant to the Nebraska Uniform Limited Liability Company Act shall
include in their Nebraska taxable income, to the extent includable in federal
gross income, their proportionate share of such corporation's or limited
liability company's federal income adjusted pursuant to this section. Income or
loss from such corporation or limited liability company conducting a business,
trade, profession, or occupation shall be included in the Nebraska taxable

state. For taxable years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,

agreement being attached to the Nebraska return, the corporation or limited
liability company shall remit with the return an amount equal to the highest
individual income tax rate determined under section 77-2715.03 multiplied by

state. The amount remitted shall be allowed as a credit against the Nebraska
income tax liability of the shareholder or member.
(6) The Tax Commissioner may allow a nonresident individual shareholder or
member to not file a Nebraska income tax return if the nonresident individual
shareholder's or member's only source of Nebraska income was his or her share
of the small business corporation's or limited liability company's income which
was derived from or attributable to sources within this state, the nonresident
did not file an agreement to file a Nebraska income tax return, and the small
business corporation or limited liability company has remitted the amount
required by subsection (5) of this section on behalf of such nonresident
individual shareholder or member. The amount remitted shall be retained in
satisfaction of the Nebraska income tax liability of the nonresident individual
shareholder or member.
(7) A small business corporation or limited liability company return shall
be filed if the small business corporation or limited liability company has

corporation with respect to the requirements of section 77-2769 for payments of

77-2769 shall not apply for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2024.
Payments of estimated tax made by an eligible small business corporation that

withholding on behalf of the shareholders;
(d) Except as provided in subdivision (e) of this subsection, the
shareholders of an electing small business corporation shall must file a
Nebraska return to report their pro rata or distributive share of the income of
the electing small business corporation in accordance with the Nebraska Revenue

distributive share and computing the tax under this subsection, an electing
small business corporation shall add back any amount of Nebraska income tax
imposed under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and deducted by the electing
small business corporation for federal income tax purposes under section 164 of

business corporation shall not be required to file a Nebraska tax return for a

shareholder and the shareholder's spouse if a joint federal income tax return
is filed, is from one or more electing small business corporations or electing
partnerships as defined in subdivision (7)(a) of section 77-2727 for such
taxable year and such nonresident individual shareholder's tax under the
Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 would be fully satisfied by the credit allowed to
such shareholder under subdivision (g) of this subsection;
(f) If the amount calculated under subdivision (a) of this subsection
results in a net operating loss, such net operating loss may not be carried
forward to succeeding taxable years;

paid by the electing small business corporation. For tax returns filed for
taxable years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1, 2022, such
credit shall be allowed for the same taxable year for which the election is
made, without regard to the year in which the tax is paid to Nebraska or
deducted on a federal income tax return; and
(h)(i) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2018, but prior to January 1, 2023, the electing small business corporation

the electing small business corporation until the timeframe specified in

refund for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2023, shall be submitted in
the form and manner as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Neither the electing
small business corporation nor its shareholders shall incur any penalties for
late filing nor owe interest on such amounts. The Tax Commissioner shall not be
required to pay interest on any amounts owed to the shareholders resulting from
such refund claims.
(iii) Notwithstanding the dates provided in subdivision (h)(i) of this
subsection, the Tax Commissioner shall have one year from the date an electing
small business corporation files in the form and manner as specified in
subdivision (h)(i) of this subsection to review and make a written proposed
deficiency determination in accordance with section 77-2786. Any notice of
deficiency determination made as specified in this subdivision may be enforced
at any time within six years from the date of the notice of deficiency
determination.

details of the facts, circumstances, and reasons the Tax Commissioner used to
determine that the taxpayer did not report the correct amount of tax. The
notice may be mailed to the taxpayer at his or her last-known address. In the
case of a joint return, the notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice,
except that if the Tax Commissioner is notified by either spouse that separate
residences have been established, the Tax Commissioner shall mail joint notices
to each spouse. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a
notice of deficiency may be mailed to his or her last-known address unless the

subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
in the current prior year on the parcel to the school district taxes levied in
the current prior year on all real property in the county. The amount so

September 15 of each year thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount to be disbursed under this subsection to each county and

higher education funding and the continued operation and maintenance of the

creation of the means of encouragement for persons to invest in such a program
represents the carrying out of a vital and valid public purpose. In order to

exemption provided in subdivision subdivisions (1)(c), and (d), or (f) of
section 77-202 for any real or tangible personal property, except real property
used for cemetery purposes, shall apply for exemption to the county assessor on
or before December 31 of the year preceding the year for which the exemption is
sought on forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Applications that lack an
estimated valuation, or any other required information, shall result in the
denial of the requested exemption. The county assessor shall examine the
application and recommend either taxable or exempt for the real property or
tangible personal property to the county board of equalization on or before
March 1 following. For applications involving property described in subdivision
(1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202, the county assessor shall also calculate
the exemption amount for the property and shall submit such calculation to the
county board of equalization along with his or her recommendations. Notice that
a list of the applications from organizations, societies, and taxpayers seeking
tax exemption, descriptions of the property, and recommendations of the county
assessor are available in the county assessor's office shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county at least ten days prior to
consideration of any application by the county board of equalization.
(2) Any organization, or society, or taxpayer which fails to file an
exemption application on or before December 31 may apply on or before June 30
to the county assessor. The organization, or society, or taxpayer shall also
file in writing a request with the county board of equalization for a waiver so
that the county assessor may consider the application for exemption. The county
board of equalization shall grant the waiver upon a finding that good cause
exists for the failure to make application on or before December 31. When the
waiver is granted, the county assessor shall examine the application and
recommend either taxable or exempt for the real property or tangible personal
property to the county board of equalization, shall calculate the exemption
amount for any property described in subdivision (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section
77-202, and shall assess a penalty against the property of ten percent of the
tax that would have been assessed had the waiver been denied or one hundred
dollars, whichever is less, for each calendar month or fraction thereof for
which the filing of the exemption application missed the December 31 deadline.
The penalty shall be collected and distributed in the same manner as a tax on
the property and interest shall be assessed at the rate specified in section
45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted by the Legislature,
from the date the tax would have been delinquent until paid. The penalty shall
also become a lien in the same manner as a tax pursuant to section 77-203.

of this section, a properly granted exemption of real or tangible personal
property provided for in subdivisions (1)(c) and (d) of section 77-202 shall
continue for a period of four years if the statement of reaffirmation of
exemption required by subsection (3) of this section is filed when due. The
four-year period shall begin with years evenly divisible by four. A properly
granted exemption of real property provided for in subdivision (1)(f) of
section 77-202 shall continue for the period described in section 4 of this act
without the need to file any statement of reaffirmation of exemption under
subsection (3) of this section.

subdivision (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202 shall be required to reapply
for the exemption each year so that the exemption amount for the year can be
recalculated.
(3) In each intervening year occurring between application years, the
organization or society which filed the granted exemption application under
subdivision (1)(c) or (d) of section 77-202 for the real or tangible personal
property, except real property used for cemetery purposes and real property
described in subdivision (1)(d)(iii) or (iv) of section 77-202, shall file a
statement of reaffirmation of exemption with the county assessor on or before
December 31 of the year preceding the year for which the exemption is sought,
on forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, certifying that the ownership and
use of the exempted property has not changed during the year. Any organization
or society which misses the December 31 deadline for filing the statement of
reaffirmation of exemption may file the statement of reaffirmation of exemption
by June 30. Such filing shall maintain the tax-exempt status of the property
without further action by the county and regardless of any previous action by
the county board of equalization to deny the exemption due to late filing of
the statement of reaffirmation of exemption. Upon any such late filing, the
county assessor shall assess a penalty against the property of ten percent of
the tax that would have been assessed had the statement of reaffirmation of
exemption not been filed or one hundred dollars, whichever is less, for each
calendar month or fraction thereof for which the filing of the statement of
-12-

LB647 LB647
2025 2025
reaffirmation of exemption is late. The penalty shall be collected and
distributed in the same manner as a tax on the property and interest shall be
assessed at the rate specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time
to time be adjusted by the Legislature, from the date the tax would have been
delinquent until paid. The penalty shall also become a lien in the same manner
as a tax pursuant to section 77-203.
(4)(a) If any organization, or society, or taxpayer seeks a tax exemption
under subdivision (1)(c), (d), or (f) of section 77-202 for any real or
tangible personal property acquired on or after January 1 of any year or
converted to exempt use on or after January 1 of any year, the organization, or
society, or taxpayer shall make application for exemption on or before July 1
of that year as provided in subsection (1) of section 77-202.01. The procedure
for reviewing the application shall be as in sections 77-202.01 to 77-202.05,
except that the exempt use shall be determined as of the date of application
and the review by the county board of equalization shall be completed by August
15.
(b) If an organization as described in subdivision (1)(c) or (d) of
section 77-202 purchases, between July 1 and the levy date, property that has
been granted tax exemption and the property continues to be qualified for a
property tax exemption, the purchaser shall on or before November 15 make
application for exemption as provided in section 77-202.01. The procedure for
reviewing the application shall be as in sections 77-202.01 to 77-202.05, and
the review by the county board of equalization shall be completed by December
15.
(c) If a taxpayer purchases, between July 1 and the levy date, property
described in subdivision (1)(f) of section 77-202 that has been granted tax
exemption and the property continues to be qualified for a property tax
exemption, the purchaser shall on or before November 15 make application for
exemption as provided in section 77-202.01. The procedure for reviewing the
application shall be as in sections 77-202.01 to 77-202.05, and the review by
the county board of equalization shall be completed by December 15.
(5) In any year, the county assessor or the county board of equalization
may cause a review of any exemption to determine whether the exemption is
proper. Such a review may be taken even if the ownership or use of the property
has not changed from the date of the allowance of the exemption. If it is
determined that a change in an exemption is warranted, the procedure for
hearing set out in section 77-202.02 shall be followed, except that the
published notice shall state that the list provided in the county assessor's
office only includes those properties being reviewed. If an exemption is
denied, the county board of equalization shall place the property on the tax
rolls retroactive to January 1 of that year if on the date of the decision of
the county board of equalization the property no longer qualifies for an
exemption.
The county board of equalization shall give notice of the assessed value
of the real property in the same manner as outlined in section 77-1507, and the
procedures for filing a protest shall be the same as those in section 77-1502.
When personal property which was exempt becomes taxable because of lost
exemption status, the owner or his or her agent has thirty days after the date
of denial to file a personal property return with the county assessor. Upon the
expiration of the thirty days for filing a personal property return pursuant to
this subsection, the county assessor shall proceed to list and value the
personal property and apply the penalty pursuant to section 77-1233.04.
(6) During the month of September of each year, the county board of
equalization shall cause to be published in a paper of general circulation in
the county a list of all real estate in the county exempt from taxation for

bullion. For the purposes of this subsection, bullion has the same meaning as
in section 77-2704.66.
Sec. 36. Section 77-2727, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2727 (1) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section and
subsection (5) of section 77-2775, a partnership as such shall not be subject
to the income tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Persons or their
authorized representatives carrying on business as partners shall be liable for
the income tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 only in their
separate or individual capacities.
(2) The partners of such partnership who are residents of this state or
corporations shall include in their incomes their proportionate share of such
partnership's income.
(3) If any partner of such partnership is a nonresident individual during
any part of the partnership's reporting year, he or she shall file a Nebraska
income tax return which shall include in Nebraska adjusted gross income that
portion of the partnership's Nebraska income, as determined under the
provisions of sections 77-2728 and 77-2729, allocable to his or her interest in
the partnership and shall execute and forward to the partnership, on or before
the original due date of the Nebraska partnership return, an agreement which
states that he or she will file a Nebraska income tax return and pay income tax
on all income derived from or attributable to sources in this state, and such
agreement shall be attached to the partnership's Nebraska return for such
reporting year.
(4)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this subsection, in the
absence of the nonresident individual partner's executed agreement being
attached to the Nebraska partnership return, the partnership shall remit a
portion of such partner's income which was derived from or attributable to
Nebraska sources with its Nebraska return for the reporting year. For tax years
beginning or deemed to begin before January 1, 2013, the amount of remittance,
in such instance, shall be the highest individual income tax rate determined
under section 77-2715.02 multiplied by the nonresident individual partner's
share of the partnership income which was derived from or attributable to
sources within this state. For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or
after January 1, 2013, the amount of remittance, in such instance, shall be the
highest individual income tax rate determined under section 77-2715.03
multiplied by the nonresident individual partner's share of the partnership
income which was derived from or attributable to sources within this state.
(b) Any amount remitted on behalf of any partner shall be allowed as a
credit against the Nebraska income tax liability of the partner.
(c) Subdivision (a) of this subsection does not apply to a publicly traded
partnership as defined by section 7704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, that is treated as a partnership for the purposes of the code and
that has agreed to file an annual information return with the Department of
Revenue reporting the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and other
information requested by the department of each unit holder with an income in
the state in excess of five hundred dollars.
(5) The Tax Commissioner may allow a nonresident individual partner to not
file a Nebraska income tax return if the nonresident individual partner's only
source of Nebraska income was his or her share of the partnership's income
which was derived from or attributable to sources within this state, the
-21-

LB647 LB647
2025 2025
nonresident did not file an agreement to file a Nebraska income tax return, and
the partnership has remitted the amount required by subsection (4) of this
section on behalf of such nonresident individual partner. The amount remitted
shall be retained in satisfaction of the Nebraska income tax liability of the
nonresident individual partner.
(6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
(a) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2018, a partnership may annually make an irrevocable election to pay the taxes,
interest, or penalties levied by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 at the entity
level for the taxable period covered by such return. For tax years beginning on
or after January 1, 2023, such election may be made on the applicable income
tax return and shall must be made on or before the due date for filing the
applicable income tax return, including any extensions that have been granted;
(b) An electing partnership with respect to a taxable period shall pay an
income tax equivalent to the highest individual income tax rate provided in
section 77-2715.03 multiplied by the electing partnership's net income as
apportioned or allocated to this state in accordance with the Nebraska Revenue
Act of 1967, for such taxable period;
(c) An electing partnership shall be treated as a corporation with respect
to the requirements of section 77-2769 for payments of estimated tax. The
requirement for payment of estimated tax under section 77-2769 shall not apply
for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2024. Payments of estimated tax
made by an eligible partnership that does not make an election under this
subsection shall be treated as income tax withholding on behalf of the
partners;
(d) Except as provided in subdivision (e) of this subsection, the partners
of an electing partnership shall must file a Nebraska return to report their
pro rata or distributive share of the income of the electing partnership in
accordance with the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, as applicable. In determining
the sum of its pro rata or distributive share and computing the tax under this
subsection, an electing partnership shall add back any amount of Nebraska
income tax imposed under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and deducted by the
electing partnership for federal income tax purposes under section 164 of the
Internal Revenue Code;
(e) A nonresident individual who is a partner of an electing partnership
shall not be required to file a Nebraska tax return for a taxable year if, for
such taxable year, the only source of income derived from or connected with
sources within this state for such partner, or for the partner and the
partner's spouse if a joint federal income tax return is filed, is from one or
more electing partnerships or electing small business corporations as defined
in subdivision (9)(a) of section 77-2734.01 for such taxable year and such
nonresident individual partner's tax under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967
would be fully satisfied by the credit allowed to such partner under
subdivision (g) of this subsection;
(f) If the amount calculated under subdivision (a) of this subsection
results in a net operating loss, such net operating loss may not be carried
forward to succeeding taxable years;
(g)(i) A refundable credit shall be available to the partners in an amount
equal to their pro rata or distributive share of the Nebraska income tax paid
by the electing partnership. For tax returns filed for taxable years beginning
or deemed to begin on or after January 1, 2022, such credit shall be allowed
for the same taxable year for which the election is made, without regard to the
year in which the tax is paid to Nebraska or deducted on a federal income tax
return;
(ii) In the case of a partnership or small business corporation that is a
partner of an electing partnership, the refundable credit under this
subdivision (g) shall (A) be allowed to its partners or shareholders in
accordance with the determination of income and distributive share of the
Nebraska income tax paid by the electing partnership or (B) be applied against
the partner's tax, interest, and penalty. Any excess credit deemed an
overpayment may be refunded or applied to the subsequent tax year;
(iii) If a partnership making the election under this subsection is a
partner of another electing partnership, net income shall be computed as
provided in subsection (1) of this section. The upper tier electing partnership
shall claim a credit for the tax paid by the lower tier electing partnership.
The upper tier electing partnership shall distribute out the pro rata or
distributive share of the credits to its partners for tax paid under this
subsection by all tiers of electing partnerships. As used in this subdivision,
the term lower tier electing partnership means an electing partnership in which
some or all of the partners are an electing partnership. The term upper tier
electing partnership means an electing partnership that is a partner of a lower
tier electing partnership. An electing partnership may have two or more tiers;
and
(h)(i) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2018, but prior to January 1, 2023, the electing partnership shall must make
the election under this subsection on or after January 1, 2023, but before
December 31, 2025, in the form and manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner
for all years for which the election under this subsection is made on behalf of
the electing partnership. The Tax Commissioner shall establish the form and
manner, which shall not include any changes to the past returns other than
those that are directly related to the election under this subsection.
(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if an electing
partnership files in the form and manner as specified in subdivision (h)(i) of
-22-

LB647 LB647
2025 2025
this subsection, the deadline for filing a claim for credit or refund
prescribed in section 77-2793 shall be extended for affected partners of the
electing partnership until the timeframe specified in section 77-2793 or
January 31, 2026, whichever is later. The resulting claim of refund for tax
years beginning prior to January 1, 2023, shall be submitted in the form and
manner as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Neither the electing partnership
nor its partners shall incur any penalties for late filing nor owe interest on
such amounts. The Tax Commissioner shall not be required to pay interest on any
amounts owed to the partners resulting from such refund claims.
(iii) Notwithstanding the dates provided in subdivision (h)(i) of this
subsection, the Tax Commissioner shall have one year from the date an electing
partnership files in the form and manner as specified in subdivision (h)(i) of
this subsection to review and make a written proposed deficiency determination
in accordance with section 77-2786. Any notice of deficiency determination made
as specified in this subdivision may be enforced at any time within six years
from the date of the notice of deficiency determination.
(7) For purposes of this section:
(a) Electing partnership means, with respect to a taxable period, an
eligible partnership that has made an election pursuant to subsection (6) of
this section with respect to such taxable period; and
(b) Eligible partnership means any partnership as provided for in section
7701(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code that has a filing requirement under the
Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 other than a publicly traded partnership as
defined in section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. An eligible partnership
includes any entity, including a limited liability company, treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes that otherwise meets the
requirements of this subdivision.
(8) For purposes of this section, any partner that is a grantor trust of a
nonresident shall be disregarded and this section shall apply as though the
nonresident grantor was the partner.
Sec. 37. Section 77-2734.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
77-2734.01 (1) Residents of Nebraska who are shareholders of a small
business corporation having an election in effect under subchapter S of the
Internal Revenue Code or who are members of a limited liability company
organized pursuant to the Nebraska Uniform Limited Liability Company Act shall
include in their Nebraska taxable income, to the extent includable in federal
gross income, their proportionate share of such corporation's or limited
liability company's federal income adjusted pursuant to this section. Income or
loss from such corporation or limited liability company conducting a business,
trade, profession, or occupation shall be included in the Nebraska taxable
income of a shareholder or member who is a resident of this state to the extent
of such shareholder's or member's proportionate share of the net income or loss
from the conduct of such business, trade, profession, or occupation within this
state, determined under subsection (2) of this section. A resident of Nebraska
shall include in Nebraska taxable income fair compensation for services
rendered to such corporation or limited liability company. Compensation
actually paid shall be presumed to be fair unless it is apparent to the Tax
Commissioner that such compensation is materially different from fair value for
the services rendered or has been manipulated for tax avoidance purposes.
(2) The income of any small business corporation having an election in
effect under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code or limited liability
company organized pursuant to the Nebraska Uniform Limited Liability Company
Act that is derived from or connected with Nebraska sources shall be determined
in the following manner:
(a) If the small business corporation is a member of a unitary group, the
small business corporation shall be deemed to be doing business within this
state if any part of its income is derived from transactions with other members
of the unitary group doing business within this state, and such corporation
shall apportion its income by using the apportionment factor determined for the
entire unitary group, including the small business corporation, under sections
77-2734.05 to 77-2734.15;
(b) If the small business corporation or limited liability company is not
a member of a unitary group and is subject to tax in another state, it shall
apportion its income under sections 77-2734.05 to 77-2734.15; and
(c) If the small business corporation or limited liability company is not
subject to tax in another state, all of its income is derived from or connected
with Nebraska sources.
(3) Nonresidents of Nebraska who are shareholders of such corporations or
members of such limited liability companies shall file a Nebraska income tax
return and shall include in Nebraska adjusted gross income their proportionate
share of the corporation's or limited liability company's Nebraska income as
determined under subsection (2) of this section.
(4) The nonresident shareholder or member shall execute and forward to the
corporation or limited liability company before the filing of the corporation's
or limited liability company's return an agreement which states he or she will
file a Nebraska income tax return and pay the tax on the income derived from or
connected with sources in this state, and such agreement shall be attached to
the corporation's or limited liability company's Nebraska return for such
taxable year.
(5) For taxable years beginning or deemed to begin before January 1, 2013,
in the absence of the nonresident shareholder's or member's executed agreement
being attached to the Nebraska return, the corporation or limited liability

LB647 LB647
2025 2025
company shall remit with the return an amount equal to the highest individual
income tax rate determined under section 77-2715.02 multiplied by the
nonresident shareholder's or member's share of the corporation's or limited
liability company's income which was derived from or attributable to this
state. For taxable years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2013, in the absence of the nonresident shareholder's or member's executed
agreement being attached to the Nebraska return, the corporation or limited
liability company shall remit with the return an amount equal to the highest
individual income tax rate determined under section 77-2715.03 multiplied by
the nonresident shareholder's or member's share of the corporation's or limited
liability company's income which was derived from or attributable to this
state. The amount remitted shall be allowed as a credit against the Nebraska
income tax liability of the shareholder or member.
(6) The Tax Commissioner may allow a nonresident individual shareholder or
member to not file a Nebraska income tax return if the nonresident individual
shareholder's or member's only source of Nebraska income was his or her share
of the small business corporation's or limited liability company's income which
was derived from or attributable to sources within this state, the nonresident
did not file an agreement to file a Nebraska income tax return, and the small
business corporation or limited liability company has remitted the amount
required by subsection (5) of this section on behalf of such nonresident
individual shareholder or member. The amount remitted shall be retained in
satisfaction of the Nebraska income tax liability of the nonresident individual
shareholder or member.
(7) A small business corporation or limited liability company return shall
be filed if the small business corporation or limited liability company has
income derived from Nebraska sources.
(8) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
(a) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2018, a small business corporation may annually make an irrevocable election to
pay the taxes, interest, or penalties levied by the Nebraska Revenue Act of
1967 at the entity level for the taxable period covered by such return. For tax

accordance with the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, for such taxable period;
(c) An electing small business corporation shall be treated as a
corporation with respect to the requirements of section 77-2769 for payments of
estimated tax. The requirement for payment of estimated tax under section
77-2769 shall not apply for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2024.
Payments of estimated tax made by an eligible small business corporation that
does not make an election under this subsection shall be treated as income tax
withholding on behalf of the shareholders;
(d) Except as provided in subdivision (e) of this subsection, the
shareholders of an electing small business corporation shall must file a
Nebraska return to report their pro rata or distributive share of the income of
the electing small business corporation in accordance with the Nebraska Revenue

distributive share and computing the tax under this subsection, an electing
small business corporation shall add back any amount of Nebraska income tax
imposed under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and deducted by the electing
small business corporation for federal income tax purposes under section 164 of

(e) A nonresident individual who is a shareholder of an electing small
business corporation shall not be required to file a Nebraska tax return for a

partnerships as defined in subdivision (7)(a) of section 77-2727 for such

results in a net operating loss, such net operating loss may not be carried
forward to succeeding taxable years;
(g) A refundable credit shall be available to the shareholders in an

credit shall be allowed for the same taxable year for which the election is
made, without regard to the year in which the tax is paid to Nebraska or
deducted on a federal income tax return; and
(h)(i) For tax years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1,
2018, but prior to January 1, 2023, the electing small business corporation

refund for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2023, shall be submitted in
the form and manner as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Neither the electing
small business corporation nor its shareholders shall incur any penalties for
late filing nor owe interest on such amounts. The Tax Commissioner shall not be
required to pay interest on any amounts owed to the shareholders resulting from
such refund claims.
(iii) Notwithstanding the dates provided in subdivision (h)(i) of this
subsection, the Tax Commissioner shall have one year from the date an electing
small business corporation files in the form and manner as specified in
subdivision (h)(i) of this subsection to review and make a written proposed

Sec. 38. Section 77-2776, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2776 (1) As soon as practical after an income tax return is filed, the
Tax Commissioner shall examine it to determine the correct amount of tax. If
the Tax Commissioner finds that the amount of tax shown on the return is less
than the correct amount, he or she shall notify the taxpayer of the amount of
the deficiency proposed to be assessed. If the Tax Commissioner finds that the
tax paid is more than the correct amount, he or she shall credit the
overpayment against any taxes due by the taxpayer and refund the difference.
The Tax Commissioner shall, upon request, make prompt assessment of taxes due
as provided by the laws of the United States for federal income tax purposes.
(2) If the taxpayer fails to file an income tax return, the Tax

the case of a deficiency.
(3) A notice of deficiency shall set forth the reason for the proposed
assessment or for the change in the amount of credit or loss to be carried over
to another year. The notice shall include a written statement containing the
details of the facts, circumstances, and reasons the Tax Commissioner used to
determine that the taxpayer did not report the correct amount of tax. The
notice may be mailed to the taxpayer at his or her last-known address. In the
case of a joint return, the notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice,
except that if the Tax Commissioner is notified by either spouse that separate
residences have been established, the Tax Commissioner shall mail joint notices
to each spouse. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a
notice of deficiency may be mailed to his or her last-known address unless the
Tax Commissioner has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary
relationship with respect to such taxpayer.
(4) A notice of deficiency regarding an item of entity income may be
mailed to the entity at its last-known address or to the address of the
entity's tax matters person for federal income tax purposes. Such notice shall
be deemed to have been received by each partner, shareholder, or member of such
entity, but only for items of entity income reported by the partner,
shareholder, or member. The actions taken thereon on behalf of the partnership,
limited liability company, small business corporation, estate, or trust are
binding on the partners, members, shareholders, or beneficiaries.

relief granted under the act shall be eight hundred seventy million dollars.
For tax year 2029, the total amount of relief granted under the act shall be
nine hundred two million dollars. For tax year 2030 and each tax year
thereafter, the total amount of relief granted under the act shall be the total
amount of relief from the prior year increased by three percent. The relief
shall be in the form of property tax credits which appear on property tax
statements. Property tax credits granted under the act shall be credited
against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts.
(2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each parcel,
the county treasurer shall multiply the amount disbursed to the county under
subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
in the current prior year on the parcel to the school district taxes levied in
the current prior year on all real property in the county. The amount so
determined shall be the property tax credit for that parcel.
(3) If the real property owner qualifies for a homestead exemption under
sections 77-3501 to 77-3529, the owner shall also be qualified for the property
tax credit provided in this section to the extent of any remaining liability
after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the property tax credit
provided in this section results in a property tax liability on the homestead
that is less than zero, the amount of the credit which cannot be used by the
taxpayer shall be returned to the Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the
year the amount disbursed to the county was disbursed. The Property Tax
Administrator shall immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection
to the School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund. Upon the return of any
funds under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a
report with the Property Tax Administrator, on a form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner, indicating the amount of funds distributed to each school
district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the amount of
unused credits returned.
(4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be equal
to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of this section
multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied in the prior year
on all real property in the county to the school district taxes levied in the
prior year on all real property in the state. By September 15, 2024, and by
September 15 of each year thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount to be disbursed under this subsection to each county and
shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The
disbursements to the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on
or before January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
(5) After retaining one percent of the amount The county treasurer shall
disburse amounts received under subsection (4) of this section for costs, the
county treasurer shall disburse the remaining funds, which are credited against
the amount of property taxes owed to school districts, in the same manner as if
such funds had been received in the form of property tax payments for property
taxes owed to school districts, meaning any amounts attributable to divided
taxes pursuant to section 18-2147 of the Community Development Law shall be
remitted to the applicable authority for which such taxes were divided.
(6) The School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund shall be used for
purposes of making the disbursements to counties required under subsection (4)
of this section.
Sec. 40. Section 85-1801, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
85-1801 The Legislature finds that the general welfare and well-being of
the state are directly related to educational levels and skills of the citizens
of the state and that a vital and valid public purpose is served by the
creation and implementation of programs which encourage and make possible the
attainment of higher levels of education by the greatest number of citizens of
the state. The state has limited resources to provide additional programs for
higher education funding and the continued operation and maintenance of the
state's public institutions of elementary, secondary, and postsecondary higher
education, and the general welfare of the citizens of the state will be
enhanced by establishing a program which allows parents and others interested
in the higher education of our youth to invest money in a public trust for
future application to the payment of qualified higher education expenses. The
creation of the means of encouragement for persons to invest in such a program
represents the carrying out of a vital and valid public purpose. In order to
make available to parents and others interested in the higher education of our
youth an opportunity to fund future higher education needs, it is necessary
that a public trust be established in which money may be invested for future
educational use.
Sec. 41. Section 85-1802, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended

limited means. The State Treasurer shall implement and administer the program.
(2) A participant shall be eligible for the program if the beneficiary for
whom private contributions are made is part of a family whose household income
for the most recently completed taxable year is not more than two hundred fifty
percent of the federal poverty level and the beneficiary is a resident of the
State of Nebraska.
(3) Applications for participation in the program shall be submitted to
the State Treasurer on forms prescribed by the State Treasurer. If the

subsection (7) of this section has been reached.
(4) Any participant who is approved for the program under subsection (3)
of this section must resubmit an application each year thereafter and be
reapproved in order to continue participation in the program.
(5) If a participant is approved for the program, any contribution made by
such participant under the program shall be matched with scholarship funds
provided by the State of Nebraska. The matching scholarship shall be equal to:
(a) One hundred percent of the participant's contribution if the
beneficiary for whom the contribution is made is part of a family whose
household income for the most recently completed taxable year is more than two
hundred percent of the federal poverty level but not more than two hundred
fifty percent of the federal poverty level, not to exceed one thousand dollars
annually; or
(b) Two hundred percent of the participant's contribution if the

Plan Expense Fund or the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund, as determined by the
State Treasurer, to the College Savings Incentive Cash Fund. The State

Nebraska educational savings plan trust shall own all scholarships awarded
under this section. Neither the participant nor the beneficiary shall have any
ownership rights to or interest in, title to, or power or control over such
scholarships. Scholarship funds disbursed shall only be used to pay the
qualified higher education expenses associated with attending an eligible
postsecondary educational institution located in this state and shall not be
used to pay expenses associated with attending kindergarten through grade
twelve. Any disbursement of such scholarships shall be made before the
beneficiary reaches thirty years of age. Once the beneficiary reaches thirty
years of age, any unused scholarship funds shall be transferred to the
Meadowlark Endowment Fund.
(7) The State Treasurer may approve a total of two hundred fifty thousand
dollars of scholarships each calendar year under the College Savings Plan Low-
