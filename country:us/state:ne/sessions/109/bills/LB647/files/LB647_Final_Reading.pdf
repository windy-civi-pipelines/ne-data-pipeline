6 warranted, the procedure for hearing set out in section 77-202.02 shall
7 be followed, except that the published notice shall state that the list
8 provided in the county assessor's office only includes those properties
9 being reviewed. If an exemption is denied, the county board of

20 not be carried forward to succeeding taxable years;
21 (g)(i) A refundable credit shall be available to the partners in an
22 amount equal to their pro rata or distributive share of the Nebraska
23 income tax paid by the electing partnership. For tax returns filed for
24 taxable years beginning or deemed to begin on or after January 1, 2022,

28 (ii) In the case of a partnership or small business corporation that
29 is a partner of an electing partnership, the refundable credit under this
30 subdivision (g) shall (A) be allowed to its partners or shareholders in
31 accordance with the determination of income and distributive share of the

8 partnership shall claim a credit for the tax paid by the lower tier
9 electing partnership. The upper tier electing partnership shall

20 shall must make the election under this subsection on or after January 1,
21 2023, but before December 31, 2025, in the form and manner prescribed by

14 an account.
15 (6) Any disbursement from an account opened under the Meadowlark
