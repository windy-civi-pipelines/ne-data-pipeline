23 paying jobs for residents. The Legislature further finds that workforce

27 development, the Legislature intends to provide a revolving loan program
28 as a rational means to address these needs.

12 purposes of carrying out the workforce training and infrastructure
13 development revolving loan program pursuant to the ImagiNE Nebraska Act.
14 It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate five million dollars

23 applicants under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act and interest on such loans may
24 be repaid using credits earned under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act. If that

26 State Treasurer, who shall, within thirty days, transfer the amount of
27 the credit used from the General Fund to the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving
28 Loan Fund.

3 underpayment of tax and may be recovered by the Department of Revenue.
4 (6) Whether repaid using credits or repaid directly by the recipient
5 of the loan, loans made from the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving Loan Fund
6 shall be repaid with interest at the rate established in section 45-102.

17 77-6841 (1) The Legislature finds that providing job training is
18 critical to the public purpose of attracting and retaining businesses and
19 that the growth of high-paying jobs in Nebraska is limited by an unmet
20 need for workforce training and infrastructure development. The
21 Legislature further finds that many communities in Nebraska lack the
22 infrastructure, including broadband access, necessary to provide high-
23 paying jobs for residents. The Legislature further finds that workforce
24 training and infrastructure development help businesses and improve the
25 quality of life for workers and communities in Nebraska. Because there is
26 a statewide benefit from workforce training and infrastructure
27 development, the Legislature intends to provide a revolving loan program
28 as a rational means to address these needs.
29 (2) The Department of Economic Development shall establish and
30 administer a revolving loan program for workforce training and
31 infrastructure development expenses to be incurred by applicants for

12 purposes of carrying out the workforce training and infrastructure
13 development revolving loan program pursuant to the ImagiNE Nebraska Act.
14 It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate five million dollars

22 the criteria established in sections 77-6842 and 77-6843. Loans made to
23 applicants under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act and interest on such loans may
24 be repaid using credits earned under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act. If that
25 occurs, the Department of Revenue shall certify the credit usage to the
26 State Treasurer, who shall, within thirty days, transfer the amount of
27 the credit used from the General Fund to the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving
28 Loan Fund.

5 of the loan, loans made from the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving Loan Fund
6 shall be repaid with interest at the rate established in section 45-102.
