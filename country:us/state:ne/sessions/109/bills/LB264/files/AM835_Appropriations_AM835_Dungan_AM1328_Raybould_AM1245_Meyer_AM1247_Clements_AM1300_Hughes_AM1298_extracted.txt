8 77-6841 (1) The Legislature finds that providing job training is
9 critical to the public purpose of attracting and retaining businesses and
10 that the growth of high-paying jobs in Nebraska is limited by an unmet
11 need for workforce training and infrastructure development. The
12 Legislature further finds that many communities in Nebraska lack the
13 infrastructure, including broadband access, necessary to provide high-
14 paying jobs for residents. The Legislature further finds that workforce
15 training and infrastructure development help businesses and improve the
16 quality of life for workers and communities in Nebraska. Because there is
17 a statewide benefit from workforce training and infrastructure
18 development, the Legislature intends to provide a revolving loan program
19 as a rational means to address these needs.

21 administer a revolving loan program for workforce training and
22 infrastructure development expenses to be incurred by applicants for
23 incentives under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act.

12 ImagiNE Nebraska Act to secure new, high-paying jobs in Nebraska based on
13 the criteria established in sections 77-6842 and 77-6843. Loans made to
14 applicants under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act and interest on such loans may
15 be repaid using credits earned under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act. If that
16 occurs, the Department of Revenue shall certify the credit usage to the
17 State Treasurer, who shall, within thirty days, transfer the amount of
18 the credit used from the General Fund to the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving
19 Loan Fund.
20 (5) If a taxpayer with an agreement under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act
21 obtains a loan under this section and fails to attain the required
22 minimum number of new employees, minimum compensation, and minimum
23 required cumulative investment necessary for that taxpayer to earn a
24 credit, the principal and interest of the loan shall be considered an
25 underpayment of tax and may be recovered by the Department of Revenue.
26 (6) Whether repaid using credits or repaid directly by the recipient
27 of the loan, loans made from the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving Loan Fund
28 shall be repaid with interest at the rate established in section 45-102.
