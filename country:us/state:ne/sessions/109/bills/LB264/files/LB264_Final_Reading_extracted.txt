9 77-6841 (1) The Legislature finds that providing job training is
10 critical to the public purpose of attracting and retaining businesses and

13 Legislature further finds that many communities in Nebraska lack the

15 paying jobs for residents. The Legislature further finds that workforce
16 training and infrastructure development help businesses and improve the
17 quality of life for workers and communities in Nebraska. Because there is

19 development, the Legislature intends to provide a revolving loan program
20 as a rational means to address these needs.

4 purposes of carrying out the workforce training and infrastructure

13 ImagiNE Nebraska Act to secure new, high-paying jobs in Nebraska based on
14 the criteria established in sections 77-6842 and 77-6843. Loans made to
15 applicants under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act and interest on such loans may
16 be repaid using credits earned under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act. If that
17 occurs, the Department of Revenue shall certify the credit usage to the
18 State Treasurer, who shall, within thirty days, transfer the amount of
19 the credit used from the General Fund to the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving
20 Loan Fund.

22 obtains a loan under this section and fails to attain the required

25 credit, the principal and interest of the loan shall be considered an
26 underpayment of tax and may be recovered by the Department of Revenue.
27 (6) Whether repaid using credits or repaid directly by the recipient
28 of the loan, loans made from the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving Loan Fund
29 shall be repaid with interest at the rate established in section 45-102.

9 77-6841 (1) The Legislature finds that providing job training is
10 critical to the public purpose of attracting and retaining businesses and

13 Legislature further finds that many communities in Nebraska lack the

15 paying jobs for residents. The Legislature further finds that workforce
16 training and infrastructure development help businesses and improve the
17 quality of life for workers and communities in Nebraska. Because there is
18 a statewide benefit from workforce training and infrastructure
19 development, the Legislature intends to provide a revolving loan program
20 as a rational means to address these needs.

3 Nebraska Revolving Loan Fund for fiscal years 2022-23 and 2023-24 for
4 purposes of carrying out the workforce training and infrastructure
5 development revolving loan program pursuant to the ImagiNE Nebraska Act.

7 for fiscal years 2022-23 and 2023-24 for purposes of carrying out the
8 workforce training and infrastructure development revolving loan program

10 (4) The Department of Economic Development, as part of its

12 Nebraska Revolving Loan Fund and may loan funds to applicants under the
13 ImagiNE Nebraska Act to secure new, high-paying jobs in Nebraska based on
14 the criteria established in sections 77-6842 and 77-6843. Loans made to
15 applicants under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act and interest on such loans may
16 be repaid using credits earned under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act. If that
17 occurs, the Department of Revenue shall certify the credit usage to the
18 State Treasurer, who shall, within thirty days, transfer the amount of
19 the credit used from the General Fund to the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving
20 Loan Fund.

22 obtains a loan under this section and fails to attain the required
23 minimum number of new employees, minimum compensation, and minimum

25 credit, the principal and interest of the loan shall be considered an
26 underpayment of tax and may be recovered by the Department of Revenue.
27 (6) Whether repaid using credits or repaid directly by the recipient
28 of the loan, loans made from the ImagiNE Nebraska Revolving Loan Fund
29 shall be repaid with interest at the rate established in section 45-102.
