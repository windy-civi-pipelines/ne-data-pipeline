4 assistance program shall be indebted to the department for the total
5 amount paid for medical assistance on behalf of the recipient if:

7 the medical assistance was provided; or
8 (b) The recipient resided in a medical institution and, at the time

10 is later, the department determines that the recipient could not have
11 reasonably been expected to be discharged and resume living at home. For
12 purposes of this section, medical institution means a nursing facility,
13 an intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
14 disabilities, an assisted living facility, or an inpatient hospital.
15 (2)(a) (2) The debt accruing under subsection (1) of this section
16 arises during the life of the recipient but shall be held in abeyance
17 until the death of the recipient. Any such debt to the department that

19 the recipient's spouse, if any, and only after the recipient is not
20 survived by a child who either is under twenty-one years of age or is
21 blind or totally and permanently disabled as defined by the Supplemental
22 Security Income criteria. In recovering such debt, the department shall
23 not foreclose on a lien on the home of the recipient (i) (a) if a sibling
24 of the recipient with an equity interest in the home has lawfully resided
25 in the home for at least one year before the recipient's admission and
26 has lived there continuously since the date of the recipient's admission
27 or (ii) (b) while the home is the residence of a relative an adult child

2 or she provided care that delayed the recipient's admission. Such care
3 may be reimbursed or unreimbursed. For purposes of this section, relative
4 means a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, sibling, or other individual
5 who can establish a close relationship tie.
6 (b) A written attestation by a physician stating that a relative of

18 section as a result of the death of such recipient. The debt may be
19 recovered from the estate of a recipient of medical assistance. The

-6-
LB641 LB641
2025 2025
1 because of sickness or injury to any person resulting from a third
2 party's wrongful act or negligence and the person has recovered damages
3 from such third party, the department shall have the right to recover the
4 medical assistance it paid from any amounts that the person has received
5 as follows:
6 (i) In those cases in which the person is fully compensated by the
7 recovery, the department shall be fully reimbursed subject to its
8 contribution to attorney's fees and costs as provided in subdivision (b)
9 of this subsection; or
10 (ii) In those cases in which the person is not fully compensated by
11 the recovery, the department shall be reimbursed that portion of the
12 recovery that represents the same proportionate reduction of medical
13 expenses paid that the recovery amount bears to full compensation of the
14 person subject to its contributions to attorney's fees and costs as

20 to the person shall be reduced by an amount that represents the
21 department's reasonable pro rata share of attorney's fees and costs of
22 litigation or the costs incurred in pursuit of a claim.
