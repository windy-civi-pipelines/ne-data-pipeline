9 on delinquent taxes specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from

11 (16)(a) The purpose of this subsection is to set forth the state's
12 policy for the protection of the confidentiality rights of all
13 participants in the system operated pursuant to the streamlined sales and
14 use tax agreement and of the privacy interests of consumers who deal with
15 model 1 sellers.
16 (b) For purposes of this subsection:
17 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
18 person;
19 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
20 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
21 (iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
22 identifies a person.
23 (c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers
24 is to preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
25 With very limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform
26 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
27 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
28 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
29 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only
30 if that certified service provider certifies that:
31 (i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the
-107-

LB298 LB298
2025 2025
1 fundamental precept of anonymity is respected;
2 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
3 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to
4 exempt purchasers;
5 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
6 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
7 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at
8 all, it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information
9 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
10 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
11 service provider;
12 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
13 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
14 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
15 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
16 and
17 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
18 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
19 unauthorized access and disclosure.
20 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
21 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
22 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
23 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
24 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
25 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
26 longer be retained by the member states.
27 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
28 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
29 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
30 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
31 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
-108-

LB298 LB298
2025 2025
1 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
2 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
3 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
4 such request.
5 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
6 General.
7 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
8 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
9 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
10 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:
11 (i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement
12 and state law;
13 (ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information
14 Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
15 (iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
16 taxpayer information;
17 (iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of
18 federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the
19 Internal Revenue Service; and
20 (v) Collect, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise use anonymous data
21 for governmental purposes.
