14 Sec. 25. The Legislature finds and declares that:
15 (1) It is within the inherent power of the Legislature to secure
16 needed information in order to legislate, hold hearings, and conduct
17 investigations of matters related to the operation of state government.
18 This power of inquiry is broad and indispensable;
19 (2) Article IV, section 23, of the Constitution of Nebraska
20 specifically provides that the Legislature may at any time require that
21 information be provided to it from the officers and employees of state
22 agencies relating to the condition, management, and expenses of their
23 respective offices; and
24 (3) In order to establish a full-time program of investigation and

26 assist in the development of legislation related to such systems, the
27 Legislature created the office of Inspector General of Nebraska Child
28 Welfare.

3 review to provide increased accountability and oversight of the Nebraska

6 system;
7 (b) (c) Provide an independent form of inquiry for concerns
8 regarding the actions of individuals and agencies responsible for the
9 care and protection of children and youth in the Nebraska child welfare
10 system. Confusion of the roles, responsibilities, and accountability
11 structures between individuals, private contractors, branches of
12 government, and agencies in the current system make it difficult for the
13 Legislature to monitor and oversee the Nebraska child welfare system; and
14 (c) (d) Provide a process for investigation and review to determine
15 if individual complaints and issues of investigation and inquiry reveal a
16 problem in the child welfare system, not just individual cases, that
17 necessitates legislative action for improved policies and restructuring
18 of the child welfare system.
19 (2) It is not the intent of the Legislature in enacting the Office
20 of Inspector General of Nebraska Child Welfare Act to interfere with the
21 duties of the Legislative Auditor or the Legislative Fiscal Analyst or to
22 interfere with the statutorily defined investigative responsibilities or
23 prerogatives of any officer, agency, board, bureau, commission,
24 association, society, or institution of the executive or judicial branch
25 of state government, except that the act does not preclude an inquiry on
26 the sole basis that another agency has the same responsibility. The act
27 shall not be construed to interfere with or supplant the responsibilities
28 or prerogatives of the Governor to investigate, monitor, and report on
29 the activities of the agencies, boards, bureaus, commissions,
30 associations, societies, and institutions of the executive branch under
31 the Governor's his or her administrative direction.

16 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
17 person;
18 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
19 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
20 (iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
21 identifies a person.
22 (c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers
23 is to preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
24 With very limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform
25 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
26 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
27 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined

LB298 LB298

1 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
2 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to
3 exempt purchasers;
4 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
5 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
6 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at
7 all, it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information
8 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
9 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
10 service provider;
11 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
12 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
13 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
14 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
15 and
16 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
17 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
18 unauthorized access and disclosure.
19 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
20 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
21 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
22 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
23 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
24 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
25 longer be retained by the member states.
26 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
27 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
28 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
29 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
30 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
31 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
-107-
AM1504 AM1504
LB298 LB298
MLU - 05/16/2025 MLU - 05/16/2025
1 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
2 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
3 such request.
4 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
5 General.
6 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
7 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
8 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
9 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:
10 (i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement
11 and state law;
12 (ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information
13 Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;

15 taxpayer information;
16 (iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of
17 federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the

15 (b) For purposes of this subsection:
16 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
17 person;
18 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
19 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
20 (iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
21 identifies a person.
22 (c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers
23 is to preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
24 With very limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform
25 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
26 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
27 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
28 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only
29 if that certified service provider certifies that:
30 (i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the

1 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
2 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to
3 exempt purchasers;
4 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
5 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
6 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at
7 all, it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information
8 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
9 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
10 service provider;
11 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
12 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
13 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
14 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
15 and
16 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
17 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
18 unauthorized access and disclosure.
19 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
20 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
21 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
22 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
23 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
24 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
25 longer be retained by the member states.
26 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
27 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
28 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
29 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
30 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
31 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally

LB298 LB298
MLU - 05/16/2025 MLU - 05/16/2025
1 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
2 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
3 such request.
4 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
5 General.
6 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
7 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
8 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
9 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:

13 Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
14 (iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
15 taxpayer information;
16 (iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of
