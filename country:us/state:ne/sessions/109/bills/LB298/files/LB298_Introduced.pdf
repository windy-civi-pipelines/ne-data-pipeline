LB298 LB298

2 Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner in his or her discretion may waive all or
3 part of any penalties provided by the provisions of such act or interest
4 on delinquent taxes specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from
5 time to time be adjusted.
6 (16)(a) The purpose of this subsection is to set forth the state's
7 policy for the protection of the confidentiality rights of all
8 participants in the system operated pursuant to the streamlined sales and
9 use tax agreement and of the privacy interests of consumers who deal with
10 model 1 sellers.
11 (b) For purposes of this subsection:
12 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
13 person;
14 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
15 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
16 (iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
17 identifies a person.
18 (c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers
19 is to preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
20 With very limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform
21 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
22 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
23 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
24 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only
25 if that certified service provider certifies that:
26 (i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the
27 fundamental precept of anonymity is respected;
28 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
29 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to
30 exempt purchasers;
31 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
-98-

LB298 LB298
2025 2025
1 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
2 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at
3 all, it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information
4 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
5 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
6 service provider;
7 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
8 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
9 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
10 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
11 and
12 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
13 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
14 unauthorized access and disclosure.
15 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
16 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
17 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
18 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
19 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
20 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
21 longer be retained by the member states.
22 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
23 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
24 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
25 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
26 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
27 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
28 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
29 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
30 such request.
31 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
-99-

LB298 LB298
2025 2025
1 General.
2 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
3 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
4 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
5 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:
6 (i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement
7 and state law;
8 (ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information
9 Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
10 (iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
11 taxpayer information;

13 federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the
14 Internal Revenue Service; and
15 (v) Collect, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise use anonymous data
16 for governmental purposes.

9 twenty days from the time of service of the summons.
10 (5) No taxpayer shall be subjected to unreasonable or unnecessary
11 examinations or investigations.
12 (6) Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise
13 provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Tax Commissioner, any

25 action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Tax
26 Commissioner in an action or proceeding under the provisions of the tax
27 law to which he or she is a party or on behalf of any party to any action
28 or proceeding under such sections when the reports or facts shown thereby
29 are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which
30 events the court may require the production of, and may admit in
