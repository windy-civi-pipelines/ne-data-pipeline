1 Section 1. Section 13-3202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 13-3202 The Legislature finds that:
4 (1) Energy efficiency, grid resiliency, and the use of renewable
5 energy are important for preserving the health and economic well-being of
6 Nebraska’s citizens. Using less energy decreases the cost of living and
7 keeps the cost of public power low by delaying the need for additional
8 power plants. By building the market for energy efficiency, grid
9 resiliency, and renewable energy products, economic development will be
10 encouraged and new jobs will be created for Nebraskans in the energy
11 efficiency, grid resiliency, and renewable energy job sectors;
12 (2) To further these goals, the state should promote energy
13 efficiency improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable
14 energy systems;
15 (3) The upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements, grid
16 resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems prohibit many
17 property owners from making improvements. Therefore, it is necessary to
18 authorize municipalities to implement an alternative financing method
19 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts; and
20 (4) Public purposes will be served by providing municipalities with
21 the authority to finance the installation of energy efficiency
22 improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems
23 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts. Such public
24 purposes include, but are not limited to, reduced energy and water costs,
25 reduced greenhouse gas emissions, economic stimulation and development,
26 improved property valuation, and increased employment.
27 Sec. 2. Section 13-3203, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 13-3203 For purposes of the Property Assessed Clean Energy Act:
30 (1) Assessment contract means a contract entered into between a
31 municipality, a property owner, and, if applicable, a third-party lender
-2-

3 assessment for a period not to exceed the weighted average useful life of
4 the energy project;
5 (2) Clean energy assessment district means a district created by a
6 municipality to provide financing for energy projects;
7 (3) Energy efficiency improvement means any acquisition,
8 installation, or modification benefiting publicly or privately owned
9 property that is designed to reduce the electric, gas, water, or other
10 utility demand or consumption of the buildings on, or to be constructed
11 on, such property or to promote the efficient and effective management of
12 natural resources or storm water, including, but not limited to:
13 (a) Insulation in walls, roofs, floors, foundations, or heating and
14 cooling distribution systems;
15 (b) Storm windows and doors; multiglazed windows and doors; heat-
