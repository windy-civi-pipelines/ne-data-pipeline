(4) Other issues relating to standing committees.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH

in Nebraska, to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this
resolution.
2. That the select committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a
report of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative
Council or Legislature.
