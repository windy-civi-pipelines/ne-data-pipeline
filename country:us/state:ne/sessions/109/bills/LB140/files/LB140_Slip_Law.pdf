prohibit the use of an electronic communication device by students while on
school property or attending a school instructional function; and
(ii) May include student discipline and enforcement mechanisms that limit

with the requirements of section 79-262.
(b) A policy adopted pursuant to this section shall not prohibit a student
from using an electronic communication device while on school property or

developed under the Special Education Act and any rules and regulations adopted
or promulgated pursuant to the act or a plan developed under section 504 of the
federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794;
(ii) When authorized by the school district for educational purposes
during instructional time;
(iii) In the case of an emergency or perceived threat of danger;
(iv) When necessary to monitor or manage a student's health care; or
(v) When determined appropriate by the school board or otherwise allowed
by an appropriate school employee.
(3) This section should not be interpreted to authorize monitoring,
collecting, or otherwise accessing any information on an electronic
communication device not owned by or provided for academic use by the school
district.
Sec. 2. Since an emergency exists, this act takes effect when passed and
approved according to law.
