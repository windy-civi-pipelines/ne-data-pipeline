(c) That if the applicant violates any of the provisions of the
application or the license, any section of the act, or any of the rules and
regulations of the commission that apply to manufacturers, the commission may

may determine.
(8) (7) The application for a shipping license under subsection (5) (4) or
(6) (5) of this section shall be in such form as the commission prescribes. The

revoked; and
(e) That the applicant, if a manufacturer, craft brewery, craft
distillery, or farm winery, agrees to notify any wholesaler licensed in
Nebraska that has been authorized to distribute such brands that the
application has been filed for a shipping license. The notice shall be in
writing and in a form prescribed by the commission. The commission may adopt
and promulgate rules and regulations as it reasonably deems necessary to
implement this subdivision, including rules and regulations that permit the
holder of a shipping license under this subdivision to amend the shipping
license by, among other things, adding or deleting any brands of alcoholic
liquor identified in the shipping license.

2025 2025
person in Nebraska to whom alcoholic beverages may be lawfully sold. All such
sales and shipments shall be for personal consumption only and not for resale;
and
(f) Cause the direct shipment of alcoholic liquor to be by approved common
carrier only. The commission shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations

regulations shall include provisions that require (i) the recipient to

(ii) the recipient to sign an electronic or paper form or other acknowledgment
of receipt as approved by the commission, and (iii) the commission-approved
common carrier to submit to the commission such information as the commission
may prescribe. The commission-approved common carrier shall refuse delivery

refuses to present valid identification. All holders of shipping licenses

conspicuous notice in sixteen-point type or larger to the outside of each
package of alcoholic liquor shipped within or into the State of Nebraska, in a
conspicuous location, stating: CONTAINS ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES; SIGNATURE OF

by the common carrier. The common carrier and the holder of the shipping
license shall be liable only for their independent acts.
(10) (9) For purposes of sections 53-160, 77-2703, and 77-27,142, each

political subdivision and remit any excise taxes monthly to the commission and
any sales taxes to the Department of Revenue.
(11) (10) By July 1, 2014, the commission shall report to the General

Class C license may have a sampling designation restricting consumption on the
premises to sampling, but such designation shall not affect sales for
consumption off the premises under such license;

(9) There shall be a bottle club license. All applicable license fees
shall be paid by the applicant or licensee directly to the city or village
treasurer in the case of premises located inside the corporate limits of a city
or village and directly to the county treasurer in the case of premises located
outside the corporate limits of a city or village.
(10) The license year, unless otherwise provided in the Nebraska Liquor
Control Act, shall commence on May 1 of each year and shall end on the
following April 30, except that the license year for a Class C license shall
commence on November 1 of each year and shall end on the following October 31.
During the license year, no license shall be issued for a sum less than the
amount of the annual license fee as fixed in section 53-124.01, regardless of
the time when the application for such license has been made, except that (a)
when there is a purchase of an existing licensed business and a new license of
the same class is issued or (b) upon the issuance of a new license for a
location which has not been previously licensed, the license fee and occupation
taxes shall be prorated on a quarterly basis as of the date of issuance.
Sec. 5. Section 53-124.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:

but within the county shall have the following powers, functions, and duties
with respect to retail, bottle club, craft brewery, microdistillery, and

time upon any premises licensed under the Nebraska Liquor Control Act to
determine whether any provision of the act, any rule or regulation adopted and
promulgated pursuant to the act, or any ordinance, resolution, rule, or
regulation adopted by the local governing body has been or is being violated
and at such time examine the premises of such licensee in connection with such
determination. Any law enforcement officer who determines that any provision of
the act, any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated pursuant to the act, or
any ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation adopted by the local governing
body has been or is being violated shall report such violation in writing to
the executive director of the commission (a) within thirty days after
determining that such violation has occurred, (b) within thirty days after the
conclusion of an ongoing police investigation, or (c) within thirty days after
the verdict in a prosecution related to such an ongoing police investigation if
the prosecuting attorney determines that reporting such violation prior to the
verdict would jeopardize such prosecution, whichever is later;
(3) To receive a signed complaint from any citizen within its jurisdiction
that any provision of the act, any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated
pursuant to the act, or any ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation relating
to alcoholic liquor has been or is being violated and to act upon such

or revocation has been served as provided in the act, to examine or cause to be
examined the books and records of any applicant or licensee except as otherwise
provided for bottle club licensees in section 53-123.08, and to hear testimony
and to take proof for its information in the performance of its duties. For

notice and hearing as provided in section 53-134.04, it determines that the
licensee has violated any of the provisions of the act or any valid and
subsisting ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation duly enacted, adopted,
and promulgated relating to alcoholic liquor. Such order of cancellation or
revocation may be appealed to the commission within thirty days after the date

resolution recommending either issuance or refusal of such license. The clerk
of such city, village, or county shall mail to the commission by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the resolution which shall state the cost of
the published notice, except that failure to comply with this provision shall
not void any license issued by the commission. If the commission refuses to
issue such a license, the cost of publication of notice shall be paid by the
commission from the security for costs;
(8) To review and authorize an application by a retail, bottle club, craft
brewery, farm winery, or microdistillery licensee for a temporary expansion of
