15 act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission

-20-

LB82 LB82
2025 2025
1 omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton

11 6. Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a waiver of

30 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
31 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
-22-

LB82 LB82
2025 2025
1 provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no force or
2 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is
3 invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
4 manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the
5 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
6 review.
7 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each
8 Member State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission
9 conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member
10 State's scope of practice laws governing the Practice of Cosmetology as
11 held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission
12 shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
13 C. The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to
14 the criteria set forth in this Article and the Rules adopted thereunder.
15 Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for

17 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a
18 Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
19 same manner used to adopt the Compact within four (4) years of the date
20 of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and
21 effect in any Member State or to any State applying to participate in the
22 Compact.
23 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
24 Commission.
25 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a
26 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments,
27 data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
28 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at
29 least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission
30 will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall
31 provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
-23-

LB82 LB82
2025 2025
1 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible
2 platform;
3 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's notices

6 H. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
7 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the
8 Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if
9 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
10 Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
11 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference,
12 or other electronic means, the Commission shall include the mechanism for
13 access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
14 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
15 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested
16 person; and
17 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
18 comments.
19 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
20 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to
21 the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
22 J. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring a
23 separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience
24 of the Commission at hearings required by this Article.
25 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final
26 action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full
27 text of the Rule.

30 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
31 substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
-24-

LB82 LB82
2025 2025
1 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
2 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
3 the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Article 11.L, the

10 provided in the Compact and in this Article shall be retroactively
11 applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later
12 than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the
13 purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted
14 immediately to:
15 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
16 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
17 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
18 established by federal law or rule; or

20 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may
21 direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting
22 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or
23 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
24 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by
25 any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision
26 may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material
27 change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to
28 the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
29 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
30 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
31 approval of the Commission.

7 and appropriate to implement the Compact.
8 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the

10 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
11 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
12 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
13 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
14 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for
15 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
16 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
17 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact
18 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
19 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall
20 render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or
21 promulgated Rules.
22 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
23 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in
24 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact
25 or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to
26 the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the default,
27 the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the
28 Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
29 assistance regarding the default.

31 the other Member States.
-26-

2025 2025
1 3. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
2 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
3 majority of the delegates of the Member States, and all rights,
4 privileges, and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
5 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
6 does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities
7 incurred during the period of default.
8 4. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only
9 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
10 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the

12 legislature, the defaulting State's State Licensing Authority, and each
13 of the Member States' State Licensing Authority.

19 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees who hold a
20 Multistate License within that State of such termination. The terminated

22 Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
23 said notice of termination.
24 7. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that
25 is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact,
26 unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting
27 State.
28 8. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by
29 petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
30 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices.
31 The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
-27-

LB82 LB82
2025 2025
1 including reasonable attorney's fees.
2 C. Dispute Resolution
3 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to
4 resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States
5 and between Member and non-Member States.
6 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
7 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
8 D. Enforcement
9 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
10 shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the Commission's Rules.
11 2. By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, the Commission
12 may initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the United
13 States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
14 district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce
15 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules.
16 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
17 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
18 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's
19 fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
20 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
21 federal or the defaulting Member State's law.
22 3. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Commission
23 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
24 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
25 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
26 Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.
27 In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
28 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
29 attorney's fees.

23 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the

29 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court
30 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any

11 held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact
12 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
13 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all
14 severable matters.
