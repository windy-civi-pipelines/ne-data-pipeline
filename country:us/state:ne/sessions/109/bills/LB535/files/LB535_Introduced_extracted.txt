2 29-2221 (1) Whoever has been twice convicted of a crime, sentenced,
3 and committed to prison, in this or any other state or by the United
4 States or once in this state and once at least in any other state or by
5 the United States, for terms of not less than one year each shall, upon
6 conviction of a felony committed in this state, be deemed to be a
7 habitual criminal and shall be punished by imprisonment in a Department
8 of Correctional Services adult correctional facility for a mandatory
9 minimum term of ten years and a maximum term of not more than sixty
10 years, except that:
11 (a) If the felony committed is in violation of section 28-303,
12 28-304, 28-308, 28-313, 28-319, 28-319.01, 28-502, 28-929, or 28-1222 or

20 of subsection (3) of section 28-306 and the other is in violation of one
21 of the sections set forth in subdivision (a) of this subsection or if the
22 felony committed is in violation of one of the sections set forth in
23 subdivision (a) of this subsection and both of the prior convictions are
24 in violation of subsection (3) of section 28-306, the mandatory minimum
25 term shall be twenty-five years and the maximum term not more than sixty
26 years;
27 (c) If the felony committed and at least one of the prior felony
28 convictions do not involve sexual contact, sexual penetration, the threat

-18-
LB535 LB535
2025 2025
1 years and the maximum term not more than the maximum term for the felony

7 (2) When punishment of an accused as a habitual criminal is sought,
8 the facts with reference thereto shall be charged in the indictment or
9 information which contains the charge of the felony upon which the
10 accused is prosecuted, but the fact that the accused is charged with
11 being a habitual criminal shall not be an issue upon the trial of the
12 felony charge and shall not in any manner be disclosed to the jury. If
13 the accused is convicted of a felony, before sentence is imposed a

21 so convicted as a habitual criminal.
22 (3) If the person so convicted shows to the satisfaction of the
23 court before which the conviction was had that he or she was released
24 from imprisonment upon either of such sentences upon a pardon granted for
25 the reason that he or she was innocent, such conviction and sentence

3 and committed to prison, in this or any other state or by the United
4 States or once in this state and once at least in any other state or by
5 the United States, for terms of not less than one year each shall, upon
6 conviction of a felony committed in this state, be deemed to be a
7 habitual criminal and shall be punished by imprisonment in a Department
8 of Correctional Services adult correctional facility for a mandatory
9 minimum term of ten years and a maximum term of not more than sixty
10 years, except that:
11 (a) If the felony committed is in violation of section 28-303,
12 28-304, 28-308, 28-313, 28-319, 28-319.01, 28-502, 28-929, or 28-1222 or

20 of subsection (3) of section 28-306 and the other is in violation of one
21 of the sections set forth in subdivision (a) of this subsection or if the
22 felony committed is in violation of one of the sections set forth in
23 subdivision (a) of this subsection and both of the prior convictions are
24 in violation of subsection (3) of section 28-306, the mandatory minimum
25 term shall be twenty-five years and the maximum term not more than sixty
26 years;
27 (c) If the felony committed and at least one of the prior felony

1 years and the maximum term not more than the maximum term for the felony

21 so convicted as a habitual criminal.
22 (3) If the person so convicted shows to the satisfaction of the
23 court before which the conviction was had that he or she was released
24 from imprisonment upon either of such sentences upon a pardon granted for
25 the reason that he or she was innocent, such conviction and sentence
