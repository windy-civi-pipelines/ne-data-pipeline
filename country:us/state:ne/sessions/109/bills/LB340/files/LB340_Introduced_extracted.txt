2025 2025
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 7 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Asbestos Trust Claims Transparency Act.
3 Sec. 2. For purposes of the Asbestos Trust Claims Transparency Act:
4 (1) Asbestos action means a civil action arising out of, based on,
5 or related to the health effects of exposure to asbestos and any
6 derivative claim made by or on behalf of a person exposed to asbestos or
7 a representative, spouse, parent, child, or other relative of such
8 person;
9 (2) Asbestos trust means a government-approved or court-approved
10 trust, qualified settlement fund, compensation fund, or claims facility
11 that is:
12 (a) Created as a result of an administrative or legal action, a
13 court-approved bankruptcy, or pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 524(g) or 11 U.S.C.
14 1121(a) or other applicable provision of law; and
15 (b) Intended to provide compensation for claims arising out of,
16 based on, or related to the health effects of exposure to asbestos;
17 (3) Trust claim materials means a final executed proof of claim and
18 documents or information submitted to or received from an asbestos trust,
19 including:
20 (a) Claim forms and supplementary materials, proofs of claim,
21 affidavits, depositions, medical and health records, trial testimony,
22 work history, and exposure allegations; and
23 (b) Documents that reflect the status of a claim against an asbestos
24 trust and, if the trust claim has been resolved, documents relating to
25 the resolution of the trust claim; and
26 (4) Trust governance documents means documents that relate to
27 eligibility and payment levels for an asbestos trust, including claims
28 payment matrices, trust distribution procedures, or plans for

30 Sec. 3. (1) Within thirty days after filing an asbestos action, the
31 claimant shall submit all available asbestos trust claims, produce all
-2-
LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 trust claims materials, and file and provide all parties with an
2 affidavit indicating that all asbestos trust claims that can be made by
3 the claimant have been filed and that all trust claims materials produced
4 by the claimant are true and complete. A deferral or placeholder claim
5 that is missing necessary documentation for the asbestos trust to pay the
6 claim does not meet the requirements of this section. The claimant shall
7 produce all trust claims filed by a person other than the claimant if the
8 asbestos action is based on exposure to asbestos through that person and
9 the materials are available to the claimant or claimant's counsel.
10 (2) A claimant shall supplement the information and materials
11 required under subsection (1) of this section after supplementing an
12 asbestos trust claim, receiving additional information or materials
13 related to an asbestos trust claim, or filing an additional trust claim.
14 Sec. 4. (1) Not less than sixty days before trial of an asbestos
15 action, if a defendant believes the claimant has not filed all asbestos
16 trust claims as required by section 3 of this act, the defendant may move
17 the court for an order to require the claimant to file the additional
18 trust claims the defendant believes the claimant is eligible to file.
19 (2) If the court determines there is a sufficient basis for the
20 claimant to file an asbestos trust claim identified by the defendant, the
21 court shall order the claimant to file the asbestos trust claim, produce
22 all related trust claim materials, and produce an affidavit stating that
23 all such materials are true and complete. The court shall not set the
24 asbestos action for trial earlier than ninety days after the claimant
25 complies with this section.
26 Sec. 5. (1) Trust claim materials and trust governance documents
27 are admissible as evidence in an asbestos action and are presumed to be
28 relevant and authentic. No claims of privilege apply to trust claim
29 materials or trust governance documents.
30 (2) A defendant in an asbestos action may seek discovery from an
31 asbestos trust. The claimant may not claim privilege or confidentiality
-3-
LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 to bar discovery and shall provide consent or other expression of
2 permission that may be required by the asbestos trust to release
3 information and materials sought by a defendant.
4 Sec. 6. In an asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
5 setoffs are permitted under applicable law, a defendant is entitled to a
6 setoff in the amount the claimant has received from an asbestos trust
7 and, for trust claims not yet paid as of the date of entry of judgment,
8 the amount the claimant will receive as specified in the applicable trust
9 governance documents. If multiple defendants are found liable for
10 damages, the court shall distribute the amount of setoff proportionally
11 between the defendants, according to the liability of each defendant.
12 Sec. 7. The Asbestos Trust Claims Transparency Act applies to
13 asbestos actions filed on or after the effective date of this act.
14 Sec. 8. Sections 8 to 17 of this act shall be known and may be
15 cited as the Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming Reform Act.

8 dusts, that may cause pulmonary impairment, and the nature, duration, and
9 level of any exposure;
10 (3) A detailed medical, social, and smoking history from the exposed
11 person or, if that person is deceased, from the person most
12 knowledgeable, including a thorough review of the past and present
13 medical problems of the exposed person;
14 (4) Evidence verifying that at least fifteen years have elapsed
15 between the exposed person's date of first exposure to asbestos and the
16 date of diagnosis;
17 (5) Evidence that the exposed person has, or the deceased person
18 had, a permanent respiratory impairment rating of at least Class 2 as
19 defined by and evaluated in accordance with the AMA Guides;
20 (6) Evidence that asbestosis or diffuse bilateral pleural
21 thickening, rather than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a
22 substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's physical
23 impairment, based on a determination the exposed person has any of the
24 following:
25 (a) FVC below the predicted lower limit of normal and FEV1/FVC ratio
26 (using actual values) equal to or above the predicted lower limit of
27 normal;
28 (b) Total lung capacity, by plethysmography or timed gas dilution,
29 below the predicted lower limit of normal; or
30 (c) A chest X-ray showing bilateral small, irregular opacities (s,
31 t, or u) graded by a certified B Reader as at least 2/1 on the ILO
-10-
LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 system; and
2 (7) A statement from the qualified physician that exposure to
3 asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's
4 physical impairment and that such physical impairment was likely not the
5 result of other causes. A statement from the qualified physician that the
6 exposed person's physical impairment is "consistent with exposure to
7 asbestos" or "compatible with exposure to asbestos", or words to that
8 effect, shall not satisfy this section.
9 Sec. 13. (1) To make the prima facie showing required by section 11
10 of this act in an asbestos action related to an alleged asbestos-related
11 malignant condition, the detailed narrative medical report signed by a
12 qualified physician with supporting test results shall include the
13 following:
14 (a) A diagnosis that the exposed person has a malignant asbestos-
15 related condition; and
16 (b) A statement from the qualified physician that exposure to
17 asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's
18 malignant condition and not the result of other causes, and a detailed
19 explanation for that opinion. A statement from the qualified physician
20 that the malignant condition is "consistent with exposure to asbestos" or
21 "compatible with exposure to asbestos", or words to that effect, shall
22 not satisfy this section.
23 (2) The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing and determine if the
24 exposed person has established a prima facie showing of a malignant
25 condition for which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing
26 factor.
27 Sec. 14. (1) Evidence relating to the prima facie showings required
28 under the Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming Reform Act does not
29 create a presumption the exposed person has an asbestos-related
30 impairment and is not conclusive as to the liability of any defendant.
31 (2) Evidence shall not be offered at trial and the jury shall not be
-11-
LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 informed of:
2 (a) The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss an asbestos action
3 under the act; or
4 (b) The provisions of the act with respect to what constitutes a
5 prima facie showing of asbestos impairment.
6 (3) Evidence relating to physical impairment offered in an asbestos
7 action:
8 (a) Must comply with the quality controls, equipment requirements,
9 methods of calibration, and techniques set forth in the AMA Guides and
10 official technical statements of the American Thoracic Society;
11 (b) Shall not be based on testing or examinations that violate a
12 law, regulation, licensing requirement, or medical code of practice of
13 this state or of the state in which the examination or test was
14 conducted; and
15 (c) Shall not be obtained under the condition the exposed person
16 retains the services of an attorney or law firm.
17 Sec. 15. Until a court enters an order determining that the exposed
18 person has established prima facie evidence of impairment, an asbestos
19 action is not subject to discovery, except discovery related to
20 establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence.
21 Sec. 16. A court may consolidate for trial any number and type of
22 asbestos actions with the consent of all parties. In the absence of such
23 consent, the court may consolidate for trial only asbestos actions
24 relating to the exposed person and members of that person's household.
25 Sec. 17. The Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming Reform Act
26 applies to asbestos actions filed on or after the effective date of this
27 act.
28 Sec. 18. Section 25-224, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 25-224 (1) All product liability actions, except one governed by
31 subsection (5) of this section, shall be commenced within four years next
-12-
LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 after the date on which the death, injury, or damage complained of
2 occurs.
3 (2)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section or any other
4 statutory provision to the contrary, any product liability action, except
5 one governed by section 2-725, Uniform Commercial Code or by subsection
6 (5) of this section, shall be commenced as follows:
7 (i) For products manufactured in Nebraska, within ten years after
8 the date the product which allegedly caused the personal injury, death,
9 or damage was first sold or leased for use or consumption; or
10 (ii) For products manufactured outside Nebraska, within the time
11 allowed by the applicable statute of repose, if any, of the state or
12 country where the product was manufactured, but in no event less than ten
13 years. If the state or country where the product was manufactured does
14 not have an applicable statute of repose, then the only limitation upon
15 the commencement of an action for product liability shall be as set forth
16 in subsection (1) of this section.
17 (b) If the changes made to this subsection by Laws 2001, LB 489, are
18 declared invalid or unconstitutional, this subsection as it existed prior
19 to September 1, 2001, shall be deemed in full force and effect and shall
20 apply to all claims in which a final order has not been entered.
21 (3) The limitations contained in subsection (1), (2), or (5) of this
22 section shall not be applicable to indemnity or contribution actions
23 brought by a manufacturer or seller of a product against a person who is
24 or may be liable to such manufacturer or seller for all or any portion of
25 any judgment rendered against a manufacturer or seller.
26 (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of
27 this section, any cause of action or claim which any person may have on
28 July 22, 1978, may be brought not later than two years following such
29 date.
30 (5)(a) (5) Any action to recover damages based on injury allegedly
31 resulting from exposure to asbestos composed of chrysotile, amosite,
-13-
LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 crocidolite, tremolite, anthrophyllite, actinolite, or any combination
2 thereof, shall be commenced within four years after the injured person
3 has been informed of discovery of the injury by competent medical
4 authority and that such injury was caused by exposure to asbestos as
5 described herein, or within four years after the discovery of facts which
6 would reasonably lead to such discovery, whichever is earlier.
7 (b) No action commenced under this subsection based on the doctrine
8 of strict liability in tort shall be commenced or maintained against any
9 seller of a product which is alleged to contain or possess a defective
10 condition unreasonably dangerous to the buyer, user, or consumer unless
11 such seller is also the manufacturer of such product or the manufacturer
12 of the part thereof claimed to be defective.
13 (c) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit an
14 action to be brought based on an injury described in this subsection
15 discovered more than two years prior to August 30, 1981.
16 (d) The period of limitations for an asbestos action as defined in
17 the Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming Reform Act for any non-
18 malignant asbestos-related condition that is not barred as of the
19 effective date of this act shall be tolled until the date the exposed
20 person receives or reasonably could have received a diagnosis of
21 asbestos-related impairment sufficient to satisfy the prima facie
22 evidence requirements of the act or the exposed person's date of death,
23 whichever is earlier.
24 Sec. 19. Original section 25-224, Reissue Revised Statutes of
25 Nebraska, is repealed.

LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA
ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE BILL 340
Introduced by Hallstrom, 1.
Read first time January 16, 2025
Committee: Judiciary
1 A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to asbestos; to amend section 25-224, Reissue
2 Revised Statutes of Nebraska; to adopt the Asbestos Trust Claims
3 Transparency Act and the Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming
4 Reform Act; to change provisions relating to a statute of
5 limitations; and to repeal the original section.
6 Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
-1-

LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 7 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Asbestos Trust Claims Transparency Act.
3 Sec. 2. For purposes of the Asbestos Trust Claims Transparency Act:
4 (1) Asbestos action means a civil action arising out of, based on,
5 or related to the health effects of exposure to asbestos and any
6 derivative claim made by or on behalf of a person exposed to asbestos or
7 a representative, spouse, parent, child, or other relative of such
8 person;
9 (2) Asbestos trust means a government-approved or court-approved
10 trust, qualified settlement fund, compensation fund, or claims facility
11 that is:
12 (a) Created as a result of an administrative or legal action, a
13 court-approved bankruptcy, or pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 524(g) or 11 U.S.C.
14 1121(a) or other applicable provision of law; and
15 (b) Intended to provide compensation for claims arising out of,
16 based on, or related to the health effects of exposure to asbestos;
17 (3) Trust claim materials means a final executed proof of claim and
18 documents or information submitted to or received from an asbestos trust,
19 including:
20 (a) Claim forms and supplementary materials, proofs of claim,
21 affidavits, depositions, medical and health records, trial testimony,
22 work history, and exposure allegations; and
23 (b) Documents that reflect the status of a claim against an asbestos
24 trust and, if the trust claim has been resolved, documents relating to
25 the resolution of the trust claim; and
26 (4) Trust governance documents means documents that relate to
27 eligibility and payment levels for an asbestos trust, including claims
28 payment matrices, trust distribution procedures, or plans for
29 reorganization.
30 Sec. 3. (1) Within thirty days after filing an asbestos action, the
31 claimant shall submit all available asbestos trust claims, produce all
-2-

LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 trust claims materials, and file and provide all parties with an
2 affidavit indicating that all asbestos trust claims that can be made by
3 the claimant have been filed and that all trust claims materials produced
4 by the claimant are true and complete. A deferral or placeholder claim
5 that is missing necessary documentation for the asbestos trust to pay the
6 claim does not meet the requirements of this section. The claimant shall
7 produce all trust claims filed by a person other than the claimant if the
8 asbestos action is based on exposure to asbestos through that person and
9 the materials are available to the claimant or claimant's counsel.
10 (2) A claimant shall supplement the information and materials
11 required under subsection (1) of this section after supplementing an
12 asbestos trust claim, receiving additional information or materials
13 related to an asbestos trust claim, or filing an additional trust claim.
14 Sec. 4. (1) Not less than sixty days before trial of an asbestos
15 action, if a defendant believes the claimant has not filed all asbestos
16 trust claims as required by section 3 of this act, the defendant may move
17 the court for an order to require the claimant to file the additional
18 trust claims the defendant believes the claimant is eligible to file.
19 (2) If the court determines there is a sufficient basis for the
20 claimant to file an asbestos trust claim identified by the defendant, the
21 court shall order the claimant to file the asbestos trust claim, produce
22 all related trust claim materials, and produce an affidavit stating that
23 all such materials are true and complete. The court shall not set the
24 asbestos action for trial earlier than ninety days after the claimant
25 complies with this section.
26 Sec. 5. (1) Trust claim materials and trust governance documents
27 are admissible as evidence in an asbestos action and are presumed to be
28 relevant and authentic. No claims of privilege apply to trust claim
29 materials or trust governance documents.
30 (2) A defendant in an asbestos action may seek discovery from an
31 asbestos trust. The claimant may not claim privilege or confidentiality
-3-

LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 to bar discovery and shall provide consent or other expression of
2 permission that may be required by the asbestos trust to release
3 information and materials sought by a defendant.
4 Sec. 6. In an asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
5 setoffs are permitted under applicable law, a defendant is entitled to a
6 setoff in the amount the claimant has received from an asbestos trust
7 and, for trust claims not yet paid as of the date of entry of judgment,
8 the amount the claimant will receive as specified in the applicable trust
9 governance documents. If multiple defendants are found liable for
10 damages, the court shall distribute the amount of setoff proportionally
11 between the defendants, according to the liability of each defendant.
12 Sec. 7. The Asbestos Trust Claims Transparency Act applies to
13 asbestos actions filed on or after the effective date of this act.
14 Sec. 8. Sections 8 to 17 of this act shall be known and may be
15 cited as the Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming Reform Act.

LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 diffuse pleural thickening;
2 (2) A detailed occupational and exposure history from the exposed
3 person or, if that person is deceased, from the person most knowledgeable

5 exposed person's places of employment and exposures to airborne
6 contaminants and whether each place of employment involved exposures to
7 airborne contaminants, including asbestos fibers or other disease-causing
8 dusts, that may cause pulmonary impairment, and the nature, duration, and
9 level of any exposure;
10 (3) A detailed medical, social, and smoking history from the exposed
11 person or, if that person is deceased, from the person most
12 knowledgeable, including a thorough review of the past and present
13 medical problems of the exposed person;
14 (4) Evidence verifying that at least fifteen years have elapsed
15 between the exposed person's date of first exposure to asbestos and the
16 date of diagnosis;
17 (5) Evidence that the exposed person has, or the deceased person
18 had, a permanent respiratory impairment rating of at least Class 2 as
19 defined by and evaluated in accordance with the AMA Guides;
20 (6) Evidence that asbestosis or diffuse bilateral pleural
21 thickening, rather than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a
22 substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's physical
23 impairment, based on a determination the exposed person has any of the
24 following:
25 (a) FVC below the predicted lower limit of normal and FEV1/FVC ratio
26 (using actual values) equal to or above the predicted lower limit of
27 normal;
28 (b) Total lung capacity, by plethysmography or timed gas dilution,
29 below the predicted lower limit of normal; or
30 (c) A chest X-ray showing bilateral small, irregular opacities (s,
31 t, or u) graded by a certified B Reader as at least 2/1 on the ILO
-10-

LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 system; and
2 (7) A statement from the qualified physician that exposure to
3 asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's
4 physical impairment and that such physical impairment was likely not the
5 result of other causes. A statement from the qualified physician that the
6 exposed person's physical impairment is "consistent with exposure to
7 asbestos" or "compatible with exposure to asbestos", or words to that
8 effect, shall not satisfy this section.
9 Sec. 13. (1) To make the prima facie showing required by section 11
10 of this act in an asbestos action related to an alleged asbestos-related
11 malignant condition, the detailed narrative medical report signed by a
12 qualified physician with supporting test results shall include the
13 following:
14 (a) A diagnosis that the exposed person has a malignant asbestos-
15 related condition; and
16 (b) A statement from the qualified physician that exposure to
17 asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's
18 malignant condition and not the result of other causes, and a detailed
19 explanation for that opinion. A statement from the qualified physician
20 that the malignant condition is "consistent with exposure to asbestos" or
21 "compatible with exposure to asbestos", or words to that effect, shall
22 not satisfy this section.
23 (2) The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing and determine if the
24 exposed person has established a prima facie showing of a malignant
25 condition for which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing
26 factor.
27 Sec. 14. (1) Evidence relating to the prima facie showings required
28 under the Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming Reform Act does not
29 create a presumption the exposed person has an asbestos-related
30 impairment and is not conclusive as to the liability of any defendant.
31 (2) Evidence shall not be offered at trial and the jury shall not be
-11-

LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 informed of:
2 (a) The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss an asbestos action
3 under the act; or
4 (b) The provisions of the act with respect to what constitutes a
5 prima facie showing of asbestos impairment.
6 (3) Evidence relating to physical impairment offered in an asbestos
7 action:
8 (a) Must comply with the quality controls, equipment requirements,
9 methods of calibration, and techniques set forth in the AMA Guides and
10 official technical statements of the American Thoracic Society;
11 (b) Shall not be based on testing or examinations that violate a
12 law, regulation, licensing requirement, or medical code of practice of
13 this state or of the state in which the examination or test was
14 conducted; and
15 (c) Shall not be obtained under the condition the exposed person
16 retains the services of an attorney or law firm.
17 Sec. 15. Until a court enters an order determining that the exposed
18 person has established prima facie evidence of impairment, an asbestos
19 action is not subject to discovery, except discovery related to
20 establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence.
21 Sec. 16. A court may consolidate for trial any number and type of
22 asbestos actions with the consent of all parties. In the absence of such
23 consent, the court may consolidate for trial only asbestos actions
24 relating to the exposed person and members of that person's household.
25 Sec. 17. The Asbestos Claims Priorities and Over-Naming Reform Act
26 applies to asbestos actions filed on or after the effective date of this
27 act.
28 Sec. 18. Section 25-224, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 25-224 (1) All product liability actions, except one governed by
31 subsection (5) of this section, shall be commenced within four years next
-12-

LB340 LB340
2025 2025
1 after the date on which the death, injury, or damage complained of
2 occurs.
3 (2)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section or any other
4 statutory provision to the contrary, any product liability action, except
5 one governed by section 2-725, Uniform Commercial Code or by subsection
6 (5) of this section, shall be commenced as follows:
7 (i) For products manufactured in Nebraska, within ten years after
8 the date the product which allegedly caused the personal injury, death,
9 or damage was first sold or leased for use or consumption; or
10 (ii) For products manufactured outside Nebraska, within the time
11 allowed by the applicable statute of repose, if any, of the state or
12 country where the product was manufactured, but in no event less than ten
13 years. If the state or country where the product was manufactured does
14 not have an applicable statute of repose, then the only limitation upon
15 the commencement of an action for product liability shall be as set forth
16 in subsection (1) of this section.
17 (b) If the changes made to this subsection by Laws 2001, LB 489, are
18 declared invalid or unconstitutional, this subsection as it existed prior
19 to September 1, 2001, shall be deemed in full force and effect and shall
20 apply to all claims in which a final order has not been entered.
21 (3) The limitations contained in subsection (1), (2), or (5) of this
22 section shall not be applicable to indemnity or contribution actions
