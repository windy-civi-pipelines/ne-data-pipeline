Sec. 2. Section 81-885.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
81-885.02 (1) After September 2, 1973, it shall be unlawful for any
person, directly or indirectly, to engage in or conduct, or to advertise or
hold himself or herself out as engaging in or conducting the business, or
acting in the capacity, of a real estate broker, associate broker, or real
estate salesperson within this state without first obtaining a license as such
broker, associate broker, or salesperson, as provided in the Nebraska Real
Estate License Act, unless he or she is exempted from obtaining a license under
section 81-885.04.
(2) For purposes of this section, acting as a real estate broker,
associate broker, or real estate salesperson includes publicly marketing for
sale an equitable interest in a contract for the purchase of real property,
other than a vacant lot, between a property owner and a prospective purchaser.
Sec. 3. Section 81-885.13, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
81-885.13 (1)(a) No broker's or salesperson's license shall be issued to
any person who has not attained the age of nineteen years.
(b) No broker's or salesperson's license shall be issued to any person who
is not a graduate of a public or private high school or the holder of a
certificate of high school equivalency. This subdivision does not apply to: (i)
A person who is a graduate of a school exempt from the State Department of
Education requirements under section 79-1601 or an equivalent exempt school or
home school program from another jurisdiction; or (ii) a person who has
completed a program of education acceptable to the commission.
(2) Each applicant for a salesperson's license shall furnish evidence that
he or she has completed three two courses in real estate subjects, approved by
the commission, composed of not less than ninety sixty class hours of study in
total or, in lieu thereof, courses delivered in a distance education format
approved by the commission. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations specifying the mandatory subject matter for the courses required
under this subsection.
(3) Each applicant for a broker's license shall either:
(a) Have first served actively for two years as a licensed salesperson or
broker and shall furnish evidence of completion of sixty class hours in
addition to the hours required by subsection (2) of this section in a course of
study approved by the commission or, in lieu thereof, courses delivered in a
distance education format approved by the commission; or
(b) Upon special application and hearing before the commission, provide
satisfactory evidence of hardship due to an existing brokerage being unable to
retain the services of a licensee to act as its designated broker who has the
two years' experience required in this subsection. Any applicant so approved
shall must furnish a certificate that he or she has passed a course of at least
eighteen credit hours in subjects related to real estate at an accredited
university or college, or completed six courses in real estate subjects
composed of not less than one hundred eighty class hours in total in a course
of study approved by the commission or, in lieu thereof, courses delivered in a
distance education format approved by the commission.
(4) No person issued a broker's license may act as a designated broker for
any other licensee until such person has taken additional courses of
postlicensure education in the subjects of real estate trust accounting,
brokerage finance, business ethics, and risk management, except that the
commission may extend, for up to six months, the postlicensure course work
requirement under the hardship provision of subdivision (3)(b) of this section.
(5) Each applicant for a broker's or salesperson's license shall furnish
evidence of completion of six class hours of study in a course approved by the
commission related to professional practice and standards.
(6) Each applicant for a broker's license shall must pass a written
examination covering generally the matters confronting real estate brokers, and
each applicant for a salesperson's license shall must pass a written
examination covering generally the matters confronting real estate
salespersons. Such examination may be taken before the commission or any person
designated by the commission. Failure to pass the examination shall be grounds
for denial of a license without further hearing. Within thirty days after
passing the examination the applicant shall must complete all requirements
necessary for the issuance of a license. The commission may prepare and
distribute to licensees under the Nebraska Real Estate License Act
informational material deemed of assistance in the conduct of their business.
(7) An applicant for an original broker's or salesperson's license shall
be subject to fingerprinting and a check of his or her criminal history record
information maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation through the
Nebraska State Patrol. After filing application for a license, each applicant
shall furnish directly to the Nebraska State Patrol, or to a fingerprint
processing service that may be selected by the commission for this purpose, a
full set of fingerprints to enable a criminal background investigation to be
conducted. The applicant shall request that the Nebraska State Patrol submit
the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal
history record check. The applicant shall pay the actual cost, if any, of the
fingerprinting and check of his or her criminal history record information. The
applicant shall authorize release of the national criminal history record check
to the commission.
