LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 249
Introduced by Cavanaugh, M., 6.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the feasibility and potential benefits of establishing a ways and means
committee to enhance coordination and collaboration between the Revenue
Committee of the Legislature and the Appropriations Committee of the
Legislature, in order to create a more integrated and balanced approach to the
state's budgeting process.
The study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Examining the current roles and responsibilities of the Revenue
Committee of the Legislature and the Appropriations Committee of the
Legislature, including areas of jurisdictional overlap and how these affect the
efficiency and transparency of the budget process;
(2) Examining the timing and alignment of revenue forecasting and budget
setting processes, including the interaction between the Nebraska Economic
Forecasting Advisory Board's schedule and the legislative appropriations
timeline;
(3) Studying best practices from other states and governmental bodies,
particularly those with a functioning ways and means committee or equivalent
structures that integrate tax policy, revenue forecasting, and appropriations
oversight;
(4) Determining potential duties and scope of a ways and means committee,
including recommendations on how such a body could improve coordination, policy
alignment, and strategic planning in budget matters;
(5) Examining opportunities to improve procedures related to revenue
estimation, budget development, and legislative oversight of appropriations;
