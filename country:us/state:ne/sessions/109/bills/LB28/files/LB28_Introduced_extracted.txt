6 (a)(i) There shall be subtracted interest or dividends received by
7 the owner of obligations of the United States and its territories and

9 United States to the extent includable in gross income for federal income
10 tax purposes but exempt from state income taxes under the laws of the

21 (c) There shall be added interest or dividends received by the owner
22 of obligations of the District of Columbia, other states of the United
23 States, or their political subdivisions, authorities, commissions, or

1 the recipient by the regulated investment company; and
2 (e)(i) Any amount subtracted under this subsection shall be reduced
3 by any interest on indebtedness incurred to carry the obligations or
4 securities described in this subsection or the investment in the
5 regulated investment company and by any expenses incurred in the
6 production of interest or dividend income described in this subsection to
7 the extent that such expenses, including amortizable bond premiums, are
8 deductible in determining federal taxable income.
9 (ii) Any amount added under this subsection shall be reduced by any

11 disallowed in the computation of federal taxable income.
12 (2) There shall be allowed a net operating loss derived from or

14 adopted and promulgated by the Tax Commissioner consistent, to the extent
15 possible under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, with the laws of the

14 rate for corporations. The taxpayer may make the computation for each
15 foreign country or for groups of foreign countries. The portion of the
