3 retirement system to provide benefits for the affected plan members
4 incurred by the retirement system due to the entity's business
5 transaction calculated using the methodology and assumptions recommended
6 by the board's contracted actuary and approved by the board. The
7 methodology and assumptions used must be structured in a way that ensures

9 business transaction, and the retirement system is not financially liable
10 for any of the cost of the entity's business transaction.
11 (e) The board may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
12 carry out this subsection including, but not limited to, the methods of
13 notifying the board of pending business transactions, the acceptable

16 time employee may apply to the board for vesting credit for years of

19 participation in the other Nebraska governmental plan, the employee must
20 have been a full-time employee, as defined in the Nebraska governmental
21 plan in which the credit was earned. The board may adopt and promulgate
22 rules and regulations governing the assessment and granting of vesting
23 credit.
24 (6) Any employee who qualifies for membership in the retirement
25 system pursuant to this section may not be disqualified from membership
26 in the retirement system solely because such employee also maintains
27 separate employment which qualifies the employee for membership in
28 another public retirement system, nor may membership in this retirement
29 system disqualify such an employee from membership in another public
30 retirement system solely by reason of separate employment which qualifies
31 such employee for membership in this retirement system.

24 in this section, a member of the retirement system who has a five-year
25 break in service shall upon reemployment be considered a new employee
26 with respect to the County Employees Retirement Act and shall not receive

6 termination benefit pursuant to section 23-2319, the years of

8 limited in a ratio equal to the amount that the member repays divided by

11 the value of, the termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section
12 23-2319. A reemployed member who elects to repay all or a portion of the
13 value of the termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319
14 shall repay the actual earnings on such value. Repayment of the
15 termination benefit shall commence within three years of reemployment and
16 shall be completed within five years of reemployment or prior to
17 termination of employment, whichever occurs first, through (i) direct
18 payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment payments made
19 pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization made by
20 the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under the
21 Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in
22 accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code.
23 (c) The value of the member's forfeited employer account or employer
24 cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be restored in
25 a ratio equal to the amount of the benefit that the member has repaid
26 divided by the termination benefit received. The employer account or
27 employer cash balance account shall be restored first out of the current
28 forfeiture amounts and then by additional employer contributions.

1 twenty days after his or her retirement date, the member shall continue
2 receiving retirement benefits. Such a retired member or a retired member
3 who received a lump-sum distribution of his or her benefit shall be
4 considered a new employee as of the date of reemployment and shall not
5 receive credit for any service prior to the member's retirement for
6 purposes of the act.
7 (4) A member who is reinstated as an employee pursuant to a
8 grievance or appeal of his or her termination by the county shall be a
9 member upon reemployment and shall not be considered to have a break in
10 service for such period of time that the grievance or appeal was pending.
11 (5) Beginning January 1, 2020, if a contributing member of the
12 retirement system ceases to be an employee and returns to service in any
13 capacity with any county under the County Employees Retirement Act prior
14 to having a one-hundred-twenty-day break in service, the member:
15 (a) Shall not be deemed to have had a bona fide separation of
16 service;
17 (b) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
18 (i) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing
19 to the defined contribution benefit prior to ceasing employment; or
20 (ii) The cash balance benefit in which the member was participating
21 prior to ceasing employment if the member was contributing to the cash
22 balance benefit prior to ceasing employment;
23 (c) Shall immediately resume making contributions;
24 (d) Shall make up any missed contributions based upon services
25 rendered and compensation received;
26 (e) Shall have all distributions from the retirement system
27 canceled; and

29 unless the board determines that all or any portion of such gross
30 distributions were the result of an inadvertent benefit overpayment and
31 repayment of such gross distributions would create a significant
-19-

2025 2025
1 hardship.
2 (6)(a) Beginning January 1, 2020, if a contributing member of the
3 retirement system ceases to be an employee and returns to permanent full-
4 time or permanent part-time service in any capacity with any county under
5 the County Employees Retirement Act after having a one-hundred-twenty-day
6 break in service, the member:

15 ceased employment and before the member was reemployed; and

19 (b) For the purposes of vesting employer contributions made prior to
20 and after reentry into the retirement system, the member's years of
21 participation prior to the date the member originally ceased employment
22 and the years of participation after the member is reenrolled in the
23 retirement system shall be included as years of participation, except
24 that if the member is not vested on the date the member originally ceased
25 employment and has taken a distribution, the years of participation prior
26 to the date the member originally ceased employment shall be limited in a
27 ratio equal to the value of the distribution that the member repays
28 divided by the total value of the distribution taken as described in
29 subdivision (6)(c) of this section.
30 (c) A reemployed member may repay all or a portion of the value of a
31 distribution except for an annuity elected after the member ceased
-20-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 employment and before the member was reemployed. Repayment of such a
2 distribution shall commence within three years after reemployment and
3 shall be completed within five years after reemployment or prior to the
4 member again ceasing employment, whichever occurs first, through (i)
5 direct payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment payments made
6 pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization made by
7 the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under the
8 Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in
9 accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the
10 member fails to repay all of the value of such a distribution prior to
11 the member again ceasing employment, the member shall be forever barred
12 from repaying the value of such a distribution taken between the periods
13 of employment. The value of the member's forfeited employer account or
14 employer cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be
15 restored in a ratio equal to the amount of the distribution repaid by the
16 member divided by the amount of the distribution taken. The employer
17 account or employer cash balance account shall be restored first out of
18 the current forfeiture amounts and then by additional employer
19 contributions.

2 (5)(a) Prior to July 1, 2021:
3 (i) Beginning July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, the
4 board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed that will
5 value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
6 required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
7 actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
8 recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with
9 the board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
10 the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate,
11 plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial
12 accrued liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
13 under this method shall be determined for each individual member on a
14 level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount is then summed
15 for all members;
16 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall
17 be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period, and during each
18 subsequent actuarial valuation through June 30, 2021, changes in the
19 unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits,
20 actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or
21 losses shall be measured and amortized over a thirty-year period
22 beginning on the valuation date of such change;
23 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
24 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
25 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
26 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
27 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period
28 as of the actuarial valuation date; and
29 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
30 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
31 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
-32-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
2 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act.
3 (b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
4 (i) The board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be
5 performed that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the

7 shall perform an actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of
8 actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved by the board,
9 and kept on file with the board using the entry age actuarial cost
10 method. Under such method, the actuarially required funding rate is equal
11 to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize
12 the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of salary
13 basis. The normal cost under such method shall be determined for each
14 individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
15 amount is then summed for all members;
16 (ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
17 changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method,
18 or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a
19 twenty-five-year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
20 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
21 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
22 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
23 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
24 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a twenty-five-year
25 period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
26 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
27 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
28 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
29 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
30 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the act.
31 (c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and after
-33-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025

2 Legislature, the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases
3 to reduce future volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such
4 notification to the committee shall be in writing and include, at a
5 minimum, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the plan
6 if the combination or offset were not implemented, the actuary's
7 projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or
8 offset were implemented, and the actuary's explanation of why the
9 combination or offset is in the best interests of the plan at the
10 proposed time.
11 (d) For purposes of this subsection, the rate of all contributions
12 required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act includes (i) member
13 contributions, (ii) state contributions pursuant to subsection (6) of
14 this section which shall be considered as a contribution for the plan
15 year ending the prior June 30, (iii) court fees as provided in subsection
16 (3) of this section, and (iv) all fees pursuant to sections 25-2804,
17 33-103, 33-103.01, 33-106.02, 33-123, 33-124, 33-125, 33-126.02,
18 33-126.03, and 33-126.06, as directed to be remitted to the fund.
19 (6)(a) In addition to the contributions otherwise required by this

21 the state shall contribute or as soon thereafter as administratively
22 possible, the State Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund to the
23 Nebraska Retirement Fund for Judges an amount equal to five percent of
24 the total annual compensation of all members of the retirement system
25 except as otherwise provided in this subsection and as such rate shall be
26 adjusted or terminated by the Legislature. No adjustment may cause the
27 total contribution rate established in this subsection to exceed five
28 percent. For purposes of this subsection, (i) total annual compensation
29 is based on the total member compensation reported in the most recent
30 annual actuarial valuation report for the retirement system produced for
31 the board pursuant to section 84-1503 and (ii) the contribution described
-34-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025

2 year ending the prior June 30.
3 (b) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is at or
4 above one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
5 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
6 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
7 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
8 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
9 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
10 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
11 annual actuarial valuation report.
12 (c) If the state contribution rate has been adjusted to less than
13 five percent and the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is
14 below one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
15 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
16 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
17 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
18 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
19 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
20 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
21 annual actuarial valuation report.
22 (d) If an annual actuarial valuation report includes a
23 recommendation from the actuary to adjust the contribution rate as
24 described in subdivision (b) or (c) of this subsection, the board shall
25 provide written notice electronically to the Nebraska Retirement Systems
26 Committee of the Legislature, to the Governor, and to the Supreme Court
27 of such recommendation within seven business days after voting to approve
28 an annual actuarial valuation report. The notice shall include the
29 actuary's recommendation and analysis regarding such adjustment.

7 contributions pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code
8 in determining federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be
9 included as gross income of the member until such time as they are
10 distributed or made available. The contributions, although designated as
11 member contributions, shall be paid by the state or county in lieu of
12 member contributions. The state or county shall pay these member
13 contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying
14 earnings to the member. The state or county shall pick up these
15 contributions by a compensation deduction through a reduction in the
16 compensation of the member. Member contributions picked up shall be
17 treated for all purposes of the Judges Retirement Act in the same manner
18 and to the extent as member contributions made prior to the date picked

26 thereafter, for employees of Class V school districts who became members
27 on or after July 1, 2013, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be made for
28 any formula annuity being paid pursuant to the act and on which the first
29 payment was dated on or before October 3 preceding such January 1
30 adjustment date. The cost-of-living adjustment for any such annuity shall
31 be the lesser of (a) one percent or (b) the increase in the consumer
-70-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 price index from the date such annuity first became payable through the
2 August 31 preceding the January 1 adjustment date as reduced by the
3 aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to the annuity
4 pursuant to this section.
5 (10) Beginning September 1, 1999, the actuary shall make an annual
6 valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system. If the annual
7 valuation made by the actuary, as approved by the board of trustees,
8 indicates that the system has sufficient actuarial surplus to provide for
9 a cost-of-living adjustment in addition to the adjustment made pursuant
10 to subsection (8) or (9) of this section, the board of trustees may, in
11 its discretion, declare by resolution that each annuity being paid
12 pursuant to the act, or pursuant to the provisions of the retirement
13 system established by statute for employees of Class V school districts
14 in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the first payment was
15 dated on or before October 3 of the year such resolution is adopted,
16 shall be increased beginning as of the January 1 following the date of
17 the board of trustees' resolution by such percentage as may be declared
18 by the board of trustees, except that such increase for any such annuity
19 shall not exceed the increase in the consumer price index from the date
20 such annuity first became payable through the applicable valuation date
21 as reduced by the aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to
22 the annuity pursuant to this section.
23 (11) Except for the adjustments pursuant to subsection (13) of this
24 section, the consumer price index to be used for determining any cost-of-
25 living adjustment under this section shall be the Consumer Price Index -
26 All Urban Consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
27 the United States Department of Labor. If this consumer price index is
28 discontinued or replaced, a substitute index published by the United
29 States Department of Labor shall be selected by the board if before
30 September 1, 2024, or by the retirement board if on or after September 1,
31 2024. Any substitute index selected shall be a reasonable representative
-71-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 measurement of the cost of living for retired employees. An annuity as
2 increased by any cost-of-living adjustment made under this section shall
3 be considered the base annuity amount for the purpose of future
4 adjustments pursuant to this section. In no event shall any cost-of-
5 living adjustment be deemed to affect or increase the amount of the base
6 retirement annuity of a member as determined under section 79-999 or
7 79-9,100.
8 (12) Any decision or determination by the board or retirement board,
9 as applicable, (a) to declare or not declare a cost-of-living adjustment,
10 (b) as to whether the annual valuation indicates a sufficient actuarial
11 surplus to provide for a cost-of-living adjustment, or (c) pursuant to
12 the selection of a substitute index shall be made in the sole, absolute,
13 and final discretion of the board or retirement board, as applicable, and
14 shall not be subject to challenge by any member or beneficiary. In no
15 event shall the Legislature be constrained or limited in amending the
16 system or increasing the benefits of members under the system, nor shall
17 the board or retirement board, as applicable, be constrained from
18 supporting any such change to the system, notwithstanding the effect of
19 any such change upon the actuarial surplus of the system and the ability
20 of the board or retirement board, as applicable, to declare future cost-
21 of-living adjustments.
22 (13) The Legislature finds and declares that there exists in this
23 state a pressing need to attract and retain qualified and dedicated
24 public school employees and that one of the factors prospective public
25 school employees consider when seeking or continuing public school
26 employment is the retirement system and benefits the employment provides.
27 The Legislature further finds that over the past decades, as reflected by
28 the Medical Price Index published by the United States Department of
29 Labor, the cost of medical care, including the cost of medications and
30 insurance coverages, has increased at a rate in excess of that by which
31 the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers has increased. The
-72-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 Legislature further finds and declares that there accordingly exists a
2 need to adjust the amount of retirement benefits paid to retired public
3 school employees in order to assist them in meeting the increased cost of
4 medical care. Therefor, in addition to the cost-of-living adjustments
5 provided in subsections (1) through (12) of this section, commencing on
6 October 3, 2001, and on October 3 of every year thereafter, a medical
7 cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid to any annuitant who became a
8 member prior to July 1, 2016, and has been paid an annuity from the
9 retirement system for at least ten years through the October 3 adjustment
10 date. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid in the form of a
11 supplemental annuity providing monthly payments equal to the amount which
12 results when (a) the fraction, not to exceed one, that results when the
13 annuitant's years of creditable service at his or her retirement date is
14 divided by twenty, is multiplied by (b) the product of ten dollars times
15 the number of years, including attained one-half years, that such
16 annuitant has received annuity payments from the retirement system
17 through the October 3 adjustment date. The supplemental annuity being
18 paid to an annuitant shall increase by ten dollars on October 3 of each
19 subsequent year to reflect the additional year of annuity payments to the
20 annuitant until the total amount of the supplemental annuity is two
21 hundred fifty dollars. In no event shall the medical cost-of-living
22 adjustment for any annuitant pursuant to this subsection result in the
23 payment of a supplemental annuity exceeding two hundred fifty dollars per
24 month. The supplemental annuity paid to an annuitant pursuant to this
25 subsection shall cease at the death of the annuitant regardless of the
26 form of retirement annuity being paid to the annuitant at the time of his
27 or her death.
28 Sec. 15. Section 79-9,106, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 79-9,106 (1) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and
31 who has twenty years or more of creditable service, the member's primary
-73-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 beneficiary, as designated by the member in writing on forms provided by
2 the system, shall receive a survivorship annuity in accordance with
3 subdivision (1) of section 79-9,101 if the primary beneficiary is (a) the
4 member's spouse or (b) one other designated beneficiary whose attained
5 age in the calendar year of the member's death is no more than ten years
6 less than the attained age of the member in such calendar year. The
7 amount of such actuarially equivalent annuity shall be calculated using
8 the attained ages of the member and the beneficiary and be based on the
9 annuity earned to the date of the member's death without reduction due to
10 any early commencement of benefits. Within ninety sixty days from the
11 date of the member's death, if the member has not previously filed with
12 the administrator of the retirement system a form requiring that only the
13 survivorship annuity be paid, the beneficiary may request to receive in a
14 lump sum an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions. If
15 prior to the member's death, the member files with the administrator of
16 the retirement system a form requiring that the beneficiary receive a
17 lump-sum settlement in lieu of the survivorship annuity, the beneficiary
18 shall receive, in lieu of the survivorship annuity, a lump-sum settlement
19 in an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions
20 notwithstanding any other provision of this section.
21 (2) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and who has
22 less than twenty years of creditable service or upon the death of a
23 member who has not yet retired and who has twenty years or more of
24 creditable service but whose beneficiary does not meet the criteria in
25 subsection (1) of this section, a lump sum in an amount equal to the
26 member's accumulated contributions shall be paid pursuant to section
27 79-9,119.
28 (3) A lump-sum death benefit paid pursuant to subsection (1) or (2)
29 of this section, other than the member's estate, that is an eligible
30 distribution may be distributed in the form of a direct transfer to a
31 retirement plan eligible to receive such transfer under the provisions of
-74-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 the Internal Revenue Code.
2 (4) For any member whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2007,
3 while performing qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)
4 of the Internal Revenue Code, the member's beneficiary shall be entitled
5 to any additional death benefit that would have been provided, other than
6 the accrual of any benefit relating to the period of qualified military
7 service. The additional death benefit shall be determined as if the
8 member had returned to employment with the school district and such
9 employment had terminated on the date of the member's death.
10 Sec. 16. Section 79-9,117, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 79-9,117 (1)(a) Until September 1, 2024, the board of trustees shall
13 establish a comprehensive preretirement planning program for school
14 employees who are members of the retirement system. The program shall
15 provide information and advice regarding the many changes members face
16 upon retirement, including, but not limited to, changes in physical and
17 mental health, housing, family life, leisure activity, and retirement
18 income.
19 (b) Beginning September 1, 2024, the retirement board shall
20 establish sessions as provided in section 84-1511 for school employees
21 who are members of the retirement system.

23 members.
24 (3) The preretirement planning program shall include information on
25 the federal and state income tax consequences of the various annuity or
26 retirement benefit options available to the member, information on social
27 security benefits, information on various local, state, and federal
28 government programs and programs in the private sector designed to assist
29 elderly persons, and information and advice the board of trustees or
30 retirement board, as applicable, deems valuable in assisting members in
31 the transition from public employment to retirement.
-75-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 (4) The board of trustees or retirement board, as applicable, shall
2 work with any governmental agency, including political subdivisions or
3 bodies whose services or expertise may enhance the development or
4 implementation of the preretirement planning program.
5 (5) The costs of the preretirement planning program shall be charged
6 back to the retirement system.
7 (6) An employer shall provide each member leave with pay to attend
8 up to two preretirement planning programs or the equivalent of up to
9 sixteen hours of preretirement planning programs. For purposes of this
10 subsection, leave with pay means a day off paid by an employer and does
11 not mean vacation, sick, personal, or compensatory time. A member may
12 choose to attend a program more than twice, but such leave shall be at

31 distribution except for an annuity elected after the member ceased

16 member divided by the amount of the distribution taken. The employer

19 contributions.

2 (5)(a) Prior to July 1, 2021:
3 (i) Beginning July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, the
4 board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed that will
5 value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
6 required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
7 actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
8 recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with
9 the board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
10 the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate,
11 plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial
12 accrued liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
13 under this method shall be determined for each individual member on a
14 level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount is then summed
15 for all members;
16 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall
17 be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period, and during each
18 subsequent actuarial valuation through June 30, 2021, changes in the
19 unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits,
20 actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or
21 losses shall be measured and amortized over a thirty-year period
22 beginning on the valuation date of such change;
23 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
24 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
25 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
26 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
27 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period
28 as of the actuarial valuation date; and
29 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
30 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
31 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
-32-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
2 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act.
3 (b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
4 (i) The board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be
5 performed that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the
6 contributions required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board
7 shall perform an actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of
8 actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved by the board,
9 and kept on file with the board using the entry age actuarial cost
10 method. Under such method, the actuarially required funding rate is equal
11 to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize
12 the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of salary
13 basis. The normal cost under such method shall be determined for each
14 individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
15 amount is then summed for all members;
16 (ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
17 changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method,
18 or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a
19 twenty-five-year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
20 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
21 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
22 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
23 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
24 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a twenty-five-year
25 period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
26 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
27 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
28 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
29 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
30 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the act.
31 (c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and after
-33-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 the board notifies the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of the
2 Legislature, the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases
3 to reduce future volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such
4 notification to the committee shall be in writing and include, at a
5 minimum, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the plan
6 if the combination or offset were not implemented, the actuary's
7 projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or
8 offset were implemented, and the actuary's explanation of why the
9 combination or offset is in the best interests of the plan at the
10 proposed time.
11 (d) For purposes of this subsection, the rate of all contributions
12 required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act includes (i) member
13 contributions, (ii) state contributions pursuant to subsection (6) of
14 this section which shall be considered as a contribution for the plan
15 year ending the prior June 30, (iii) court fees as provided in subsection
16 (3) of this section, and (iv) all fees pursuant to sections 25-2804,
17 33-103, 33-103.01, 33-106.02, 33-123, 33-124, 33-125, 33-126.02,

19 (6)(a) In addition to the contributions otherwise required by this
20 section, beginning July 1, 2023, and on July 1 of each year thereafter,
21 the state shall contribute or as soon thereafter as administratively
22 possible, the State Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund to the
23 Nebraska Retirement Fund for Judges an amount equal to five percent of
24 the total annual compensation of all members of the retirement system
25 except as otherwise provided in this subsection and as such rate shall be
26 adjusted or terminated by the Legislature. No adjustment may cause the
27 total contribution rate established in this subsection to exceed five
28 percent. For purposes of this subsection, (i) total annual compensation
29 is based on the total member compensation reported in the most recent
30 annual actuarial valuation report for the retirement system produced for
31 the board pursuant to section 84-1503 and (ii) the contribution described
-34-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025

2 year ending the prior June 30.
3 (b) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is at or
4 above one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
5 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
6 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
7 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
8 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
9 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
10 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
11 annual actuarial valuation report.
12 (c) If the state contribution rate has been adjusted to less than
13 five percent and the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is
14 below one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
15 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
16 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
17 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
18 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
19 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
20 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
21 annual actuarial valuation report.
22 (d) If an annual actuarial valuation report includes a
23 recommendation from the actuary to adjust the contribution rate as
24 described in subdivision (b) or (c) of this subsection, the board shall
25 provide written notice electronically to the Nebraska Retirement Systems
26 Committee of the Legislature, to the Governor, and to the Supreme Court
27 of such recommendation within seven business days after voting to approve
28 an annual actuarial valuation report. The notice shall include the
29 actuary's recommendation and analysis regarding such adjustment.

7 contributions pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code
8 in determining federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be
9 included as gross income of the member until such time as they are
10 distributed or made available. The contributions, although designated as
11 member contributions, shall be paid by the state or county in lieu of
12 member contributions. The state or county shall pay these member
13 contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying
14 earnings to the member. The state or county shall pick up these
15 contributions by a compensation deduction through a reduction in the
16 compensation of the member. Member contributions picked up shall be
17 treated for all purposes of the Judges Retirement Act in the same manner
18 and to the extent as member contributions made prior to the date picked

2 increased by any cost-of-living adjustment made under this section shall
3 be considered the base annuity amount for the purpose of future
4 adjustments pursuant to this section. In no event shall any cost-of-
5 living adjustment be deemed to affect or increase the amount of the base

12 the selection of a substitute index shall be made in the sole, absolute,
13 and final discretion of the board or retirement board, as applicable, and
14 shall not be subject to challenge by any member or beneficiary. In no
15 event shall the Legislature be constrained or limited in amending the
16 system or increasing the benefits of members under the system, nor shall
17 the board or retirement board, as applicable, be constrained from
18 supporting any such change to the system, notwithstanding the effect of
19 any such change upon the actuarial surplus of the system and the ability
20 of the board or retirement board, as applicable, to declare future cost-
21 of-living adjustments.
22 (13) The Legislature finds and declares that there exists in this
23 state a pressing need to attract and retain qualified and dedicated
24 public school employees and that one of the factors prospective public
25 school employees consider when seeking or continuing public school
26 employment is the retirement system and benefits the employment provides.
27 The Legislature further finds that over the past decades, as reflected by
28 the Medical Price Index published by the United States Department of
29 Labor, the cost of medical care, including the cost of medications and
30 insurance coverages, has increased at a rate in excess of that by which
31 the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers has increased. The
-72-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 Legislature further finds and declares that there accordingly exists a
2 need to adjust the amount of retirement benefits paid to retired public
3 school employees in order to assist them in meeting the increased cost of
4 medical care. Therefor, in addition to the cost-of-living adjustments
5 provided in subsections (1) through (12) of this section, commencing on
6 October 3, 2001, and on October 3 of every year thereafter, a medical
7 cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid to any annuitant who became a
8 member prior to July 1, 2016, and has been paid an annuity from the
9 retirement system for at least ten years through the October 3 adjustment
10 date. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid in the form of a
11 supplemental annuity providing monthly payments equal to the amount which
12 results when (a) the fraction, not to exceed one, that results when the
13 annuitant's years of creditable service at his or her retirement date is
14 divided by twenty, is multiplied by (b) the product of ten dollars times
15 the number of years, including attained one-half years, that such
16 annuitant has received annuity payments from the retirement system
17 through the October 3 adjustment date. The supplemental annuity being
18 paid to an annuitant shall increase by ten dollars on October 3 of each
19 subsequent year to reflect the additional year of annuity payments to the
20 annuitant until the total amount of the supplemental annuity is two
21 hundred fifty dollars. In no event shall the medical cost-of-living
22 adjustment for any annuitant pursuant to this subsection result in the
23 payment of a supplemental annuity exceeding two hundred fifty dollars per
24 month. The supplemental annuity paid to an annuitant pursuant to this
25 subsection shall cease at the death of the annuitant regardless of the
26 form of retirement annuity being paid to the annuitant at the time of his
27 or her death.
28 Sec. 15. Section 79-9,106, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 79-9,106 (1) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and
31 who has twenty years or more of creditable service, the member's primary
-73-

2025 2025
1 beneficiary, as designated by the member in writing on forms provided by
2 the system, shall receive a survivorship annuity in accordance with
3 subdivision (1) of section 79-9,101 if the primary beneficiary is (a) the
4 member's spouse or (b) one other designated beneficiary whose attained
5 age in the calendar year of the member's death is no more than ten years
6 less than the attained age of the member in such calendar year. The
7 amount of such actuarially equivalent annuity shall be calculated using
8 the attained ages of the member and the beneficiary and be based on the
9 annuity earned to the date of the member's death without reduction due to
10 any early commencement of benefits. Within ninety sixty days from the
11 date of the member's death, if the member has not previously filed with
12 the administrator of the retirement system a form requiring that only the
13 survivorship annuity be paid, the beneficiary may request to receive in a
14 lump sum an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions. If
15 prior to the member's death, the member files with the administrator of
16 the retirement system a form requiring that the beneficiary receive a
17 lump-sum settlement in lieu of the survivorship annuity, the beneficiary
18 shall receive, in lieu of the survivorship annuity, a lump-sum settlement
19 in an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions
20 notwithstanding any other provision of this section.
21 (2) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and who has
22 less than twenty years of creditable service or upon the death of a
23 member who has not yet retired and who has twenty years or more of
24 creditable service but whose beneficiary does not meet the criteria in
25 subsection (1) of this section, a lump sum in an amount equal to the
26 member's accumulated contributions shall be paid pursuant to section
27 79-9,119.
28 (3) A lump-sum death benefit paid pursuant to subsection (1) or (2)
29 of this section, other than the member's estate, that is an eligible
30 distribution may be distributed in the form of a direct transfer to a
31 retirement plan eligible to receive such transfer under the provisions of

2 (4) For any member whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2007,
3 while performing qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)
4 of the Internal Revenue Code, the member's beneficiary shall be entitled
5 to any additional death benefit that would have been provided, other than
6 the accrual of any benefit relating to the period of qualified military
7 service. The additional death benefit shall be determined as if the
8 member had returned to employment with the school district and such

25 (6)(a) Beginning January 1, 2020, if a contributing member of the
26 retirement system ceases to be an employee and returns to permanent full-

13 and the years of participation after the member is reenrolled in the
14 retirement system shall be included as years of participation, except
15 that if the member is not vested on the date the member originally ceased
16 employment and has taken a distribution, the years of participation prior
17 to the date the member originally ceased employment shall be limited in a
18 ratio equal to the value of the distribution that the member repays
19 divided by the total value of the distribution taken as described in
20 subdivision (6)(c) of this section.
21 (c) A reemployed member may repay all or a portion of the value of a
22 distribution except for an annuity elected after the member ceased
23 employment and before the member was reemployed. Repayment of such a
24 distribution shall commence within three years after reemployment and
25 shall be completed within five years after reemployment or prior to the
26 member again ceasing employment, whichever occurs first, through (i)
27 direct payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment payments made
28 pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization made by
29 the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under the
30 Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in

7 member divided by the amount of the distribution taken. The employer
8 account or employer cash balance account shall be restored first out of
9 the current forfeiture amounts and then by additional employer
10 contributions.
