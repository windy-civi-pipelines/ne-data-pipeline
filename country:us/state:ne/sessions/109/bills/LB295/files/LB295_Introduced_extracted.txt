24 service;
25 (b) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
26 (i) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing
27 to the defined contribution benefit prior to ceasing employment; or

27 participation prior to the date the member originally ceased employment
28 and the years of participation after the member is reenrolled in the
29 retirement system shall be included as years of participation, except

31 employment and has taken a distribution, the years of participation prior
-18-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 to the date the member originally ceased employment shall be limited in a
2 ratio equal to the value of the distribution that the member repays
3 divided by the total value of the distribution taken as described in
4 subdivision (6)(c) of this section.
5 (c) A reemployed member may repay all or a portion of the value of a
6 distribution except for an annuity elected after the member ceased
7 employment and before the member was reemployed. Repayment of such a
8 distribution shall commence within three years after reemployment and
9 shall be completed within five years after reemployment or prior to the
10 member again ceasing employment, whichever occurs first, through (i)
11 direct payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment payments made
12 pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization made by
13 the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under the

18 from repaying the value of such a distribution taken between the periods
19 of employment. The value of the member's forfeited employer account or
20 employer cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be
21 restored in a ratio equal to the amount of the distribution repaid by the
22 member divided by the amount of the distribution taken. The employer
23 account or employer cash balance account shall be restored first out of
24 the current forfeiture amounts and then by additional employer
25 contributions.

12 (6) In addition to the cost-of-living adjustments provided in
13 subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, any annuity paid
14 pursuant to the act or pursuant to the provisions of the retirement
15 system established by statute for employees of Class V school districts
16 in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the first payment was
17 dated on or before October 1, 1994, shall be subject to adjustment to

2025 2025
1 levels between the effective date of retirement and June 30, 1998, except
2 that such increase shall not exceed (a) three percent for annuities first

6 (8) Beginning January 1, 2000, and on January 1 of every year
7 thereafter, for employees of Class V school districts who were members
8 prior to July 1, 2013, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be made for any
9 formula annuity being paid pursuant to the act, or pursuant to the
10 provisions of the retirement system established by statute for employees
11 of Class V school districts in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on
12 which the first payment was dated on or before October 3 preceding such
13 January 1 adjustment date. The cost-of-living adjustment for any such
14 annuity shall be the lesser of (a) one and one-half percent or (b) the
15 increase in the consumer price index from the date such annuity first
16 became payable through the August 31 preceding the January 1 adjustment
17 date as reduced by the aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously
18 made to the annuity pursuant to this section.
19 (9) Beginning January 1, 2014, and on January 1 of every year
20 thereafter, for employees of Class V school districts who became members
21 on or after July 1, 2013, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be made for
22 any formula annuity being paid pursuant to the act and on which the first

27 August 31 preceding the January 1 adjustment date as reduced by the
28 aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to the annuity
29 pursuant to this section.
30 (10) Beginning September 1, 1999, the actuary shall make an annual
31 valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system. If the annual
-60-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 valuation made by the actuary, as approved by the board of trustees,
2 indicates that the system has sufficient actuarial surplus to provide for
3 a cost-of-living adjustment in addition to the adjustment made pursuant
4 to subsection (8) or (9) of this section, the board of trustees may, in
5 its discretion, declare by resolution that each annuity being paid
6 pursuant to the act, or pursuant to the provisions of the retirement
7 system established by statute for employees of Class V school districts
8 in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the first payment was
9 dated on or before October 3 of the year such resolution is adopted,
10 shall be increased beginning as of the January 1 following the date of
11 the board of trustees' resolution by such percentage as may be declared
12 by the board of trustees, except that such increase for any such annuity
13 shall not exceed the increase in the consumer price index from the date
14 such annuity first became payable through the applicable valuation date
15 as reduced by the aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to
16 the annuity pursuant to this section.
17 (11) Except for the adjustments pursuant to subsection (13) of this
18 section, the consumer price index to be used for determining any cost-of-
19 living adjustment under this section shall be the Consumer Price Index -
20 All Urban Consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
21 the United States Department of Labor. If this consumer price index is
22 discontinued or replaced, a substitute index published by the United
23 States Department of Labor shall be selected by the board if before
24 September 1, 2024, or by the retirement board if on or after September 1,
25 2024. Any substitute index selected shall be a reasonable representative
26 measurement of the cost of living for retired employees. An annuity as
27 increased by any cost-of-living adjustment made under this section shall
28 be considered the base annuity amount for the purpose of future
29 adjustments pursuant to this section. In no event shall any cost-of-
30 living adjustment be deemed to affect or increase the amount of the base
31 retirement annuity of a member as determined under section 79-999 or
-61-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 79-9,100.
2 (12) Any decision or determination by the board or retirement board,
3 as applicable, (a) to declare or not declare a cost-of-living adjustment,
4 (b) as to whether the annual valuation indicates a sufficient actuarial
5 surplus to provide for a cost-of-living adjustment, or (c) pursuant to
6 the selection of a substitute index shall be made in the sole, absolute,
7 and final discretion of the board or retirement board, as applicable, and
8 shall not be subject to challenge by any member or beneficiary. In no
9 event shall the Legislature be constrained or limited in amending the
10 system or increasing the benefits of members under the system, nor shall
11 the board or retirement board, as applicable, be constrained from
12 supporting any such change to the system, notwithstanding the effect of
13 any such change upon the actuarial surplus of the system and the ability
14 of the board or retirement board, as applicable, to declare future cost-
15 of-living adjustments.
16 (13) The Legislature finds and declares that there exists in this
17 state a pressing need to attract and retain qualified and dedicated
18 public school employees and that one of the factors prospective public
19 school employees consider when seeking or continuing public school
20 employment is the retirement system and benefits the employment provides.
21 The Legislature further finds that over the past decades, as reflected by
22 the Medical Price Index published by the United States Department of
23 Labor, the cost of medical care, including the cost of medications and
24 insurance coverages, has increased at a rate in excess of that by which
25 the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers has increased. The
26 Legislature further finds and declares that there accordingly exists a
27 need to adjust the amount of retirement benefits paid to retired public
28 school employees in order to assist them in meeting the increased cost of
29 medical care. Therefor, in addition to the cost-of-living adjustments
30 provided in subsections (1) through (12) of this section, commencing on
31 October 3, 2001, and on October 3 of every year thereafter, a medical
-62-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid to any annuitant who became a
2 member prior to July 1, 2016, and has been paid an annuity from the
3 retirement system for at least ten years through the October 3 adjustment
4 date. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid in the form of a
5 supplemental annuity providing monthly payments equal to the amount which
6 results when (a) the fraction, not to exceed one, that results when the
7 annuitant's years of creditable service at his or her retirement date is
8 divided by twenty, is multiplied by (b) the product of ten dollars times
9 the number of years, including attained one-half years, that such
10 annuitant has received annuity payments from the retirement system
11 through the October 3 adjustment date. The supplemental annuity being
12 paid to an annuitant shall increase by ten dollars on October 3 of each
13 subsequent year to reflect the additional year of annuity payments to the
14 annuitant until the total amount of the supplemental annuity is two
15 hundred fifty dollars. In no event shall the medical cost-of-living
16 adjustment for any annuitant pursuant to this subsection result in the
17 payment of a supplemental annuity exceeding two hundred fifty dollars per
18 month. The supplemental annuity paid to an annuitant pursuant to this
19 subsection shall cease at the death of the annuitant regardless of the
20 form of retirement annuity being paid to the annuitant at the time of his
21 or her death.
22 Sec. 13. Section 79-9,106, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 79-9,106 (1) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and
25 who has twenty years or more of creditable service, the member's primary
26 beneficiary, as designated by the member in writing on forms provided by
27 the system, shall receive a survivorship annuity in accordance with
28 subdivision (1) of section 79-9,101 if the primary beneficiary is (a) the
29 member's spouse or (b) one other designated beneficiary whose attained
30 age in the calendar year of the member's death is no more than ten years
31 less than the attained age of the member in such calendar year. The
-63-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 amount of such actuarially equivalent annuity shall be calculated using
2 the attained ages of the member and the beneficiary and be based on the
3 annuity earned to the date of the member's death without reduction due to
4 any early commencement of benefits. If Within sixty days from the date of
5 the member's death, if the member has not previously filed with the
6 administrator of the retirement system a form requiring that only the
7 survivorship annuity be paid, the beneficiary may request to receive in a
8 lump sum an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions. If
9 prior to the member's death, the member files with the administrator of
10 the retirement system a form requiring that the beneficiary receive a
11 lump-sum settlement in lieu of the survivorship annuity, the beneficiary
12 shall receive, in lieu of the survivorship annuity, a lump-sum settlement
13 in an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions
14 notwithstanding any other provision of this section.
15 (2) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and who has
16 less than twenty years of creditable service or upon the death of a
17 member who has not yet retired and who has twenty years or more of
18 creditable service but whose beneficiary does not meet the criteria in
19 subsection (1) of this section, a lump sum in an amount equal to the
20 member's accumulated contributions shall be paid pursuant to section
21 79-9,119.
22 (3) A lump-sum death benefit paid pursuant to subsection (1) or (2)
23 of this section, other than the member's estate, that is an eligible
24 distribution may be distributed in the form of a direct transfer to a
25 retirement plan eligible to receive such transfer under the provisions of
26 the Internal Revenue Code.
27 (4) For any member whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2007,
28 while performing qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)
29 of the Internal Revenue Code, the member's beneficiary shall be entitled
30 to any additional death benefit that would have been provided, other than
31 the accrual of any benefit relating to the period of qualified military
-64-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 service. The additional death benefit shall be determined as if the
2 member had returned to employment with the school district and such
3 employment had terminated on the date of the member's death.
4 Sec. 14. Section 79-9,117, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 79-9,117 (1)(a) Until September 1, 2024, the board of trustees shall
7 establish a comprehensive preretirement planning program for school
8 employees who are members of the retirement system. The program shall

10 upon retirement, including, but not limited to, changes in physical and
11 mental health, housing, family life, leisure activity, and retirement
12 income.

14 establish sessions as provided in section 84-1511 for school employees
15 who are members of the retirement system.

19 the federal and state income tax consequences of the various annuity or
20 retirement benefit options available to the member, information on social
21 security benefits, information on various local, state, and federal
22 government programs and programs in the private sector designed to assist
23 elderly persons, and information and advice the board of trustees or
24 retirement board, as applicable, deems valuable in assisting members in
25 the transition from public employment to retirement.
26 (4) The board of trustees or retirement board, as applicable, shall
27 work with any governmental agency, including political subdivisions or
28 bodies whose services or expertise may enhance the development or
29 implementation of the preretirement planning program.
30 (5) The costs of the preretirement planning program shall be charged
31 back to the retirement system.

2025 2025

3 sixteen hours of preretirement planning programs. For purposes of this
4 subsection, leave with pay means a day off paid by an employer and does

19 Sec. 16. Section 81-2014, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

-76-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed that will
2 value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
3 required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
4 actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
5 recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with
6 the board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
7 the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate,
8 plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial
9 accrued liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
10 under this method shall be determined for each individual member on a
11 level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount is then summed
12 for all members;
13 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall
14 be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period, and during each
15 subsequent actuarial valuation through June 30, 2021, changes in the
16 unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits,
17 actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or
18 losses shall be measured and amortized over a thirty-year period
19 beginning on the valuation date of such change;
20 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
21 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
22 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
23 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
24 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period
25 as of the actuarial valuation date; and
26 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
27 of all contributions required pursuant to the Nebraska State Patrol
28 Retirement Act, there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to
29 pay for the differences between the actuarially required contribution
30 rate and the rate of all contributions required pursuant to the act.
31 (b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
-77-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025

2 performed that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the
3 contributions required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board
4 shall perform an actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of
5 actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved by the board,
6 and kept on file with the board using the entry age actuarial cost
7 method. Under such method, the actuarially required funding rate is equal
8 to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize
9 the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of salary
10 basis. The normal cost under such method shall be determined for each
11 individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
12 amount is then summed for all members;
13 (ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
14 changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method,
15 or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a
16 twenty-five-year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
17 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
18 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
19 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
20 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
21 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a twenty-five-year
22 period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
23 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
24 of all contributions required pursuant to the Nebraska State Patrol
25 Retirement Act, it is the intent of the Legislature that there shall be a
26 supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the differences between
27 the actuarially required contribution rate and the rate of all
28 contributions required pursuant to the act.
29 (c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and after
30 the board notifies the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of the
31 Legislature, the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases
-78-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 to reduce future volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such
2 notification to the committee shall be in writing and include, at a
3 minimum, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the plan
4 if the combination or offset were not implemented, the actuary's
5 projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or
6 offset were implemented, and the actuary's explanation of why the
7 combination or offset is in the best interests of the plan at the
8 proposed time.

13 federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be included as gross
14 income of the member until such time as they are distributed or made
15 available. The contributions, although designated as member
16 contributions, shall be paid by the state in lieu of member
17 contributions. The state shall pay these member contributions from the
18 same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the member. The
19 state shall pick up these contributions by a compensation deduction
20 through a reduction in the cash compensation of the member. Member
21 contributions picked up shall be treated for all purposes of the Nebraska
22 State Patrol Retirement Act in the same manner and to the extent as
23 member contributions made prior to the date picked up.
24 Sec. 19. Section 84-1301, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

30 (c) The value of the member's forfeited employer account or employer
31 cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be restored in

10 her benefit shall be considered a new employee as of the date of
11 reemployment and shall not receive credit for any service prior to the

20 service, the member:
21 (a) Shall not be deemed to have had a bona fide separation of
22 service;
23 (b) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
24 (i) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing
25 to the defined contribution benefit prior to ceasing employment; or
26 (ii) The cash balance benefit in which the member was participating
27 prior to ceasing employment if the member was contributing to the cash
28 balance benefit prior to ceasing employment;
29 (c) Shall immediately resume making contributions;

7 retirement system ceases to be an employee and returns to permanent full-
8 time or permanent part-time service in any capacity with the state after
9 having a one-hundred-twenty-day break in service, the member:
10 (i) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
11 (A) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing

18 ceased employment and before the member was reemployed; and

23 and after reentry into the retirement system, the member's years of
24 participation prior to the date the member originally ceased employment
25 and the years of participation after the member is reenrolled in the
26 retirement system shall be included as years of participation, except
27 that if the member is not vested on the date the member originally ceased
28 employment and has taken a distribution, the years of participation prior
29 to the date the member originally ceased employment shall be limited in a
30 ratio equal to the value of the distribution that the member repays
31 divided by the total value of the distribution taken as described in
-93-
LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 subdivision (6)(c) of this section.
2 (c) A reemployed member may repay all or a portion of the value of a
3 distribution except for an annuity elected after the member ceased
4 employment and before the member was reemployed. Repayment of such a
5 distribution shall commence within three years after reemployment and
6 shall be completed within five years after reemployment or prior to the
7 member again ceasing employment, whichever occurs first, through (i)
8 direct payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment payments made
9 pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization made by
10 the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under the
11 Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in
12 accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the
13 member fails to repay all of the value of such a distribution prior to
14 the member again ceasing employment, the member shall be forever barred
15 from repaying the value of such a distribution taken between the periods
16 of employment. The value of the member's forfeited employer account or
17 employer cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be
18 restored in a ratio equal to the amount of the distribution repaid by the
19 member divided by the amount of the distribution taken. The employer
20 account or employer cash balance account shall be restored first out of
21 the current forfeiture amounts and then by additional employer
22 contributions.

1 to determine the potential funding obligation, the board shall, as soon

3 (A) determine whether the entity's contemplated business transaction will

1 (vi) The entity shall pay directly to the board's contracted actuary

29 plan in which the credit was earned. The board may adopt and promulgate
30 rules and regulations governing the assessment and granting of vesting

2025 2025
1 (6) Any employee who qualifies for membership in the retirement
2 system pursuant to this section may not be disqualified from membership
3 in the retirement system solely because such employee also maintains
4 separate employment which qualifies the employee for membership in
5 another public retirement system, nor may membership in this retirement
6 system disqualify such an employee from membership in another public
7 retirement system solely by reason of separate employment which qualifies
8 such employee for membership in this retirement system.
9 (7) A full-time or part-time employee of a city, village, or
10 township who becomes a county employee pursuant to a merger of services

-15-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 in this section, a member of the retirement system who has a five-year
2 break in service shall upon reemployment be considered a new employee
3 with respect to the County Employees Retirement Act and shall not receive
4 credit for service prior to his or her reemployment date.
5 (2)(a) A member who ceases to be an employee before becoming

11 the retirement system under subsection (3) of section 23-2319, years of
12 participation include years of participation prior to such employee's
13 original termination. For a member who is not vested and has received a
14 termination benefit pursuant to section 23-2319, the years of
15 participation prior to such employee's original termination shall be
16 limited in a ratio equal to the amount that the member repays divided by
17 the termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319.
18 (b) The reemployed member may repay the value of, or a portion of
19 the value of, the termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section
20 23-2319. A reemployed member who elects to repay all or a portion of the
21 value of the termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319
22 shall repay the actual earnings on such value. Repayment of the
23 termination benefit shall commence within three years of reemployment and
24 shall be completed within five years of reemployment or prior to
25 termination of employment, whichever occurs first, through (i) direct
26 payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment payments made
27 pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization made by
28 the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under the
29 Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in
30 accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code.
31 (c) The value of the member's forfeited employer account or employer
-16-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be restored in
2 a ratio equal to the amount of the benefit that the member has repaid

7 a permanent full-time employee or permanent part-time employee with a
8 county under the County Employees Retirement Act more than one hundred
9 twenty days after his or her retirement date, the member shall continue
10 receiving retirement benefits. Such a retired member or a retired member
11 who received a lump-sum distribution of his or her benefit shall be
12 considered a new employee as of the date of reemployment and shall not
13 receive credit for any service prior to the member's retirement for
14 purposes of the act.
15 (4) A member who is reinstated as an employee pursuant to a
16 grievance or appeal of his or her termination by the county shall be a
17 member upon reemployment and shall not be considered to have a break in
18 service for such period of time that the grievance or appeal was pending.
19 (5) Beginning January 1, 2020, if a contributing member of the
20 retirement system ceases to be an employee and returns to service in any
21 capacity with any county under the County Employees Retirement Act prior
22 to having a one-hundred-twenty-day break in service, the member:
23 (a) Shall not be deemed to have had a bona fide separation of
24 service;
25 (b) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
26 (i) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing
27 to the defined contribution benefit prior to ceasing employment; or
28 (ii) The cash balance benefit in which the member was participating
29 prior to ceasing employment if the member was contributing to the cash
30 balance benefit prior to ceasing employment;
31 (c) Shall immediately resume making contributions;

2025 2025

9 retirement system ceases to be an employee and returns to permanent full-
10 time or permanent part-time service in any capacity with any county under
11 the County Employees Retirement Act after having a one-hundred-twenty-day
12 break in service, the member:
13 (i) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
14 (A) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing
15 to the defined contribution benefit prior to ceasing employment; or
16 (B) The cash balance benefit in which the member was participating
17 prior to ceasing employment if the member was contributing to the cash
18 balance benefit prior to ceasing employment;

20 (iii) Shall continue receiving any annuity elected after the member
21 ceased employment and before the member was reemployed; and

24 and all counties under the County Employees Retirement Act.
25 (b) For the purposes of vesting employer contributions made prior to
26 and after reentry into the retirement system, the member's years of
27 participation prior to the date the member originally ceased employment
28 and the years of participation after the member is reenrolled in the
29 retirement system shall be included as years of participation, except
30 that if the member is not vested on the date the member originally ceased
31 employment and has taken a distribution, the years of participation prior
-18-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 to the date the member originally ceased employment shall be limited in a
2 ratio equal to the value of the distribution that the member repays
3 divided by the total value of the distribution taken as described in
4 subdivision (6)(c) of this section.
5 (c) A reemployed member may repay all or a portion of the value of a
6 distribution except for an annuity elected after the member ceased
7 employment and before the member was reemployed. Repayment of such a
8 distribution shall commence within three years after reemployment and
9 shall be completed within five years after reemployment or prior to the
10 member again ceasing employment, whichever occurs first, through (i)
11 direct payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment payments made
12 pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization made by
13 the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under the
14 Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in
15 accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the
16 member fails to repay all of the value of such a distribution prior to
17 the member again ceasing employment, the member shall be forever barred
18 from repaying the value of such a distribution taken between the periods
19 of employment. The value of the member's forfeited employer account or
20 employer cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be
21 restored in a ratio equal to the amount of the distribution repaid by the
22 member divided by the amount of the distribution taken. The employer
23 account or employer cash balance account shall be restored first out of
24 the current forfeiture amounts and then by additional employer
25 contributions.

10 member who retired prior to February 21, 1982, pursuant to the Class V
11 School Employees Retirement Act, or to such member's beneficiary, or to a
12 person who retired under the provisions of the retirement system
13 established by statute for employees of Class V school districts in
14 effect prior to September 1, 1951, or to such person's beneficiary, shall

-58-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, any annuity paid on

7 effective date of retirement and June 30, 1995, except that such increase
8 shall not exceed (a) three percent for annuities first paid after October
9 1, 1993, (b) six percent for annuities first paid after October 1, 1992,
10 but on or before October 1, 1993, or (c) nine percent for all other
11 annuities.
12 (6) In addition to the cost-of-living adjustments provided in
13 subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, any annuity paid
14 pursuant to the act or pursuant to the provisions of the retirement
15 system established by statute for employees of Class V school districts
16 in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the first payment was
17 dated on or before October 1, 1994, shall be subject to adjustment to
18 equal the greater of (a) the annuity payable to the member or beneficiary
19 as adjusted, if applicable, under the provisions of subsection (1), (2),
20 (3), (4), or (5) of this section or (b) ninety percent of the annuity
21 which results when the original annuity that was paid to the member or
22 beneficiary (before any cost-of-living adjustments under this section),
23 is adjusted by the increase in the cost of living or wage levels between
24 the commencement date of the annuity and June 30, 1995.
25 (7) In addition to the cost-of-living adjustments provided in
26 subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section, any annuity
27 paid on or after September 1, 1998, pursuant to the act or pursuant to

31 1997, shall be adjusted by the increase in the cost of living or wage
-59-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 levels between the effective date of retirement and June 30, 1998, except
2 that such increase shall not exceed (a) three percent for annuities first
3 paid after October 1, 1996, (b) six percent for annuities first paid
4 after October 1, 1995, but on or before October 1, 1996, or (c) nine

6 (8) Beginning January 1, 2000, and on January 1 of every year
7 thereafter, for employees of Class V school districts who were members
8 prior to July 1, 2013, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be made for any
9 formula annuity being paid pursuant to the act, or pursuant to the
10 provisions of the retirement system established by statute for employees
11 of Class V school districts in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on
12 which the first payment was dated on or before October 3 preceding such
13 January 1 adjustment date. The cost-of-living adjustment for any such
14 annuity shall be the lesser of (a) one and one-half percent or (b) the
15 increase in the consumer price index from the date such annuity first
16 became payable through the August 31 preceding the January 1 adjustment
17 date as reduced by the aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously
18 made to the annuity pursuant to this section.
19 (9) Beginning January 1, 2014, and on January 1 of every year
20 thereafter, for employees of Class V school districts who became members
21 on or after July 1, 2013, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be made for
22 any formula annuity being paid pursuant to the act and on which the first
23 payment was dated on or before October 3 preceding such January 1
24 adjustment date. The cost-of-living adjustment for any such annuity shall
25 be the lesser of (a) one percent or (b) the increase in the consumer
26 price index from the date such annuity first became payable through the
27 August 31 preceding the January 1 adjustment date as reduced by the
28 aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to the annuity
29 pursuant to this section.
30 (10) Beginning September 1, 1999, the actuary shall make an annual
31 valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system. If the annual
-60-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 valuation made by the actuary, as approved by the board of trustees,
2 indicates that the system has sufficient actuarial surplus to provide for
3 a cost-of-living adjustment in addition to the adjustment made pursuant
4 to subsection (8) or (9) of this section, the board of trustees may, in
5 its discretion, declare by resolution that each annuity being paid
6 pursuant to the act, or pursuant to the provisions of the retirement
7 system established by statute for employees of Class V school districts
8 in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the first payment was
9 dated on or before October 3 of the year such resolution is adopted,
10 shall be increased beginning as of the January 1 following the date of
11 the board of trustees' resolution by such percentage as may be declared
12 by the board of trustees, except that such increase for any such annuity
13 shall not exceed the increase in the consumer price index from the date
14 such annuity first became payable through the applicable valuation date
15 as reduced by the aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to
16 the annuity pursuant to this section.
17 (11) Except for the adjustments pursuant to subsection (13) of this
18 section, the consumer price index to be used for determining any cost-of-
19 living adjustment under this section shall be the Consumer Price Index -
20 All Urban Consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
21 the United States Department of Labor. If this consumer price index is
22 discontinued or replaced, a substitute index published by the United
23 States Department of Labor shall be selected by the board if before
24 September 1, 2024, or by the retirement board if on or after September 1,
25 2024. Any substitute index selected shall be a reasonable representative
26 measurement of the cost of living for retired employees. An annuity as
27 increased by any cost-of-living adjustment made under this section shall
28 be considered the base annuity amount for the purpose of future
29 adjustments pursuant to this section. In no event shall any cost-of-
30 living adjustment be deemed to affect or increase the amount of the base
31 retirement annuity of a member as determined under section 79-999 or
-61-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 79-9,100.
2 (12) Any decision or determination by the board or retirement board,
3 as applicable, (a) to declare or not declare a cost-of-living adjustment,
4 (b) as to whether the annual valuation indicates a sufficient actuarial
5 surplus to provide for a cost-of-living adjustment, or (c) pursuant to
6 the selection of a substitute index shall be made in the sole, absolute,
7 and final discretion of the board or retirement board, as applicable, and
8 shall not be subject to challenge by any member or beneficiary. In no
9 event shall the Legislature be constrained or limited in amending the
10 system or increasing the benefits of members under the system, nor shall
11 the board or retirement board, as applicable, be constrained from
12 supporting any such change to the system, notwithstanding the effect of
13 any such change upon the actuarial surplus of the system and the ability
14 of the board or retirement board, as applicable, to declare future cost-
15 of-living adjustments.
16 (13) The Legislature finds and declares that there exists in this
17 state a pressing need to attract and retain qualified and dedicated
18 public school employees and that one of the factors prospective public
19 school employees consider when seeking or continuing public school
20 employment is the retirement system and benefits the employment provides.
21 The Legislature further finds that over the past decades, as reflected by
22 the Medical Price Index published by the United States Department of
23 Labor, the cost of medical care, including the cost of medications and
24 insurance coverages, has increased at a rate in excess of that by which
25 the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers has increased. The
26 Legislature further finds and declares that there accordingly exists a
27 need to adjust the amount of retirement benefits paid to retired public
28 school employees in order to assist them in meeting the increased cost of
29 medical care. Therefor, in addition to the cost-of-living adjustments
30 provided in subsections (1) through (12) of this section, commencing on
31 October 3, 2001, and on October 3 of every year thereafter, a medical
-62-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid to any annuitant who became a
2 member prior to July 1, 2016, and has been paid an annuity from the
3 retirement system for at least ten years through the October 3 adjustment
4 date. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid in the form of a
5 supplemental annuity providing monthly payments equal to the amount which
6 results when (a) the fraction, not to exceed one, that results when the
7 annuitant's years of creditable service at his or her retirement date is
8 divided by twenty, is multiplied by (b) the product of ten dollars times
9 the number of years, including attained one-half years, that such
10 annuitant has received annuity payments from the retirement system
11 through the October 3 adjustment date. The supplemental annuity being
12 paid to an annuitant shall increase by ten dollars on October 3 of each
13 subsequent year to reflect the additional year of annuity payments to the
14 annuitant until the total amount of the supplemental annuity is two
15 hundred fifty dollars. In no event shall the medical cost-of-living
16 adjustment for any annuitant pursuant to this subsection result in the
17 payment of a supplemental annuity exceeding two hundred fifty dollars per
18 month. The supplemental annuity paid to an annuitant pursuant to this
19 subsection shall cease at the death of the annuitant regardless of the
20 form of retirement annuity being paid to the annuitant at the time of his
21 or her death.
22 Sec. 13. Section 79-9,106, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 79-9,106 (1) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and
25 who has twenty years or more of creditable service, the member's primary
26 beneficiary, as designated by the member in writing on forms provided by
27 the system, shall receive a survivorship annuity in accordance with
28 subdivision (1) of section 79-9,101 if the primary beneficiary is (a) the
29 member's spouse or (b) one other designated beneficiary whose attained
30 age in the calendar year of the member's death is no more than ten years
31 less than the attained age of the member in such calendar year. The
-63-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 amount of such actuarially equivalent annuity shall be calculated using
2 the attained ages of the member and the beneficiary and be based on the
3 annuity earned to the date of the member's death without reduction due to
4 any early commencement of benefits. If Within sixty days from the date of
5 the member's death, if the member has not previously filed with the
6 administrator of the retirement system a form requiring that only the
7 survivorship annuity be paid, the beneficiary may request to receive in a
8 lump sum an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions. If
9 prior to the member's death, the member files with the administrator of
10 the retirement system a form requiring that the beneficiary receive a
11 lump-sum settlement in lieu of the survivorship annuity, the beneficiary
12 shall receive, in lieu of the survivorship annuity, a lump-sum settlement
13 in an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions
14 notwithstanding any other provision of this section.
15 (2) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and who has
16 less than twenty years of creditable service or upon the death of a
17 member who has not yet retired and who has twenty years or more of
18 creditable service but whose beneficiary does not meet the criteria in
19 subsection (1) of this section, a lump sum in an amount equal to the
20 member's accumulated contributions shall be paid pursuant to section
21 79-9,119.
22 (3) A lump-sum death benefit paid pursuant to subsection (1) or (2)
23 of this section, other than the member's estate, that is an eligible
24 distribution may be distributed in the form of a direct transfer to a
25 retirement plan eligible to receive such transfer under the provisions of
26 the Internal Revenue Code.
27 (4) For any member whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2007,
28 while performing qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)
29 of the Internal Revenue Code, the member's beneficiary shall be entitled
30 to any additional death benefit that would have been provided, other than
31 the accrual of any benefit relating to the period of qualified military
-64-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 service. The additional death benefit shall be determined as if the
2 member had returned to employment with the school district and such
3 employment had terminated on the date of the member's death.
4 Sec. 14. Section 79-9,117, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 79-9,117 (1)(a) Until September 1, 2024, the board of trustees shall
7 establish a comprehensive preretirement planning program for school
8 employees who are members of the retirement system. The program shall

11 mental health, housing, family life, leisure activity, and retirement
12 income.

14 establish sessions as provided in section 84-1511 for school employees
15 who are members of the retirement system.
16 (2) The preretirement planning program shall be available to all

19 the federal and state income tax consequences of the various annuity or
20 retirement benefit options available to the member, information on social
21 security benefits, information on various local, state, and federal
22 government programs and programs in the private sector designed to assist
23 elderly persons, and information and advice the board of trustees or
24 retirement board, as applicable, deems valuable in assisting members in
25 the transition from public employment to retirement.
26 (4) The board of trustees or retirement board, as applicable, shall
27 work with any governmental agency, including political subdivisions or
28 bodies whose services or expertise may enhance the development or
29 implementation of the preretirement planning program.
30 (5) The costs of the preretirement planning program shall be charged
31 back to the retirement system.
-65-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 (6) An employer shall provide each member leave with pay to attend
2 up to two preretirement planning programs or the equivalent of up to
3 sixteen hours of preretirement planning programs. For purposes of this
4 subsection, leave with pay means a day off paid by an employer and does
5 not mean vacation, sick, personal, or compensatory time. A member may

31 (i) Beginning July 1, 2002, and each fiscal year thereafter, the
-76-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed that will
2 value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
3 required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
4 actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
5 recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with
6 the board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
7 the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate,
8 plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial
9 accrued liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
10 under this method shall be determined for each individual member on a

12 for all members;
13 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall

17 actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or
18 losses shall be measured and amortized over a thirty-year period
19 beginning on the valuation date of such change;
20 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
21 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
22 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
23 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
24 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period
25 as of the actuarial valuation date; and
26 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
27 of all contributions required pursuant to the Nebraska State Patrol
28 Retirement Act, there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to
29 pay for the differences between the actuarially required contribution
30 rate and the rate of all contributions required pursuant to the act.
31 (b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
-77-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025

2 performed that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the
3 contributions required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board
4 shall perform an actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of
5 actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved by the board,
6 and kept on file with the board using the entry age actuarial cost
7 method. Under such method, the actuarially required funding rate is equal
8 to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize
9 the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of salary
10 basis. The normal cost under such method shall be determined for each
11 individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
12 amount is then summed for all members;
13 (ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
14 changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method,
15 or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a
16 twenty-five-year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
17 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
18 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
19 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
20 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
21 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a twenty-five-year
22 period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
23 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
24 of all contributions required pursuant to the Nebraska State Patrol
25 Retirement Act, it is the intent of the Legislature that there shall be a
26 supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the differences between
27 the actuarially required contribution rate and the rate of all
28 contributions required pursuant to the act.
29 (c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and after
30 the board notifies the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of the
31 Legislature, the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases
-78-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
1 to reduce future volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such
2 notification to the committee shall be in writing and include, at a
3 minimum, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the plan
4 if the combination or offset were not implemented, the actuary's
5 projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or
6 offset were implemented, and the actuary's explanation of why the
7 combination or offset is in the best interests of the plan at the
8 proposed time.
9 (4) The state shall pick up the member contributions required by
10 this section for all compensation paid on or after January 1, 1985, and

13 federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be included as gross
14 income of the member until such time as they are distributed or made
15 available. The contributions, although designated as member
16 contributions, shall be paid by the state in lieu of member
17 contributions. The state shall pay these member contributions from the
18 same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the member. The
19 state shall pick up these contributions by a compensation deduction
20 through a reduction in the cash compensation of the member. Member
21 contributions picked up shall be treated for all purposes of the Nebraska
22 State Patrol Retirement Act in the same manner and to the extent as
23 member contributions made prior to the date picked up.
24 Sec. 19. Section 84-1301, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

28 employment and has taken a distribution, the years of participation prior
29 to the date the member originally ceased employment shall be limited in a
