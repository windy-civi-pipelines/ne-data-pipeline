retirement under section 23-2315 and again becomes a permanent full-time or

service shall immediately be reenrolled in the retirement system and resume
making contributions. For purposes of vesting employer contributions made prior
to and after the reentry into the retirement system under subsection (3) of
section 23-2319, years of participation include years of participation prior to
such employee's original termination. For a member who is not vested and has
received a termination benefit pursuant to section 23-2319, the years of
participation prior to such employee's original termination shall be limited in
a ratio equal to the amount that the member repays divided by the termination
benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319.
(b) The reemployed member may repay the value of, or a portion of the
value of, the termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319. A
reemployed member who elects to repay all or a portion of the value of the
termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319 shall repay the
actual earnings on such value. Repayment of the termination benefit shall
commence within three years of reemployment and shall be completed within five
years of reemployment or prior to termination of employment, whichever occurs
first, through (i) direct payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment
payments made pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization
made by the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under
the Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in
accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(c) The value of the member's forfeited employer account or employer cash
balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be restored in a ratio
equal to the amount of the benefit that the member has repaid divided by the
termination benefit received. The employer account or employer cash balance
account shall be restored first out of the current forfeiture amounts and then
-6-

by additional employer contributions.
(3) For a member who retired pursuant to section 23-2315 and becomes a
permanent full-time employee or permanent part-time employee with a county
under the County Employees Retirement Act more than one hundred twenty days
after his or her retirement date, the member shall continue receiving
retirement benefits. Such a retired member or a retired member who received a
lump-sum distribution of his or her benefit shall be considered a new employee
as of the date of reemployment and shall not receive credit for any service
prior to the member's retirement for purposes of the act.
(4) A member who is reinstated as an employee pursuant to a grievance or
appeal of his or her termination by the county shall be a member upon
reemployment and shall not be considered to have a break in service for such

twenty-day break in service, the member:
(a) Shall not be deemed to have had a bona fide separation of service;
(b) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
(i) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing to the
defined contribution benefit prior to ceasing employment; or
(ii) The cash balance benefit in which the member was participating prior
to ceasing employment if the member was contributing to the cash balance
benefit prior to ceasing employment;
(c) Shall immediately resume making contributions;
(d) Shall make up any missed contributions based upon services rendered
and compensation received;
(e) Shall have all distributions from the retirement system canceled; and
(f) Shall repay the gross distributions from the retirement system unless
the board determines that all or any portion of such gross distributions were
the result of an inadvertent benefit overpayment and repayment of such gross
distributions would create a significant hardship.
(6)(a) Beginning January 1, 2020, if a contributing member of the
retirement system ceases to be an employee and returns to permanent full-time
or permanent part-time service in any capacity with any county under the County
Employees Retirement Act after having a one-hundred-twenty-day break in
service, the member:
(i) Shall be immediately reenrolled in:
(A) The defined contribution benefit if the member was contributing to the

employment and before the member was reemployed; and
(iv) Shall be prohibited from taking any distributions from the retirement
system until the employee again terminates employment with any and all counties
under the County Employees Retirement Act.
(b) For the purposes of vesting employer contributions made prior to and
after reentry into the retirement system, the member's years of participation
prior to the date the member originally ceased employment and the years of
participation after the member is reenrolled in the retirement system shall be
included as years of participation, except that if the member is not vested on
the date the member originally ceased employment and has taken a distribution,
the years of participation prior to the date the member originally ceased
employment shall be limited in a ratio equal to the value of the distribution
that the member repays divided by the total value of the distribution taken as
described in subdivision (6)(c) of this section.
(c) A reemployed member may repay all or a portion of the value of a
distribution except for an annuity elected after the member ceased employment
and before the member was reemployed. Repayment of such a distribution shall
commence within three years after reemployment and shall be completed within
five years after reemployment or prior to the member again ceasing employment,
whichever occurs first, through (i) direct payments to the retirement system,
(ii) installment payments made pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll
deduction authorization made by the member, (iii) an eligible rollover
distribution as provided under the Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct
rollover distribution made in accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the
Internal Revenue Code. If the member fails to repay all of the value of such a
distribution prior to the member again ceasing employment, the member shall be
forever barred from repaying the value of such a distribution taken between the
periods of employment. The value of the member's forfeited employer account or
employer cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be restored
in a ratio equal to the amount of the distribution repaid by the member divided
by the amount of the distribution taken. The employer account or employer cash
balance account shall be restored first out of the current forfeiture amounts
and then by additional employer contributions.

(5)(a) Prior to July 1, 2021:
(i) Beginning July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, the board
shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed that will value the
plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions required for such
fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an actuarial valuation of
the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary,
approved by the board, and kept on file with the board using the entry age
actuarial cost method. Under this method, the actuarially required funding rate
is equal to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to
amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of
salary basis. The normal cost under this method shall be determined for each
individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount
is then summed for all members;
(ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall be
reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period, and during each
subsequent actuarial valuation through June 30, 2021, changes in the unfunded
actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions,
the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and
amortized over a thirty-year period beginning on the valuation date of such
change;
(iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry age
actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial valuation date,
then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities shall be considered fully
funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability shall be reinitialized and
amortized over a thirty-year period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
(iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate of all
contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act, there shall be a
supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the differences between the
actuarially required contribution rate and the rate of all contributions
required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act.
(b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
(i) The board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be performed
that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with the
-11-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under such method, the
actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate, plus the
contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued
liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost under such
method shall be determined for each individual member on a level percentage of
salary basis. The normal cost amount is then summed for all members;
(ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or
actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a twenty-five-
year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
(iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry age
actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial valuation date,
then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities shall be considered fully
funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability shall be reinitialized and
amortized over a twenty-five-year period as of the actuarial valuation date;
and
(iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate of all
contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act, there shall be a
supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the differences between the
actuarially required contribution rate and the rate of all contributions
required pursuant to the act.
(c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and after the
board notifies the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of the Legislature,
the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases to reduce future
volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such notification to the
committee shall be in writing and include, at a minimum, the actuary's
projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or offset
were not implemented, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the
plan if the combination or offset were implemented, and the actuary's
explanation of why the combination or offset is in the best interests of the
plan at the proposed time.
(d) For purposes of this subsection, the rate of all contributions
required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act includes (i) member
contributions, (ii) state contributions pursuant to subsection (6) of this
section which shall be considered as a contribution for the plan year ending
the prior June 30, (iii) court fees as provided in subsection (3) of this
section, and (iv) all fees pursuant to sections 25-2804, 33-103, 33-103.01,
33-106.02, 33-123, 33-124, 33-125, 33-126.02, 33-126.03, and 33-126.06, as
directed to be remitted to the fund.
(6)(a) In addition to the contributions otherwise required by this
section, beginning July 1, 2023, and on July 1 of each year thereafter, the
state shall contribute or as soon thereafter as administratively possible, the
State Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund to the Nebraska Retirement
Fund for Judges an amount equal to five percent of the total annual
compensation of all members of the retirement system except as otherwise
provided in this subsection and as such rate shall be adjusted or terminated by
the Legislature. No adjustment may cause the total contribution rate
established in this subsection to exceed five percent. For purposes of this
subsection, (i) total annual compensation is based on the total member
compensation reported in the most recent annual actuarial valuation report for
the retirement system produced for the board pursuant to section 84-1503 and
(ii) the contribution described in this subsection shall be considered as a
contribution for the plan year ending the prior June 30.
(b) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is at or above
one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the annual
actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the percentage of
the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on projected annual
actuarial valuation report results including the funded ratio, actuarial
contribution, and expected revenue sources using several assumed investment
return scenarios that the actuary deems to be reasonable, and shall make a
recommendation to the board as part of the annual actuarial valuation report.
(c) If the state contribution rate has been adjusted to less than five
percent and the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is below one
hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the annual actuarial

1, 1951, and on which the first payment was dated on or before October 1, 1994,
shall be subject to adjustment to equal the greater of (a) the annuity payable
to the member or beneficiary as adjusted, if applicable, under the provisions
of subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section or (b) ninety percent
of the annuity which results when the original annuity that was paid to the
member or beneficiary (before any cost-of-living adjustments under this
section), is adjusted by the increase in the cost of living or wage levels
between the commencement date of the annuity and June 30, 1995.
(7) In addition to the cost-of-living adjustments provided in subsections
(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section, any annuity paid on or after
September 1, 1998, pursuant to the act or pursuant to the provisions of the
retirement system established by statute for employees of Class V school
districts in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the first payment
was dated on or before October 3, 1997, shall be adjusted by the increase in
the cost of living or wage levels between the effective date of retirement and
June 30, 1998, except that such increase shall not exceed (a) three percent for
annuities first paid after October 1, 1996, (b) six percent for annuities first
paid after October 1, 1995, but on or before October 1, 1996, or (c) nine
percent for all other annuities.
(8) Beginning January 1, 2000, and on January 1 of every year thereafter,
for employees of Class V school districts who were members prior to July 1,
2013, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be made for any formula annuity being
paid pursuant to the act, or pursuant to the provisions of the retirement
system established by statute for employees of Class V school districts in
effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the first payment was dated on
or before October 3 preceding such January 1 adjustment date. The cost-of-
living adjustment for any such annuity shall be the lesser of (a) one and one-
half percent or (b) the increase in the consumer price index from the date such
annuity first became payable through the August 31 preceding the January 1
adjustment date as reduced by the aggregate cost-of-living adjustments
previously made to the annuity pursuant to this section.
(9) Beginning January 1, 2014, and on January 1 of every year thereafter,
for employees of Class V school districts who became members on or after July
1, 2013, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be made for any formula annuity
being paid pursuant to the act and on which the first payment was dated on or
before October 3 preceding such January 1 adjustment date. The cost-of-living
adjustment for any such annuity shall be the lesser of (a) one percent or (b)
the increase in the consumer price index from the date such annuity first
-24-

LB295 LB295
2025 2025
became payable through the August 31 preceding the January 1 adjustment date as
reduced by the aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to the
annuity pursuant to this section.
(10) Beginning September 1, 1999, the actuary shall make an annual
valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system. If the annual valuation
made by the actuary, as approved by the board of trustees, indicates that the
system has sufficient actuarial surplus to provide for a cost-of-living
adjustment in addition to the adjustment made pursuant to subsection (8) or (9)
of this section, the board of trustees may, in its discretion, declare by
resolution that each annuity being paid pursuant to the act, or pursuant to the
provisions of the retirement system established by statute for employees of
Class V school districts in effect prior to September 1, 1951, and on which the
first payment was dated on or before October 3 of the year such resolution is
adopted, shall be increased beginning as of the January 1 following the date of
the board of trustees' resolution by such percentage as may be declared by the
board of trustees, except that such increase for any such annuity shall not
exceed the increase in the consumer price index from the date such annuity
first became payable through the applicable valuation date as reduced by the
aggregate cost-of-living adjustments previously made to the annuity pursuant to
this section.
(11) Except for the adjustments pursuant to subsection (13) of this
section, the consumer price index to be used for determining any cost-of-living
adjustment under this section shall be the Consumer Price Index - All Urban
Consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States
Department of Labor. If this consumer price index is discontinued or replaced,
a substitute index published by the United States Department of Labor shall be
selected by the board if before September 1, 2024, or by the retirement board
if on or after September 1, 2024. Any substitute index selected shall be a
reasonable representative measurement of the cost of living for retired
employees. An annuity as increased by any cost-of-living adjustment made under
this section shall be considered the base annuity amount for the purpose of
future adjustments pursuant to this section. In no event shall any cost-of-
living adjustment be deemed to affect or increase the amount of the base
retirement annuity of a member as determined under section 79-999 or 79-9,100.
(12) Any decision or determination by the board or retirement board, as
applicable, (a) to declare or not declare a cost-of-living adjustment, (b) as
to whether the annual valuation indicates a sufficient actuarial surplus to
provide for a cost-of-living adjustment, or (c) pursuant to the selection of a
substitute index shall be made in the sole, absolute, and final discretion of
the board or retirement board, as applicable, and shall not be subject to
challenge by any member or beneficiary. In no event shall the Legislature be
constrained or limited in amending the system or increasing the benefits of
members under the system, nor shall the board or retirement board, as
applicable, be constrained from supporting any such change to the system,
notwithstanding the effect of any such change upon the actuarial surplus of the
system and the ability of the board or retirement board, as applicable, to
declare future cost-of-living adjustments.
(13) The Legislature finds and declares that there exists in this state a
pressing need to attract and retain qualified and dedicated public school
employees and that one of the factors prospective public school employees
consider when seeking or continuing public school employment is the retirement
system and benefits the employment provides. The Legislature further finds that
over the past decades, as reflected by the Medical Price Index published by the
United States Department of Labor, the cost of medical care, including the cost
of medications and insurance coverages, has increased at a rate in excess of
that by which the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers has increased. The
Legislature further finds and declares that there accordingly exists a need to
adjust the amount of retirement benefits paid to retired public school
employees in order to assist them in meeting the increased cost of medical
care. Therefor, in addition to the cost-of-living adjustments provided in
subsections (1) through (12) of this section, commencing on October 3, 2001,
and on October 3 of every year thereafter, a medical cost-of-living adjustment
shall be paid to any annuitant who became a member prior to July 1, 2016, and
has been paid an annuity from the retirement system for at least ten years
through the October 3 adjustment date. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be
paid in the form of a supplemental annuity providing monthly payments equal to
the amount which results when (a) the fraction, not to exceed one, that results
when the annuitant's years of creditable service at his or her retirement date
is divided by twenty, is multiplied by (b) the product of ten dollars times the
number of years, including attained one-half years, that such annuitant has
received annuity payments from the retirement system through the October 3
adjustment date. The supplemental annuity being paid to an annuitant shall
increase by ten dollars on October 3 of each subsequent year to reflect the
additional year of annuity payments to the annuitant until the total amount of
the supplemental annuity is two hundred fifty dollars. In no event shall the
medical cost-of-living adjustment for any annuitant pursuant to this subsection
result in the payment of a supplemental annuity exceeding two hundred fifty
dollars per month. The supplemental annuity paid to an annuitant pursuant to
this subsection shall cease at the death of the annuitant regardless of the
form of retirement annuity being paid to the annuitant at the time of his or
her death.
Sec. 15. Section 79-9,106, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

79-9,106 (1) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and who
has twenty years or more of creditable service, the member's primary
beneficiary, as designated by the member in writing on forms provided by the
system, shall receive a survivorship annuity in accordance with subdivision (1)
of section 79-9,101 if the primary beneficiary is (a) the member's spouse or
(b) one other designated beneficiary whose attained age in the calendar year of
the member's death is no more than ten years less than the attained age of the
member in such calendar year. The amount of such actuarially equivalent annuity
shall be calculated using the attained ages of the member and the beneficiary
and be based on the annuity earned to the date of the member's death without
reduction due to any early commencement of benefits. Within ninety sixty days
from the date of the member's death, if the member has not previously filed
with the administrator of the retirement system a form requiring that only the
survivorship annuity be paid, the beneficiary may request to receive in a lump
sum an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions. If prior to the
member's death, the member files with the administrator of the retirement
system a form requiring that the beneficiary receive a lump-sum settlement in
lieu of the survivorship annuity, the beneficiary shall receive, in lieu of the
survivorship annuity, a lump-sum settlement in an amount equal to the member's
accumulated contributions notwithstanding any other provision of this section.
(2) Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired and who has less
than twenty years of creditable service or upon the death of a member who has
not yet retired and who has twenty years or more of creditable service but
whose beneficiary does not meet the criteria in subsection (1) of this section,
a lump sum in an amount equal to the member's accumulated contributions shall
be paid pursuant to section 79-9,119.
(3) A lump-sum death benefit paid pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of
this section, other than the member's estate, that is an eligible distribution
may be distributed in the form of a direct transfer to a retirement plan
eligible to receive such transfer under the provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code.
(4) For any member whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2007, while
performing qualified military service as defined in section 414(u) of the
Internal Revenue Code, the member's beneficiary shall be entitled to any
additional death benefit that would have been provided, other than the accrual
of any benefit relating to the period of qualified military service. The
additional death benefit shall be determined as if the member had returned to
employment with the school district and such employment had terminated on the
date of the member's death.
Sec. 16. Section 79-9,117, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:

with any governmental agency, including political subdivisions or bodies whose
services or expertise may enhance the development or implementation of the
preretirement planning program.
(5) The costs of the preretirement planning program shall be charged back
to the retirement system.
(6) An employer shall provide each member leave with pay to attend up to
two preretirement planning programs or the equivalent of up to sixteen hours of
preretirement planning programs. For purposes of this subsection, leave with
pay means a day off paid by an employer and does not mean vacation, sick,
personal, or compensatory time. A member may choose to attend a program more
than twice, but such leave shall be at the expense of the member and shall be
at the discretion of the employer. A member shall not be entitled to attend
more than one preretirement planning program per fiscal year prior to actual
election of retirement.
(7) A nominal registration fee may be charged to each person attending a
preretirement planning program to cover the costs for meals, meeting rooms, or
other expenses incurred under such program.

periods of employment. The value of the member's forfeited employer account or
employer cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be restored
