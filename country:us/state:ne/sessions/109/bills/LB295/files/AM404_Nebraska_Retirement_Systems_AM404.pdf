30 value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the contributions
31 required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board shall perform an
-4-

AM404 AM404
LB295 LB295
MJP - 02/25/2025 MJP - 02/25/2025
1 actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of actuarial assumptions
2 recommended by the actuary, approved by the board, and kept on file with
3 the board using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
4 the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate,
5 plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial
6 accrued liability on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
7 under this method shall be determined for each individual member on a
8 level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount is then summed
9 for all members;
10 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing unfunded liabilities shall
11 be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period, and during each
12 subsequent actuarial valuation through June 30, 2021, changes in the
13 unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits,
14 actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or
15 losses shall be measured and amortized over a thirty-year period
16 beginning on the valuation date of such change;
17 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
18 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
19 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
20 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
21 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year period
22 as of the actuarial valuation date; and
23 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
24 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
25 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
26 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
27 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act.
28 (b) Beginning July 1, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter:
29 (i) The board shall cause an annual actuarial valuation to be
30 performed that will value the plan assets for the year and ascertain the
31 contributions required for such fiscal year. The actuary for the board
-5-

AM404 AM404
LB295 LB295
MJP - 02/25/2025 MJP - 02/25/2025
1 shall perform an actuarial valuation of the system on the basis of
2 actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved by the board,
3 and kept on file with the board using the entry age actuarial cost
4 method. Under such method, the actuarially required funding rate is equal
5 to the normal cost rate, plus the contribution rate necessary to amortize
6 the unfunded actuarial accrued liability on a level percentage of salary
7 basis. The normal cost under such method shall be determined for each
8 individual member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost
9 amount is then summed for all members;
10 (ii) Any changes in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability due to
11 changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, the asset valuation method,
12 or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured and amortized over a
13 twenty-five-year period beginning on the valuation date of such change;
14 (iii) If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry
15 age actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial
16 valuation date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities
17 shall be considered fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued
18 liability shall be reinitialized and amortized over a twenty-five-year
19 period as of the actuarial valuation date; and
20 (iv) If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate
21 of all contributions required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act,
22 there shall be a supplemental appropriation sufficient to pay for the
23 differences between the actuarially required contribution rate and the
24 rate of all contributions required pursuant to the act.
25 (c) Upon the recommendation of the actuary to the board, and after
26 the board notifies the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of the
27 Legislature, the board may combine or offset certain amortization bases
28 to reduce future volatility of the actuarial contribution rate. Such
29 notification to the committee shall be in writing and include, at a
30 minimum, the actuary's projection of the contributions to fund the plan
31 if the combination or offset were not implemented, the actuary's
-6-

MJP - 02/25/2025 MJP - 02/25/2025
1 projection of the contributions to fund the plan if the combination or
2 offset were implemented, and the actuary's explanation of why the
3 combination or offset is in the best interests of the plan at the
4 proposed time.
5 (d) For purposes of this subsection, the rate of all contributions
6 required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act includes (i) member
7 contributions, (ii) state contributions pursuant to subsection (6) of
8 this section which shall be considered as a contribution for the plan
9 year ending the prior June 30, (iii) court fees as provided in subsection
10 (3) of this section, and (iv) all fees pursuant to sections 25-2804,
11 33-103, 33-103.01, 33-106.02, 33-123, 33-124, 33-125, 33-126.02,
12 33-126.03, and 33-126.06, as directed to be remitted to the fund.
13 (6)(a) In addition to the contributions otherwise required by this
14 section, beginning July 1, 2023, and on July 1 of each year thereafter,
15 the state shall contribute or as soon thereafter as administratively
16 possible, the State Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund to the
17 Nebraska Retirement Fund for Judges an amount equal to five percent of
18 the total annual compensation of all members of the retirement system
19 except as otherwise provided in this subsection and as such rate shall be
20 adjusted or terminated by the Legislature. No adjustment may cause the
21 total contribution rate established in this subsection to exceed five
22 percent. For purposes of this subsection, (i) total annual compensation
23 is based on the total member compensation reported in the most recent
24 annual actuarial valuation report for the retirement system produced for
25 the board pursuant to section 84-1503 and (ii) the contribution described
26 in this subsection shall be considered as a contribution for the plan
27 year ending the prior June 30.
28 (b) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is at or
29 above one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
30 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
31 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
-7-

LB295 LB295
MJP - 02/25/2025 MJP - 02/25/2025
1 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
2 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
3 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
4 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
5 annual actuarial valuation report.
6 (c) If the state contribution rate has been adjusted to less than
7 five percent and the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets is
8 below one hundred percent for two consecutive years as reported in the
9 annual actuarial valuation report, the actuary shall assess whether the
10 percentage of the state contribution rate should be adjusted based on
11 projected annual actuarial valuation report results including the funded
12 ratio, actuarial contribution, and expected revenue sources using several
13 assumed investment return scenarios that the actuary deems to be
14 reasonable, and shall make a recommendation to the board as part of the
15 annual actuarial valuation report.
16 (d) If an annual actuarial valuation report includes a
17 recommendation from the actuary to adjust the contribution rate as
18 described in subdivision (b) or (c) of this subsection, the board shall
19 provide written notice electronically to the Nebraska Retirement Systems
20 Committee of the Legislature, to the Governor, and to the Supreme Court
21 of such recommendation within seven business days after voting to approve
22 an annual actuarial valuation report. The notice shall include the
23 actuary's recommendation and analysis regarding such adjustment.
24 (e) Following receipt of the actuary's recommendation and analysis
25 pursuant to this subsection, the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee of
26 the Legislature shall determine the amount of any adjustment of the
27 contribution rate and, if necessary, shall propose any such adjustment to
28 the Legislature.
29 (7) The state or county shall pick up the member contributions
30 required by this section for all compensation paid on or after January 1,
31 1985, and the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer

5 member contributions, shall be paid by the state or county in lieu of
6 member contributions. The state or county shall pay these member
7 contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying
8 earnings to the member. The state or county shall pick up these
9 contributions by a compensation deduction through a reduction in the
10 compensation of the member. Member contributions picked up shall be
11 treated for all purposes of the Judges Retirement Act in the same manner
12 and to the extent as member contributions made prior to the date picked
13 up.
