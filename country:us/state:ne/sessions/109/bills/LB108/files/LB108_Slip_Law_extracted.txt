firefighters covered by an absolute coverage group.
(2) Each such city shall contribute any additional amounts necessary to
fund retirement or other retirement plan benefits not provided by employee
contributions or city contributions to the employer account required by
subsection (1) of this section. Such additional contributions shall be
accumulated in an unallocated employer account of the Firefighters Retirement
System Fund and used to provide the benefits, if any, specified in sections
