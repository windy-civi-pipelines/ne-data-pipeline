-11-

LB287 LB287
2025 2025
1 election by the resident owners of such district or a candidate for
2 election by all of the owners of real estate located in the district. If
3 a person filing for the office of trustee is a designated representative
4 of a limited partnership, a general partnership, a limited liability
5 company, a public, private, or municipal corporation, an estate, or a
6 trust which owns real estate in the district, the name of such entity
7 shall accompany the name of the candidate on the ballot in the following

9 the board. The name of each candidate shall appear on only one ballot.
10 The name of a person may be written in and voted for as a candidate
11 for the office of trustee, and such write-in candidate may be elected to

22 shall not be counted.
23 A trustee shall be an owner of real estate located in the district
24 or shall be a person designated to serve as a representative on the board
25 of trustees if the real estate is owned by a limited partnership, a

28 election shall be mailed by the clerk of the district not later than

1 deeds as of a date designated by the election commissioner or county
2 clerk, which date shall be not more than eighty days prior to the
3 election.
4 (2)(a) For any sanitary and improvement district, a person whose
5 ownership or right to vote becomes of record or is received after the
6 date specified pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may vote when
7 such person establishes the right to vote to the satisfaction of the
8 election board. At the first election and at the election held two years
9 after the first election, any person may cast one vote for each trustee
10 for each acre of unplatted land or fraction thereof and one vote for each
11 platted lot which such person may own in the district.
12 (b) This subdivision applies to a district until the board of
13 trustees amends its articles of association pursuant to subdivision (2)
14 (d) of this section. At the elections election held four years and six
15 years after the first election of trustees, two members of the board of
16 trustees shall be elected by the legal property owners resident within
17 such sanitary and improvement district and three members shall be elected
18 by all of the owners of real estate located in the district pursuant to
19 this section. Every resident property owner may cast one vote for a

22 one vote for each acre of unplatted land or fraction thereof and for each
23 platted lot owned within the district for a candidate for each office of

31 thereafter, three members of the board of trustees shall be elected by
-13-

LB287 LB287
2025 2025
1 the legal property owners resident within such sanitary and improvement
2 district and two members shall be elected by all of the owners of real
3 estate located in the district pursuant to this section. If there are not
4 any legal property owners resident within such district or if not less
5 than ninety percent of the area of the district is owned for other than
6 residential uses, the five members shall be elected by the legal property
7 owners of all property within such district as provided in this section.
8 (c) Any public, private, or municipal corporation owning any land or
9 lot in the district may vote at an election the same as an individual. If
10 more than fifty percent of the homes in any sanitary and improvement
11 district are used as a second, seasonal, or recreational residence, the
12 owners of such property shall be considered legal property owners
13 resident within such district for purposes of electing trustees. For
14 purposes of voting for trustees, each condominium apartment under a
15 condominium property regime established prior to January 1, 1984, under
16 the Condominium Property Act or established after January 1, 1984, under
17 the Nebraska Condominium Act shall be deemed to be a platted lot and the
18 lessee or the owner of the lessee's interest, under any lease for an
19 initial term of not less than twenty years which requires the lessee to
20 pay taxes and special assessments levied on the leased property, shall be
21 deemed to be the owner of the property so leased and entitled to cast the
22 vote of such property. When ownership of a platted lot or unplatted land
23 is held jointly by two or more persons, whether as joint tenants, tenants
24 in common, limited partners, members of a limited liability company, or
25 any other form of joint ownership, only one person shall be entitled to
26 cast the vote of such property. The executor, administrator, guardian, or
27 trustee of any person or estate interested shall have the right to vote.
28 No corporation, estate, or irrevocable trust shall be deemed to be a
29 resident owner for purposes of voting for trustees. Should two or more
30 persons or officials claim the right to vote on the same tract, the
31 election board shall determine the party entitled to vote. Such board
-14-

LB287 LB287
2025 2025
1 shall select one of their number chairperson and one of their number
2 clerk. In case of a vacancy on such board, the remaining trustees shall
3 fill the vacancy on such board until the next election.
4 (d) For any sanitary and improvement district which has been in
5 existence for at least ten years, which has less than seventy property
6 owners entitled to vote for trustees, which has at least two resident
7 property owners, and in which less than ten percent of the area of the
8 district is owned for other than residential uses, the board of trustees
9 may amend its articles of association as provided in section 31-740.01 to
10 provide for a reduction in the number of trustees on the board from five
11 members to three members to be effective at the beginning of the term of
12 office for the board of trustees elected at the next election. At the
13 next election and at each election thereafter, two members of the board
14 of trustees shall be elected by the legal property owners resident within
15 such sanitary and improvement district and one member shall be elected by
