amnesty shall pay all unreported taxes that were due on or before April 1,
2004. Any person that applies for tax amnesty and is accepted by the Tax
Commissioner shall have any penalties and interest waived on unreported and
delinquent taxes notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary.
(2) To be eligible for the tax amnesty provided by this section, the
person shall apply for amnesty within the amnesty period, file a return for
each taxable period for which the amnesty is requested by December 31, 2004, if
no return has been filed, and pay in full all taxes for which amnesty is sought
with the return or within thirty days after the application if a return was
filed prior to the amnesty period. Tax amnesty shall not be available for any
person that is under civil or criminal audit, investigation, or prosecution for
unreported or delinquent taxes by this state or the United States Government on
or before April 16, 2004.
(3) The department shall not seek civil or criminal prosecution against
any person for any taxable period for which amnesty has been granted. The Tax
Commissioner shall develop forms for applying for the tax amnesty program,
develop procedures for qualification for tax amnesty, and conduct a public
awareness campaign publicizing the program.
(4) If a person elects to participate in the amnesty program, the election
shall constitute an express and irrevocable relinquishment of all
administrative and judicial rights to challenge the imposition of the tax or
its amount. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the department from
adjusting a return as a result of any state or federal audit.
(5)(a) Except for any local option sales tax collected and returned to the
appropriate municipality and any motor vehicle fuel, diesel fuel, and
compressed fuel taxes, which shall be deposited in the Highway Trust Fund or
Highway Allocation Fund as provided by law, no less than eighty percent of all
revenue received pursuant to the tax amnesty program shall be deposited in the
General Fund and ten percent, not to exceed five hundred thousand dollars,
shall be deposited in the Department of Revenue Enforcement Fund. Any amount
that would otherwise be deposited in the Department of Revenue Enforcement Fund
that is in excess of the five-hundred-thousand-dollar limitation shall be
deposited in the General Fund.
(b) For fiscal year 2005-06, all proceeds in the Department of Revenue
Enforcement Fund shall be appropriated to the department for purposes of
employing investigators, agents, and auditors and otherwise increasing
personnel for enforcement of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967.
(c) For fiscal years after fiscal year 2005-06, twenty percent of all
