examine potential changes to Nebraska's teacher certification requirements to
create an apprenticeship-based pathway for individuals with equivalent
education and professional experience who seek to transition into kindergarten
through grade twelve teaching.
Nebraska faces ongoing challenges in attracting and retaining qualified
educators, particularly in rural and high-need school districts, and the
traditional teacher certification process may present barriers for individuals
with equivalent education and professional experience in other fields who seek
to transition into the teaching profession later in their careers. Alternative
pathways to certification, including onsite apprenticeship programs conducted
by school districts, may provide opportunities to increase the number of
qualified teachers while maintaining high-quality standards for Nebraska
schools. Such apprenticeship programs would focus on pedagogical training,
classroom management, and other essential instructional skills to ensure
competency and effectiveness in teaching. The State Board of Education plays a
critical role in establishing standards and oversight mechanisms for teacher
certification programs, including alternative pathways such as school district
led apprenticeships.
This interim study is meant to examine potential changes to Nebraska's
teacher certification requirements to allow individuals with equivalent
education and experience to enter the teaching profession through an
apprenticeship-based pathway conducted by school districts. Such study shall
include, but need not be limited to:
(1) An evaluation of existing barriers within Nebraska’s current teacher

certification process that may hinder professionals from transitioning into
teaching;
(2) An examination of best practices from other states that have
implemented alternative certification pathways, including apprenticeship
programs;
(3) An assessment of the pedagogical and classroom management training
necessary to maintain high-quality instructional standards in an apprenticeship
program;
(4) A determination of the role of school districts in designing and
implementing apprenticeship programs for prospective teachers;
(5) An examination of the process by which the State Board of Education
would approve school district apprenticeship programs and ensure alignment of
such programs with state educational standards;
(6) An investigation of the criteria and process by which individuals
completing an apprenticeship program would be certified as teachers in
Nebraska;
(7) Consideration of the potential impact of an apprenticeship pathway on
addressing teacher shortages in critical subject areas and geographic regions;
(8) An identification of any statutory or regulatory changes necessary to
implement such an apprenticeship pathway; and
(9) Input from relevant stakeholders, including representatives from the
State Department of Education, the State Board of Education, school district
administrators, teacher preparation programs, educators, and other interested
parties.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Education Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
