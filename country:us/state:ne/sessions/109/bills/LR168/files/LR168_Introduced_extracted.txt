ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 168
Lonowski, 33; McKeon, 41; Meyer, 17; Murman, 38; Quick, 35;
Sorrentino, 39; Storm, 23.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study of the
purposes, uses, and utility of the Noxious Weed and Invasive Plant Species
Assistance Fund and associated grants awarded pursuant to the Noxious Weed
Control Act. The study shall include a review of the history and
accomplishments of riparian vegetation management projects funded in whole or
in part through grants awarded under the act. This history shall include:
(1) A listing of recipients of grant awards;
(2) An overview of management objectives of projects awarded grants under
the program;
(3) An overview of cooperating and participating state, federal, and local
governmental entities or private entities providing cost-share funds, in-kind
contributions, or other contributions;
(4) An overview of landowner participation; and
(5) A review of the role of the Riparian Vegetation Management Task Force.
The study shall identify and prioritize riparian vegetation management
projects. Such identification and prioritization may include, along with other
relevant considerations, the value and urgency of vegetation management
projects to: Maintain Nebraska's compliance with obligations on compact streams
and the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program; maintain stream
conveyance for the efficient movement of water and to minimize consumptive
losses; address riparian vegetation congestion in streambeds as a factor
contributing to the frequency and severity of incidents of flooding; and
mitigate degradation of wildlife habitats.
The study shall also identify potential funding sources for riparian
vegetation management projects.
