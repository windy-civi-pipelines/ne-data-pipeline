ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 195
Introduced by Holdcroft, 36.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
review the impact of unfunded and underfunded mandates on counties and county
governments. The study will identify and examine certain programs and services
enacted by the Legislature which have resulted in or may result in an increase
in expenditures of funds by counties and county governments assigned to perform
or provide such programs and services without a corresponding provision of
state funding to carry them out. The study shall include, but need not be
limited to, an examination of the following:
(1) The statutes which presently impose the largest burden of unfunded or
underfunded obligations on counties;
(2) Any corresponding increases in property taxes by counties to meet the
requirements of unfunded or underfunded obligations; and
(3) Mandated but unfunded or underfunded programs or services which could
be changed, eliminated, or repealed.
In conducting this interim study, the Government, Military and Veterans
Affairs Committee may confer with other standing committees of the Legislature,
legislative officers and employees, and other stakeholders.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee of the
Legislature shall be designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the
purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
