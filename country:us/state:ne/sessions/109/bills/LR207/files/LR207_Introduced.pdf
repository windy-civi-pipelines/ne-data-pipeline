FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 207
Introduced by Bosn, 25.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine Nebraska's protection order statutes. Of particular concern is a review
of the history of the development of the protection order statutes and
consideration for how such statutes are being utilized. The study may also
consider whether protection orders issued pursuant to statute can or should be
issued for the benefit of or against juveniles in the state. The study should
consider data and statistics about protection order filings, the type and
number of requests for protection orders made, and potential testimony from
individuals with experience navigating or administering the process to be
granted a protection order.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
