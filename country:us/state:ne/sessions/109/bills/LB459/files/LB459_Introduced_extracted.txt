1 Section 1. (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that
2 Nebraska is experiencing a persistent and present crisis in regards to
3 affordable quality housing, as evidenced by lower inventory than required
4 to support and sustain a healthy housing market. Housing inventory and
5 availability are critical elements in population attraction and
6 retention, workforce development, economic development, and individual
7 family health and economic self-sufficiency. In addition to housing
8 inventory and the availability of homes, another factor that may hinder
9 population attraction is the quality of homes. One measurement of housing
10 quality is age. As such, Nebraska must streamline and maximize all
11 existing housing, weatherization, and home improvement programs to expand
12 access to affordable quality homes and renovate and modernize existing
13 aging housing inventory to meet modern standards.
14 (2) The Home Weatherization Clearinghouse is established within the
15 Department of Environment and Energy.
16 (3) The clearinghouse shall:
17 (a) Serve as a primary contact point for persons applying for
18 grants, loans, or other programs that fund home weatherization projects,
19 whether administered by the department, other state or local agencies,
20 nonprofits, or the federal government;
21 (b) Serve as a coordinator for other state and local agencies
22 administering or applying for any such grants, loans, or programs; and
23 (c) Coordinate efforts by state and local agencies to maximize the
24 receipt of federal dollars for home weatherization projects.
25 (4) The clearinghouse shall have as its primary focus the
26 facilitation of funding for whole-home rehabilitation projects. As such,
27 all grants that accomplish whole-home rehabilitation projects shall be
28 given priority for grant funding to the maximum extent allowed under the
29 relevant federal, state, or local grant program. Additionally,
30 administrative costs for public or nonprofit entities administering such
31 grant programs shall never exceed ten percent of program costs unless
