Approved by the Governor March 17, 2025
Introduced by DeKay, 40.
A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to the Department of Environment and Energy; to
amend section 13-2042, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and section
66-1519, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024; to change
provisions relating to fees and distribution of proceeds under the
Integrated Solid Waste Management Act and uses of and transfers from the
Petroleum Release Remedial Action Cash Fund; to provide an operative date;
to repeal the original sections; and to declare an emergency.
Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Section 13-2042, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
13-2042 (1) A disposal fee of two dollars one dollar and thirty-four
twenty-five cents is imposed for each six cubic yards of uncompacted solid
waste, two dollars one dollar and thirty-four twenty-five cents for each three
cubic yards of compacted solid waste, or two dollars one dollar and thirty-four
twenty-five cents per ton of solid waste (a) disposed of at landfills regulated
by the department or (b) transported for disposal out of state from a solid
waste processing facility holding a permit under the Integrated Solid Waste
Management Act. Each operator of a landfill or solid waste processing facility
shall make the fee payment quarterly. The fee shall be paid quarterly to the
department on or before the forty-fifth day following the end of each quarter.
For purposes of this section, landfill has the same definition as municipal
solid waste landfill unit in 40 C.F.R. 258.2.
(2) Each fee payment shall be accompanied by a form prepared and furnished
by the department and completed by the permitholder. The form shall state the
total volume of solid waste disposed of at the landfill or transported for
disposal out of state from the solid waste processing facility during the
payment period and shall provide any other information deemed necessary by the
department. The form shall be signed by the permitholder.
(3) If a permitholder fails to make a timely payment of the fee, he or she
shall pay interest on the unpaid amount at the rate specified in section
45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted.
(4) This section shall not apply to a site used solely for the reclamation
of land through the introduction of landscaping rubble or inert material.
(5) Sixty-five Fifty percent of the total of such fees collected in each
quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the Integrated
Solid Waste Management Cash Fund and shall be used by the department to cover
the direct and indirect costs of (a) responding to spills or other
environmental emergencies, (b) providing cost share, operation, and maintenance
for remediation of superfund sites in order to pay for nonfederal costs,
including costs for in-kind services, under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 9601
et seq., (c) of regulating, investigating, remediating, and monitoring
facilities during and after operation of facilities, or (d) of performance of
regulated activities under the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act, the
Nebraska Litter Reduction and Recycling Act, and the Waste Reduction and
Recycling Incentive Act. The department may seek recovery of expenses paid from
the fund for responding to spills or other environmental emergencies or for
investigation, remediation, and monitoring of a facility from any person who
owned, operated, or used the facility in violation of the Integrated Solid
Waste Management Act, the Nebraska Litter Reduction and Recycling Act, and the
Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Act in a civil action filed in the
district court of Lancaster County.
(6)(a) The remaining thirty-five fifty percent of the total of such fees
collected per quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to
the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Fund. For purposes of determining
the total fees collected, any amount of fees rebated pursuant to section
13-2042.01 shall be included as if the fees had not been rebated, and the
amount of the fees rebated pursuant to such section shall be deducted from the
amount to be credited to the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Fund.
(b) From the fees credited to the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive
Fund under this subsection:
(i) Grants shall be awarded to counties, municipalities, and agencies for
the purposes of planning and implementing facilities and systems to further the
goals of the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. The grant proceeds shall
not be used to fund landfill closure site assessments, closure, monitoring, or
investigative or corrective action costs for existing landfills or landfills
already closed prior to July 15, 1992. The council shall adopt and promulgate
rules and regulations to carry out this subdivision. Such rules and regulations
shall base the awarding of grants on a project's reflection of the integrated
solid waste management policy and hierarchy established in section 13-2018, the
proposed amount of local matching funds, and community need; and
(ii) The department may disburse amounts to political subdivisions for

costs incurred in response to and remediation of any solid waste disposed of or
abandoned at dump sites or discrete locations along public roadways or ditches
and on any contiguous area affected by such disposal or abandonment. Such
reimbursement shall be by application to the department on forms prescribed by
the department. The department shall prepare and make available a schedule of
eligible costs and application procedures which may include a requirement of a
demonstration of preventive measures to be taken to discourage future dumping.
The department may not disburse to political subdivisions an amount which in
the aggregate exceeds five percent of total revenue from the disposal fees
collected pursuant to this section in the preceding fiscal year. These
disbursements shall be made on a fiscal-year basis, and applications received
after funds for this purpose have been exhausted may be eligible during the
next fiscal year but are not an obligation of the state. Any eligible costs
incurred by a political subdivision which are not funded due to a lack of funds
shall not be considered an obligation of the state. In disbursing funds under
this subdivision, the director shall make efforts to ensure equal geographical
distribution throughout the state and may deny reimbursements in order to
accomplish this goal.
Sec. 2. Section 66-1519, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:

Cash Fund to be administered by the department. Revenue from the following

(b) Money paid under an agreement, stipulation, cost-recovery award under
section 66-1529.02, or settlement; and

intended to be used for the purposes of the fund.

including reimbursement for damages caused by the department or a person acting

(c) fee collection expenses incurred by the State Fire Marshal; (d) direct

under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and

Fund to the Superfund Cost Share Cash Fund at the direction of the Legislature.

and section 66-1519, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are
