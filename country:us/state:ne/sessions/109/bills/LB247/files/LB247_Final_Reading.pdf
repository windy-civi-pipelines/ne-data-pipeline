2 amended to read:
3 13-2042 (1) A disposal fee of two dollars one dollar and thirty-four
4 twenty-five cents is imposed for each six cubic yards of uncompacted
5 solid waste, two dollars one dollar and thirty-four twenty-five cents for
6 each three cubic yards of compacted solid waste, or two dollars one
7 dollar and thirty-four twenty-five cents per ton of solid waste (a)
8 disposed of at landfills regulated by the department or (b) transported
9 for disposal out of state from a solid waste processing facility holding
10 a permit under the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. Each operator
11 of a landfill or solid waste processing facility shall make the fee
12 payment quarterly. The fee shall be paid quarterly to the department on
13 or before the forty-fifth day following the end of each quarter. For
14 purposes of this section, landfill has the same definition as municipal
15 solid waste landfill unit in 40 C.F.R. 258.2.
16 (2) Each fee payment shall be accompanied by a form prepared and
17 furnished by the department and completed by the permitholder. The form
18 shall state the total volume of solid waste disposed of at the landfill
19 or transported for disposal out of state from the solid waste processing
20 facility during the payment period and shall provide any other
21 information deemed necessary by the department. The form shall be signed
22 by the permitholder.
23 (3) If a permitholder fails to make a timely payment of the fee, he
24 or she shall pay interest on the unpaid amount at the rate specified in
25 section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted.
26 (4) This section shall not apply to a site used solely for the
27 reclamation of land through the introduction of landscaping rubble or
28 inert material.
29 (5) Sixty-five Fifty percent of the total of such fees collected in
30 each quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the
31 Integrated Solid Waste Management Cash Fund and shall be used by the

1 department to cover the direct and indirect costs of (a) responding to
2 spills or other environmental emergencies, (b) providing cost share,
3 operation, and maintenance for remediation of superfund sites in order to
4 pay for nonfederal costs, including costs for in-kind services, under the
5 federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
6 Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., (c) of regulating, investigating,
7 remediating, and monitoring facilities during and after operation of
8 facilities, or (d) of performance of regulated activities under the
9 Integrated Solid Waste Management Act, the Nebraska Litter Reduction and
10 Recycling Act, and the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Act. The
11 department may seek recovery of expenses paid from the fund for
12 responding to spills or other environmental emergencies or for
13 investigation, remediation, and monitoring of a facility from any person
14 who owned, operated, or used the facility in violation of the Integrated
15 Solid Waste Management Act, the Nebraska Litter Reduction and Recycling
16 Act, and the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Act in a civil
17 action filed in the district court of Lancaster County.
18 (6)(a) The remaining thirty-five fifty percent of the total of such
19 fees collected per quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for
20 credit to the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Fund. For purposes
21 of determining the total fees collected, any amount of fees rebated
22 pursuant to section 13-2042.01 shall be included as if the fees had not
23 been rebated, and the amount of the fees rebated pursuant to such section
24 shall be deducted from the amount to be credited to the Waste Reduction
25 and Recycling Incentive Fund.
26 (b) From the fees credited to the Waste Reduction and Recycling
27 Incentive Fund under this subsection:
28 (i) Grants shall be awarded to counties, municipalities, and
29 agencies for the purposes of planning and implementing facilities and
30 systems to further the goals of the Integrated Solid Waste Management
31 Act. The grant proceeds shall not be used to fund landfill closure site

2025 2025
1 assessments, closure, monitoring, or investigative or corrective action
2 costs for existing landfills or landfills already closed prior to July
3 15, 1992. The council shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
4 carry out this subdivision. Such rules and regulations shall base the
5 awarding of grants on a project's reflection of the integrated solid
6 waste management policy and hierarchy established in section 13-2018, the
7 proposed amount of local matching funds, and community need; and
8 (ii) The department may disburse amounts to political subdivisions
9 for costs incurred in response to and remediation of any solid waste
10 disposed of or abandoned at dump sites or discrete locations along public
11 roadways or ditches and on any contiguous area affected by such disposal
12 or abandonment. Such reimbursement shall be by application to the
13 department on forms prescribed by the department. The department shall
14 prepare and make available a schedule of eligible costs and application
15 procedures which may include a requirement of a demonstration of
16 preventive measures to be taken to discourage future dumping. The
17 department may not disburse to political subdivisions an amount which in
18 the aggregate exceeds five percent of total revenue from the disposal
19 fees collected pursuant to this section in the preceding fiscal year.
20 These disbursements shall be made on a fiscal-year basis, and
21 applications received after funds for this purpose have been exhausted
22 may be eligible during the next fiscal year but are not an obligation of
23 the state. Any eligible costs incurred by a political subdivision which
24 are not funded due to a lack of funds shall not be considered an
25 obligation of the state. In disbursing funds under this subdivision, the
26 director shall make efforts to ensure equal geographical distribution
27 throughout the state and may deny reimbursements in order to accomplish
28 this goal.
29 Sec. 2. Section 66-1519, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
30 2024, is amended to read:
