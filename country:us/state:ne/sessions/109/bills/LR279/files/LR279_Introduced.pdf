within the Legislature performing the functions generally associated with a
human resources department;

legislatures;

division; and
(4) Examining opportunities to improve procedures related to employee
review and performance and other duties regularly performed by human resources
departments.
In conducting this interim study, the Executive Board of the Legislative
Council may confer with legislative staff, policy groups and experts,
representatives of the Department of Administrative Services and the
Legislative Fiscal Office, and other stakeholders with relevant expertise or
knowledge.
