1 Sec. 3. (a) The Uniform Special Deposits Act applies to a special
2 deposit under an account agreement that states the intention of the
3 parties to establish a special deposit governed by the act, regardless of
4 whether a party to the account agreement or a transaction related to the
5 special deposit, or the special deposit itself, has a reasonable relation
6 to this state.
7 (b) The parties to an account agreement may choose a forum in this
8 state for settling a dispute arising out of the special deposit,
9 regardless of whether a party to the account agreement or a transaction
10 related to the special deposit, or the special deposit itself, has a
11 reasonable relation to this state.
12 (c) The act does not affect:
13 (1) a right or obligation relating to a deposit other than a special
14 deposit under the act; or
15 (2) the voidability of a deposit or transfer that is fraudulent or
16 voidable under other law.
17 Sec. 4. (a) The effect of sections 2 to 6, 8 to 11, and 14 of this
18 act may not be varied by agreement, except as provided in those sections.
19 Subject to subsection (b), the effect of sections 7, 12, and 13 of this
20 act may be varied by agreement.
21 (b) A provision in an account agreement or other record that
22 substantially excuses liability or substantially limits remedies for
23 failure to perform an obligation under the Uniform Special Deposits Act
24 is not sufficient to vary the effect of a provision of the act.
25 (c) If a beneficiary is a party to an account agreement, the
26 financial institution and the depositor may amend the agreement without
27 the consent of the beneficiary only if the agreement expressly permits
28 the amendment.
29 (d) If a beneficiary is not a party to an account agreement and the
30 financial institution and the depositor know the beneficiary has
31 knowledge of the agreement's terms, the financial institution and the
-5-

LB231 LB231
2025 2025
1 depositor may amend the agreement without the consent of the beneficiary
2 only if the amendment does not adversely and materially affect a payment
3 right of the beneficiary.
4 (e) If a beneficiary is not a party to an account agreement and the
5 financial institution and the depositor do not know whether the
6 beneficiary has knowledge of the agreement's terms, the financial
7 institution and the depositor may amend the agreement without the consent
8 of the beneficiary only if the amendment is made in good faith.
9 Sec. 5. A deposit is a special deposit if it is:
10 (1) a deposit of funds in a financial institution under an account
11 agreement;
12 (2) for the benefit of at least two beneficiaries, one or more of
13 which may be a depositor;
14 (3) denominated in a medium of exchange that is currently authorized
15 or adopted by a domestic or foreign government;
16 (4) for a permissible purpose stated in the account agreement; and
17 (5) subject to a contingency.
18 Sec. 6. (a) A special deposit must serve at least one permissible
19 purpose stated in the account agreement from the time the special deposit
20 is created in the account agreement until termination of the special
21 deposit.
22 (b) If, before termination of the special deposit, the financial
23 institution or a court determines the special deposit no longer satisfies
24 subsection (a), sections 8 to 11 of this act cease to apply to any funds
25 deposited in the special deposit after the special deposit ceases to
26 satisfy subsection (a).
27 (c) If, before termination of a special deposit, the financial
28 institution determines the special deposit no longer satisfies subsection
29 (a), the financial institution may take action it believes is necessary
30 under the circumstances, including terminating the special deposit.
31 Sec. 7. (a) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the
-6-

LB231 LB231
2025 2025
1 financial institution is obligated to pay a beneficiary if there are
2 sufficient actually and finally collected funds in the balance of the
3 special deposit.
4 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the obligation to pay the
5 beneficiary is excused if the funds available in the special deposit are
6 insufficient to cover such payment.
7 (c) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, if the funds
8 available in the special deposit are insufficient to cover an obligation
9 to pay a beneficiary, a beneficiary may elect to be paid the funds that
10 are available or, if there is more than one beneficiary, a pro rata share
11 of the funds available. Payment to the beneficiary making the election
12 under this subsection discharges the financial institution's obligation
13 to pay a beneficiary and does not constitute an accord and satisfaction
14 with respect to another person obligated to the beneficiary.
15 (d) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the obligation
16 of the financial institution obligated to pay a beneficiary is
17 immediately due and payable.
18 (e) The financial institution may discharge its obligation under
19 this section by:
20 (1) crediting another transaction account of the beneficiary; or
21 (2) taking other action that:
22 (i) is permitted under the account agreement for the financial
23 institution to obtain a discharge; or
24 (ii) otherwise would constitute a discharge under law.
25 (f) If the financial institution obligated to pay a beneficiary has
26 incurred an obligation to discharge the obligation of another person, the
27 obligation of the other person is discharged if action by the financial
28 institution under subsection (e) would constitute a discharge of the
29 obligation of the other person under law that determines whether an
30 obligation is satisfied.
31 Sec. 8. (a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property
-7-

LB231 LB231
2025 2025
1 interest in a special deposit.
2 (b) Any property interest with respect to a special deposit is only
3 in the right to receive payment if the financial institution is obligated
4 to pay a beneficiary and not in the special deposit itself. Any property
5 interest under this subsection is determined under other law.
6 Sec. 9. (a) Subject to subsection (b), creditor process with
7 respect to a special deposit is not enforceable against the financial
8 institution holding the special deposit.
9 (b) Creditor process is enforceable against the financial
10 institution holding a special deposit with respect to an amount the
11 financial institution is obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if
12 the process:
13 (1) is served on the financial institution;
14 (2) provides sufficient information to permit the financial
15 institution to identify the depositor or the beneficiary from the
16 financial institution's books and records; and
17 (3) gives the financial institution a reasonable opportunity to act
18 on the process.
19 (c) Creditor process served on a financial institution before it is
20 enforceable against the financial institution under subsection (b) does
21 not create a right of the creditor against the financial institution or a
22 duty of the financial institution to the creditor. Other law determines
23 whether creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the
24 beneficiary on a contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a
25 depositor as a beneficiary, even if not enforceable against the financial
26 institution.
27 Sec. 10. A court may enjoin, or grant similar relief that would
28 have the effect of enjoining, a financial institution from paying a
29 depositor or beneficiary only if payment would constitute a material
30 fraud or facilitate a material fraud with respect to a special deposit.
31 Sec. 11. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c), a
-8-

LB231 LB231
2025 2025
1 financial institution may not exercise a right of recoupment or set off
2 against a special deposit.
3 (b) An account agreement may authorize the financial institution to
4 debit the special deposit:
5 (1) when the financial institution becomes obligated to pay a
6 beneficiary, in an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to
7 discharge the obligation;
8 (2) for a fee assessed by the financial institution that relates to
9 an overdraft in the special deposit account;
10 (3) for costs incurred by the financial institution that relate
11 directly to the special deposit; or
12 (4) to reverse an earlier credit posted by the financial institution
13 to the balance of the special deposit account, if the reversal occurs
14 under an event or circumstance warranted under other law of this state
15 governing mistake and restitution.
16 (c) The financial institution holding a special deposit may exercise
17 a right of recoupment or set off against an obligation to pay a
18 beneficiary, even if the financial institution funds payment from the
19 special deposit.
20 Sec. 12. (a) A financial institution does not have a fiduciary duty
21 to any person with respect to a special deposit.
22 (b) When the financial institution holding a special deposit becomes
23 obligated to pay a beneficiary, a debtor-creditor relationship arises
24 between the financial institution and beneficiary.
25 (c) The financial institution holding a special deposit has a duty
26 to a beneficiary to comply with the account agreement and the Uniform
27 Special Deposits Act.
28 (d) If the financial institution holding a special deposit does not
29 comply with the account agreement or the act, the financial institution
30 is liable to a depositor or beneficiary only for damages proximately
31 caused by the noncompliance. Except as provided by other law of this
-9-

LB231 LB231
2025 2025
1 state, the financial institution is not liable for consequential,
2 special, or punitive damages.
3 (e) The financial institution holding a special deposit may rely on
4 records presented in compliance with the account agreement to determine
5 whether the financial institution is obligated to pay a beneficiary.
6 (f) If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a
7 record, the financial institution shall determine within a reasonable
8 time whether the record is sufficient to require payment. If the
9 agreement requires action by the financial institution on presentation of
10 a record, the financial institution is not liable for relying in good
11 faith on the genuineness of the record if the record appears on its face
12 to be genuine.
13 (g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the financial
14 institution is not required to determine whether a permissible purpose
15 stated in the agreement continues to exist.
16 Sec. 13. (a) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a
17 special deposit terminates five years after the date the special deposit
18 was first funded.
19 (b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if the
20 financial institution cannot identify or locate a beneficiary entitled to
21 payment when the special deposit is terminated, and a balance remains in
22 the special deposit, the financial institution shall pay the balance to
23 the depositor or depositors as a beneficiary or beneficiaries.
24 (c) A financial institution that pays the remaining balance as
25 provided under subsection (b) has no further obligation with respect to
26 the special deposit.
27 Sec. 14. The Uniform Commercial Code, consumer protection law, law
28 governing deposits generally, law related to escheat and abandoned or
29 unclaimed property, and the principles of law and equity, including law
30 related to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud,
31 misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, and bankruptcy, supplement
-10-

2025 2025
1 the Uniform Special Deposits Act except to the extent inconsistent with
2 the act.
3 Sec. 15. In applying and construing the Uniform Special Deposits
4 Act, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among
5 jurisdictions that enact it.
6 Sec. 16. The Uniform Special Deposits Act applies to:
7 (1) a special deposit made under an account agreement executed on or
8 after the effective date of this act; and
9 (2) a deposit made under an agreement executed before the effective
10 date of this act, if:
11 (A) all parties entitled to amend the agreement agree to make the
12 deposit a special deposit governed by the act; and
13 (B) the special deposit referenced in the amended agreement
14 satisfies section 5 of this act.
