to the account agreement or a transaction related to the special deposit, or
the special deposit itself, has a reasonable relation to this state.
(b) The parties to an account agreement may choose a forum in this state
for settling a dispute arising out of the special deposit, regardless of
whether a party to the account agreement or a transaction related to the
special deposit, or the special deposit itself, has a reasonable relation to
this state.
(c) The act does not affect:
(1) a right or obligation relating to a deposit other than a special
deposit under the act; or
(2) the voidability of a deposit or transfer that is fraudulent or
voidable under other law.
Sec. 4. (a) The effect of sections 2 to 6, 8 to 11, and 14 of this act
may not be varied by agreement, except as provided in those sections. Subject
to subsection (b), the effect of sections 7, 12, and 13 of this act may be
varied by agreement.

obligation under the Uniform Special Deposits Act is not sufficient to vary the
effect of a provision of the act.
(c) If a beneficiary is a party to an account agreement, the financial
institution and the depositor may amend the agreement without the consent of
the beneficiary only if the agreement expressly permits the amendment.
(d) If a beneficiary is not a party to an account agreement and the
financial institution and the depositor know the beneficiary has knowledge of

the agreement without the consent of the beneficiary only if the amendment does
not adversely and materially affect a payment right of the beneficiary.
(e) If a beneficiary is not a party to an account agreement and the
financial institution and the depositor do not know whether the beneficiary has
knowledge of the agreement's terms, the financial institution and the depositor
may amend the agreement without the consent of the beneficiary only if the
amendment is made in good faith.
Sec. 5. A deposit is a special deposit if it is:
(1) a deposit of funds in a financial institution under an account
agreement;
(2) for the benefit of at least two beneficiaries, one or more of which
may be a depositor;
(3) denominated in a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or
adopted by a domestic or foreign government;
(4) for a permissible purpose stated in the account agreement; and
(5) subject to a contingency.
Sec. 6. (a) A special deposit must serve at least one permissible purpose
stated in the account agreement from the time the special deposit is created in
the account agreement until termination of the special deposit.
(b) If, before termination of the special deposit, the financial
institution or a court determines the special deposit no longer satisfies
subsection (a), sections 8 to 11 of this act cease to apply to any funds
deposited in the special deposit after the special deposit ceases to satisfy
subsection (a).
(c) If, before termination of a special deposit, the financial institution
determines the special deposit no longer satisfies subsection (a), the
financial institution may take action it believes is necessary under the
circumstances, including terminating the special deposit.

financial institution is obligated to pay a beneficiary if there are sufficient
actually and finally collected funds in the balance of the special deposit.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the obligation to pay the
beneficiary is excused if the funds available in the special deposit are
insufficient to cover such payment.
(c) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, if the funds
available in the special deposit are insufficient to cover an obligation to pay
-2-
LB231 LB231
2025 2025
a beneficiary, a beneficiary may elect to be paid the funds that are available
or, if there is more than one beneficiary, a pro rata share of the funds
available. Payment to the beneficiary making the election under this subsection
discharges the financial institution's obligation to pay a beneficiary and does
not constitute an accord and satisfaction with respect to another person
obligated to the beneficiary.
(d) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the obligation of the
financial institution obligated to pay a beneficiary is immediately due and
payable.
(e) The financial institution may discharge its obligation under this

Section 3:
section by:
(1) crediting another transaction account of the beneficiary; or
(2) taking other action that:
(i) is permitted under the account agreement for the financial institution
to obtain a discharge; or
(ii) otherwise would constitute a discharge under law.
(f) If the financial institution obligated to pay a beneficiary has
incurred an obligation to discharge the obligation of another person, the
obligation of the other person is discharged if action by the financial
institution under subsection (e) would constitute a discharge of the obligation
of the other person under law that determines whether an obligation is
satisfied.
Sec. 8. (a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property interest
in a special deposit.
(b) Any property interest with respect to a special deposit is only in the
right to receive payment if the financial institution is obligated to pay a
beneficiary and not in the special deposit itself. Any property interest under
this subsection is determined under other law.
Sec. 9. (a) Subject to subsection (b), creditor process with respect to a
special deposit is not enforceable against the financial institution holding
the special deposit.
(b) Creditor process is enforceable against the financial institution
holding a special deposit with respect to an amount the financial institution
is obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if the process:
(1) is served on the financial institution;
(2) provides sufficient information to permit the financial institution to
identify the depositor or the beneficiary from the financial institution's
books and records; and
(3) gives the financial institution a reasonable opportunity to act on the
process.
(c) Creditor process served on a financial institution before it is
enforceable against the financial institution under subsection (b) does not
create a right of the creditor against the financial institution or a duty of
the financial institution to the creditor. Other law determines whether
creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the beneficiary on a
contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a depositor as a beneficiary,
even if not enforceable against the financial institution.
Sec. 10. A court may enjoin, or grant similar relief that would have the
effect of enjoining, a financial institution from paying a depositor or
beneficiary only if payment would constitute a material fraud or facilitate a
material fraud with respect to a special deposit.
Sec. 11. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c), a financial
institution may not exercise a right of recoupment or set off against a special
deposit.
(b) An account agreement may authorize the financial institution to debit
the special deposit:
(1) when the financial institution becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary,
in an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to discharge the
obligation;
(2) for a fee assessed by the financial institution that relates to an
overdraft in the special deposit account;
(3) for costs incurred by the financial institution that relate directly
to the special deposit; or
(4) to reverse an earlier credit posted by the financial institution to
the balance of the special deposit account, if the reversal occurs under an
event or circumstance warranted under other law of this state governing mistake
and restitution.
(c) The financial institution holding a special deposit may exercise a
right of recoupment or set off against an obligation to pay a beneficiary, even
if the financial institution funds payment from the special deposit.
Sec. 12. (a) A financial institution does not have a fiduciary duty to
any person with respect to a special deposit.
(b) When the financial institution holding a special deposit becomes
obligated to pay a beneficiary, a debtor-creditor relationship arises between
the financial institution and beneficiary.
(c) The financial institution holding a special deposit has a duty to a
beneficiary to comply with the account agreement and the Uniform Special
Deposits Act.
(d) If the financial institution holding a special deposit does not comply
with the account agreement or the act, the financial institution is liable to a
depositor or beneficiary only for damages proximately caused by the
noncompliance. Except as provided by other law of this state, the financial
institution is not liable for consequential, special, or punitive damages.
-3-
LB231 LB231
2025 2025
(e) The financial institution holding a special deposit may rely on
records presented in compliance with the account agreement to determine whether
the financial institution is obligated to pay a beneficiary.
(f) If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a record,
the financial institution shall determine within a reasonable time whether the
record is sufficient to require payment. If the agreement requires action by
the financial institution on presentation of a record, the financial
institution is not liable for relying in good faith on the genuineness of the
record if the record appears on its face to be genuine.
(g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the financial
institution is not required to determine whether a permissible purpose stated
in the agreement continues to exist.
Sec. 13. (a) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a
special deposit terminates five years after the date the special deposit was
first funded.
(b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if the financial
institution cannot identify or locate a beneficiary entitled to payment when
the special deposit is terminated, and a balance remains in the special
deposit, the financial institution shall pay the balance to the depositor or
depositors as a beneficiary or beneficiaries.
(c) A financial institution that pays the remaining balance as provided
under subsection (b) has no further obligation with respect to the special
deposit.
Sec. 14. The Uniform Commercial Code, consumer protection law, law
governing deposits generally, law related to escheat and abandoned or unclaimed
property, and the principles of law and equity, including law related to
capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation,
duress, coercion, mistake, and bankruptcy, supplement the Uniform Special
Deposits Act except to the extent inconsistent with the act.
Sec. 15. In applying and construing the Uniform Special Deposits Act, a
court shall consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among jurisdictions
that enact it.
Sec. 16. The Uniform Special Deposits Act applies to:
(1) a special deposit made under an account agreement executed on or after
the effective date of this act; and
(2) a deposit made under an agreement executed before the effective date
of this act, if:
(A) all parties entitled to amend the agreement agree to make the deposit
a special deposit governed by the act; and
(B) the special deposit referenced in the amended agreement satisfies

Section 4:
section 5 of this act.

to the account agreement or a transaction related to the special deposit, or
the special deposit itself, has a reasonable relation to this state.
(b) The parties to an account agreement may choose a forum in this state
for settling a dispute arising out of the special deposit, regardless of
whether a party to the account agreement or a transaction related to the
special deposit, or the special deposit itself, has a reasonable relation to
this state.
(c) The act does not affect:
(1) a right or obligation relating to a deposit other than a special
deposit under the act; or
(2) the voidability of a deposit or transfer that is fraudulent or
voidable under other law.
Sec. 4. (a) The effect of sections 2 to 6, 8 to 11, and 14 of this act
may not be varied by agreement, except as provided in those sections. Subject

(c) If a beneficiary is a party to an account agreement, the financial
institution and the depositor may amend the agreement without the consent of

(2) for the benefit of at least two beneficiaries, one or more of which
may be a depositor;
(3) denominated in a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or
adopted by a domestic or foreign government;
(4) for a permissible purpose stated in the account agreement; and
(5) subject to a contingency.
Sec. 6. (a) A special deposit must serve at least one permissible purpose
stated in the account agreement from the time the special deposit is created in
the account agreement until termination of the special deposit.
(b) If, before termination of the special deposit, the financial
institution or a court determines the special deposit no longer satisfies
subsection (a), sections 8 to 11 of this act cease to apply to any funds
deposited in the special deposit after the special deposit ceases to satisfy
subsection (a).

determines the special deposit no longer satisfies subsection (a), the
financial institution may take action it believes is necessary under the
circumstances, including terminating the special deposit.

financial institution is obligated to pay a beneficiary if there are sufficient

(c) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, if the funds

-2-

LB231 LB231
2025 2025
a beneficiary, a beneficiary may elect to be paid the funds that are available
or, if there is more than one beneficiary, a pro rata share of the funds
available. Payment to the beneficiary making the election under this subsection
discharges the financial institution's obligation to pay a beneficiary and does
not constitute an accord and satisfaction with respect to another person
obligated to the beneficiary.
(d) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the obligation of the
financial institution obligated to pay a beneficiary is immediately due and
payable.
(e) The financial institution may discharge its obligation under this
section by:
(1) crediting another transaction account of the beneficiary; or
(2) taking other action that:
(i) is permitted under the account agreement for the financial institution
to obtain a discharge; or
(ii) otherwise would constitute a discharge under law.
(f) If the financial institution obligated to pay a beneficiary has
incurred an obligation to discharge the obligation of another person, the
obligation of the other person is discharged if action by the financial
institution under subsection (e) would constitute a discharge of the obligation
of the other person under law that determines whether an obligation is
satisfied.
Sec. 8. (a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property interest
in a special deposit.
(b) Any property interest with respect to a special deposit is only in the
right to receive payment if the financial institution is obligated to pay a
beneficiary and not in the special deposit itself. Any property interest under
this subsection is determined under other law.
Sec. 9. (a) Subject to subsection (b), creditor process with respect to a
special deposit is not enforceable against the financial institution holding
the special deposit.
(b) Creditor process is enforceable against the financial institution
holding a special deposit with respect to an amount the financial institution
is obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if the process:
(1) is served on the financial institution;
(2) provides sufficient information to permit the financial institution to
identify the depositor or the beneficiary from the financial institution's
books and records; and
(3) gives the financial institution a reasonable opportunity to act on the
process.
(c) Creditor process served on a financial institution before it is
enforceable against the financial institution under subsection (b) does not
create a right of the creditor against the financial institution or a duty of
the financial institution to the creditor. Other law determines whether
creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the beneficiary on a
contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a depositor as a beneficiary,
even if not enforceable against the financial institution.
Sec. 10. A court may enjoin, or grant similar relief that would have the
effect of enjoining, a financial institution from paying a depositor or
beneficiary only if payment would constitute a material fraud or facilitate a
material fraud with respect to a special deposit.
Sec. 11. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c), a financial
institution may not exercise a right of recoupment or set off against a special
deposit.
(b) An account agreement may authorize the financial institution to debit
the special deposit:
(1) when the financial institution becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary,
in an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to discharge the
obligation;
(2) for a fee assessed by the financial institution that relates to an
overdraft in the special deposit account;
(3) for costs incurred by the financial institution that relate directly
to the special deposit; or
(4) to reverse an earlier credit posted by the financial institution to
the balance of the special deposit account, if the reversal occurs under an
event or circumstance warranted under other law of this state governing mistake
and restitution.
(c) The financial institution holding a special deposit may exercise a
right of recoupment or set off against an obligation to pay a beneficiary, even
if the financial institution funds payment from the special deposit.

(e) The financial institution holding a special deposit may rely on
records presented in compliance with the account agreement to determine whether
the financial institution is obligated to pay a beneficiary.
(f) If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a record,
the financial institution shall determine within a reasonable time whether the
record is sufficient to require payment. If the agreement requires action by
the financial institution on presentation of a record, the financial
institution is not liable for relying in good faith on the genuineness of the
record if the record appears on its face to be genuine.
(g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the financial
institution is not required to determine whether a permissible purpose stated
in the agreement continues to exist.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if the financial
institution cannot identify or locate a beneficiary entitled to payment when
the special deposit is terminated, and a balance remains in the special
deposit, the financial institution shall pay the balance to the depositor or
depositors as a beneficiary or beneficiaries.
(c) A financial institution that pays the remaining balance as provided
under subsection (b) has no further obligation with respect to the special
deposit.
Sec. 14. The Uniform Commercial Code, consumer protection law, law
governing deposits generally, law related to escheat and abandoned or unclaimed

capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation,
duress, coercion, mistake, and bankruptcy, supplement the Uniform Special
Deposits Act except to the extent inconsistent with the act.

the effective date of this act; and
(2) a deposit made under an agreement executed before the effective date
of this act, if:
(A) all parties entitled to amend the agreement agree to make the deposit
a special deposit governed by the act; and
