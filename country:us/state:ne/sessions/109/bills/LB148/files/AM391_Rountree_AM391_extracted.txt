AMENDMENTS TO LB148
Introduced by Rountree, 3.
1 1. Insert the following new sections:
3 Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. The State of Nebraska adopts the
4 Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact in the form substantially as
5 follows:
6 SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
7 The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the interstate
8 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to
9 dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing Dentists and Dental
10 Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the ability to practice in
11 Participating States in which they are not licensed. The Compact does
12 this by establishing a pathway for Dentists and Dental Hygienists
13 licensed in a Participating State to obtain a Compact Privilege that
14 authorizes them to practice in another Participating State in which they
15 are not licensed. The Compact enables Participating States to protect the
16 public health and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists
17 and Dental Hygienists, through the State's authority to regulate the
18 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
19 A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a Compact
20 Privilege to practice in other Participating States without satisfying
21 burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a
22 License to practice in those States;
23 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each
24 Participating State's acceptance of a Compact Privilege to practice in
25 that State;
26 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and
27 Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for
-1-

AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 Licensees to practice in Participating States;
2 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
3 public's health and safety;
4 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a
5 Participating State;
6 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information
7 among Participating States;
8 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
9 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice within
10 the Scope of Practice authorized in that State;
11 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate the
12 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to Dentists
13 and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a Compact
14 Privilege;
15 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in regulating
16 the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those States; and
17 J. Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses
18 who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

7 Licensee's Compact Privilege in the State;
8 2. In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the
9 Compact and the Commission's Rules, issue subpoenas for hearings and
10 investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and
11 for the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a State Licensing
12 Authority in a Participating State for the attendance and testimony of
13 witnesses, or the production of evidence from another Participating
14 State, shall be enforced in the latter State by any court of competent
15 jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court
16 applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The
17 issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage,
18 and other fees required by the service statutes of the State where the
19 witnesses or evidence are located; and
20 3. If otherwise permitted by State law, recover from the Licensee
21 the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any
22 Adverse Action taken against that Licensee.
23 F. Joint Investigations

25 its Dentist or Dental Hygienist licensure act or other applicable State
26 law, a Participating State may jointly investigate Licensees with other
27 Participating States.

6 Investigative Information had the Licensee continued to have a Compact

1 the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided
2 that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from

13 responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or
14 omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton

8 SECTION 9. RULEMAKING
9 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
10 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
11 provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall be invalid and have no
12 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
13 Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority
14 in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the
15 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
16 review.
17 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each
18 Participating State, provided however that where the Rules of the
19 Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State that
20 establish the Participating State's Scope of Practice as held by a court
21 of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be
22 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
23 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to
24 the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted thereunder.
25 Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for

28 reject a Commission Rule or portion of a Commission Rule, by enactment of
29 a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact,
30 within four years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule
31 shall have no further force and effect in any Participating State or to
-22-
AM391 AM391
LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 any State applying to participate in the Compact.

7 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at
8 least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will
9 hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide
10 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
11 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible
12 platform;
13 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's notices
14 of proposed rulemaking; and
15 3. In such other ways as the Commission may by Rule specify.
16 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
17 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the
18 Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if
19 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
20 Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
21 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, videoconference, or
22 other electronic means, the Commission shall include the mechanism for
23 access to the hearing in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking;
24 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
25 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested
26 person; and
27 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
28 comments.
29 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
30 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to
31 the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.

LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
2 separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
3 convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.
4 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all Commissioners, take
5 final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record.
6 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided
7 the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
8 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
9 substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
10 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
11 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
12 the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L of this
13 section, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty
14 days after the Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended
15 the Rule.
16 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
17 consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four hours' notice, with
18 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
19 provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively
20 applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later
21 than ninety days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes
22 of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted
23 immediately in order to:
24 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
25 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State funds;
26 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
27 established by federal law or rule; or
28 4. Protect public health and safety.
29 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may
30 direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting
31 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or
-24-
AM391 AM391
LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
2 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by
3 any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be
4 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
5 to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
6 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
7 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
8 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
9 approval of the Commission.
10 N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall apply
11 under this Compact.
12 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
13 A. Oversight
14 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each
15 Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
16 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
17 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
18 Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
19 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
20 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
21 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
22 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
23 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for
24 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
25 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
26 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact
27 or Commission Rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a
28 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of
29 process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this
30 Compact, or promulgated Rules.
31 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
-25-

LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025

2 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
3 this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide
4 written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall

6 other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer training and
7 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
8 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to
9 the other Participating States.
10 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
11 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
12 majority of the Commissioners, and all rights, privileges, and benefits
13 conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the
14 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
15 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
16 of default.
17 D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed only
18 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
19 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
20 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's
21 legislature, the defaulting State's State Licensing Authority or
22 Authorities, as applicable, and each of the Participating States' State
23 Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable.
24 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
25 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective
26 date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
27 effective date of termination.
28 F. Upon the termination of a State's participation in this Compact,
29 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees of the
30 State, including Licensees of other Participating States issued a Compact

2 in effect in that State for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after
3 the date of the notice of termination.
4 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that
5 is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact,
6 unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting
7 State.
8 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by
9 petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
10 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices.
11 The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
12 including reasonable attorney's fees.
13 I. Dispute Resolution

15 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among
16 Participating States and between Participating States and non-
17 Participating States.
18 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
19 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
20 J. Enforcement
21 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
22 shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the Commission's Rules.
23 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action
24 against a Participating State in default in the United States District
25 Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
26 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
27 provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought
28 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
29 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs
30 of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies
31 herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
-27-

1 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
2 defaulting Participating State's law.
3 3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
4 Commission in the United States District Court for the District of
5 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
6 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
7 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
8 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
9 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
10 reasonable attorney's fees.
11 4. No individual or entity other than a Participating State may
12 enforce this Compact against the Commission.

15 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Participating State.
16 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission
17 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the States that enacted
18 the Compact prior to the Commission convening ("Charter Participating
19 States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter
20 Participating State is materially different than the Model Compact.

22 materially different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to the
23 default process set forth in Section 10.
24 b. If any Participating State is later found to be in default, or is
25 terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in
26 existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of

28 2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
29 Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in
30 Section 7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are materially different
31 from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the
-28-
AM391 AM391
LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 Compact.
2 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
3 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to
4 the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence
5 shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically
6 repudiated by the Commission.
7 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's
8 initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the
9 Commission's Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the

15 1. A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take effect until
16 one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute.

19 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact
20 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
21 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact,

27 the date of such notice of withdrawal.
28 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
29 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative

1 D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No
2 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any
3 Participating State until it is enacted into the laws of all
4 Participating States.
5 SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
6 A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be
7 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the
8 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
9 Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
10 shall not be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority
11 solely for those purposes.
12 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any
13 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court
14 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
15 Participating State, of a State seeking participation in the Compact, or
16 of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government,
17 agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court
18 of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact
19 and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or

AMENDMENTS TO LB148
Introduced by Rountree, 3.
1 1. Insert the following new sections:
2 Section 1. This section shall be known and may be cited as the
3 Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. The State of Nebraska adopts the
4 Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact in the form substantially as
5 follows:
6 SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
7 The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the interstate
8 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to
9 dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing Dentists and Dental
10 Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the ability to practice in
11 Participating States in which they are not licensed. The Compact does
12 this by establishing a pathway for Dentists and Dental Hygienists
13 licensed in a Participating State to obtain a Compact Privilege that
14 authorizes them to practice in another Participating State in which they
15 are not licensed. The Compact enables Participating States to protect the
16 public health and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists
17 and Dental Hygienists, through the State's authority to regulate the
18 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
19 A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a Compact
20 Privilege to practice in other Participating States without satisfying
21 burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a
22 License to practice in those States;
23 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each
24 Participating State's acceptance of a Compact Privilege to practice in
25 that State;
26 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and
27 Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for
-1-

LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 Licensees to practice in Participating States;
2 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
3 public's health and safety;
4 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a
5 Participating State;
6 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information
7 among Participating States;
8 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
9 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice within
10 the Scope of Practice authorized in that State;
11 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate the
12 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to Dentists
13 and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a Compact
14 Privilege;
15 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in regulating
16 the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those States; and
17 J. Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses
18 who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.
19 SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS
20 As used in this Compact, unless the context requires otherwise, the
21 following definitions shall apply:
22 A. "Active Military Member" means any person with full-time duty
23 status in the armed forces of the United States, including members of the
24 National Guard and Reserve.
25 B. "Adverse Action" means disciplinary action or encumbrance imposed
26 on a License or Compact Privilege by a State Licensing Authority.
27 C. "Alternative Program" means a nondisciplinary monitoring or
28 practice remediation process applicable to a Dentist or Dental Hygienist
29 approved by a State Licensing Authority of a Participating State in which
30 the Dentist or Dental Hygienist is licensed. This includes, but is not
31 limited to, programs to which Licensees with substance abuse or addiction

5 E. "Commissioner" means the individual appointed by a Participating

1 the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided

13 responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or
14 omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton

8 SECTION 9. RULEMAKING
9 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
10 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
11 provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall be invalid and have no
12 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
13 Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority
14 in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the
15 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
16 review.
17 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each
18 Participating State, provided however that where the Rules of the
19 Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State that
20 establish the Participating State's Scope of Practice as held by a court
21 of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be
22 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
23 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to
24 the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted thereunder.
25 Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for

28 reject a Commission Rule or portion of a Commission Rule, by enactment of
29 a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact,
30 within four years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule
31 shall have no further force and effect in any Participating State or to
-22-

AM391 AM391

7 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at
8 least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will
9 hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide
10 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
11 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible
12 platform;
13 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's notices
14 of proposed rulemaking; and
15 3. In such other ways as the Commission may by Rule specify.
16 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
17 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the
18 Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if
19 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
20 Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
21 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, videoconference, or
22 other electronic means, the Commission shall include the mechanism for
23 access to the hearing in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking;
24 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
25 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested
26 person; and
27 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
28 comments.
29 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
30 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to
31 the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.

LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
2 separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be grouped for the

4 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all Commissioners, take
5 final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record.
6 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided
7 the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
8 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
9 substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
10 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
11 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
12 the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L of this
13 section, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty
14 days after the Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended
15 the Rule.
16 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
17 consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four hours' notice, with
18 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
19 provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively
20 applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later
21 than ninety days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes
22 of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted
23 immediately in order to:
24 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
25 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State funds;
26 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
27 established by federal law or rule; or
28 4. Protect public health and safety.
29 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may
30 direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting
31 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or
-24-

AM391 AM391
LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
2 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by
3 any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be
4 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
5 to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
6 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
7 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
8 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
9 approval of the Commission.
10 N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall apply
11 under this Compact.
12 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
13 A. Oversight

15 Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
16 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
17 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
18 Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
19 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
20 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
21 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
22 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
23 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for
24 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
25 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
26 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact
27 or Commission Rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a
28 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of
29 process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this
30 Compact, or promulgated Rules.
31 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination

LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025

6 other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer training and
7 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
8 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to
9 the other Participating States.
10 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting

14 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
15 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
16 of default.
17 D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed only
18 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
19 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the

21 legislature, the defaulting State's State Licensing Authority or
22 Authorities, as applicable, and each of the Participating States' State
23 Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable.

25 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective
26 date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
27 effective date of termination.

29 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees of the
30 State, including Licensees of other Participating States issued a Compact

2 in effect in that State for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after
3 the date of the notice of termination.

12 including reasonable attorney's fees.
13 I. Dispute Resolution

19 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
20 J. Enforcement
21 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,

28 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
29 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs
30 of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies
31 herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
-27-

AM391 AM391
LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
2 defaulting Participating State's law.
3 3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
4 Commission in the United States District Court for the District of
5 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
6 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
7 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
8 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
9 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
10 reasonable attorney's fees.
11 4. No individual or entity other than a Participating State may
12 enforce this Compact against the Commission.

18 the Compact prior to the Commission convening ("Charter Participating
19 States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter
20 Participating State is materially different than the Model Compact.

22 materially different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to the
23 default process set forth in Section 10.

29 Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in
30 Section 7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are materially different
31 from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the
-28-

AM391 AM391
LB148 LB148
AJC - 02/24/2025 AJC - 02/24/2025
1 Compact.
2 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
3 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to
4 the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence
5 shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically
6 repudiated by the Commission.
7 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's
8 initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the

20 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

1 D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No
2 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any
3 Participating State until it is enacted into the laws of all
4 Participating States.
5 SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
6 A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be
7 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the
8 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
9 Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
10 shall not be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority
11 solely for those purposes.
12 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any
13 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court
14 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
15 Participating State, of a State seeking participation in the Compact, or
16 of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government,
17 agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court
18 of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact
19 and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or
20 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
21 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission may
22 deny a State's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
23 requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a Participating State's
24 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
25 requirement of a Participating State is a material departure from the
26 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the
27 constitution of any Participating State, the Compact shall remain in full
28 force and effect as to the remaining Participating States and in full
29 force and effect as to the Participating State affected as to all
30 severable matters.
