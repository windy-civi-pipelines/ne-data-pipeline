38-1101, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024; to adopt the
Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact; to require certain criminal
background checks under the Uniform Credentialing Act; to change
requirements for licensure and reciprocity under the Dentistry Practice

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,

Section 2:
Section 1. This section shall be known and may be cited as the Dentist
and Dental Hygienist Compact. The State of Nebraska adopts the Dentist and
Dental Hygienist Compact in the form substantially as follows:

Section 3:
SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of
dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental
hygiene services by providing Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a
Participating State the ability to practice in Participating States in which
they are not licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to obtain a
Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in another Participating
State in which they are not licensed. The Compact enables Participating States
to protect the public health and safety with respect to the practice of such
Dentists and Dental Hygienists, through the State's authority to regulate the
practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a Compact
Privilege to practice in other Participating States without satisfying
burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a License to
practice in those States;
B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each
Participating State's acceptance of a Compact Privilege to practice in that
State;
C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and Dental
Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for Licensees to
practice in Participating States;
D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the public's
health and safety;
E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a
Participating State;
F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among
Participating States;
G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a Participating
State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice within the Scope of Practice
authorized in that State;
H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate the practice
of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to Dentists and Dental
Hygienists who practice in the State through a Compact Privilege;
I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in regulating the
practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those States; and
J. Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses who
are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any
actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person
against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred,
within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities;
provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such
person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused
by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The

compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.

Section 96:
2. The Commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director,
employee, or representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to
impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission

reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission
employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own
expense; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or
omission did not result from that person's intentional or willful or wanton
misconduct.

Section 97:
3. The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer,
executive director, employee, or representative of the Commission for the
amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out

of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had
a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission
employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged
act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or
wanton misconduct of that person.

Section 98:

SECTION 9. RULEMAKING
A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall be invalid and have no force

invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner
that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each
Participating State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission

Participating State's Scope of Practice as held by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State to
the extent of the conflict.
C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to the
criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules
shall become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for each Rule.
D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating States reject a
Commission Rule or portion of a Commission Rule, by enactment of a statute or
resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, within four years of
the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force
and effect in any Participating State or to any State applying to participate
in the Compact.

Commission.

Section 116:
4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person;

I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written
comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the proposed
Rule shall be available to the public.
J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of
the Commission at hearings required by this section.
K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all Commissioners, take final
action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record.

Section 118:
1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the
changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.

Section 119:
2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.

Section 120:
3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the
Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L of this section, the
effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after the
Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.

consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four hours' notice, with
opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided
in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule
as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the

Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:

Section 122:
2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State funds;

errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public
notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The
revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty
days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in
writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period.
If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.
If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
approval of the Commission.
N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
Compact.

Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary
and appropriate to implement the Compact.

Section 127:
2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission
shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction
where the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission may
waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall
affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.

Section 128:
3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or
Commission Rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for
all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render
a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated
Rules.
B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination

Section 129:
1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State has defaulted
in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or
the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the
defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the default, the
proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the Commission
may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding
the default.
-9-

2025 2025

Section 130:
2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the
other Participating States.
C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State
may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of
the Commissioners, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that
State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or
liabilities incurred during the period of default.
D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed only after
all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to
suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the
majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the
defaulting State's State Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable, and
each of the Participating States' State Licensing Authority or Authorities, as
applicable.
E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.
F. Upon the termination of a State's participation in this Compact, that
State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees of the State, including
Licensees of other Participating States issued a Compact Privilege to practice
within that State, of such termination. The terminated State shall continue to
recognize all Compact Privileges then in effect in that State for a minimum of
one hundred eighty days after the date of the notice of termination.
G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is
found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless
agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.
H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by
petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or
the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
reasonable attorney's fees.
I. Dispute Resolution

Section 131:
1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission shall attempt to
resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Participating States
and between Participating States and non-Participating States.

binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
J. Enforcement

enforce the provisions of this Compact and the Commission's Rules.

Section 134:
2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action against a
Participating State in default in the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and
its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's
fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
federal or the defaulting Participating State's law.

3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the Commission
in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance

may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

this Compact against the Commission.

Section 137:
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
statute is enacted into law in the seventh Participating State.

Section 138:
1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall
convene and review the enactment of each of the States that enacted the Compact
prior to the Commission convening ("Charter Participating States") to determine
if the statute enacted by each such Charter Participating State is materially
different than the Model Compact.
a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment is found to be materially
different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to the default process set
forth in Section 10.
b. If any Participating State is later found to be in default, or is
terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in
existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
Participating States should be less than seven.

Section 139:
2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter
Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section

Section 140:
7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the Model
Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.

Section 141:
3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance
of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective
date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered

LB148 LB148
2025 2025
to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the
Commission.

Section 142:

Section 143:

investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior
to the effective date of withdrawal.

Section 145:
3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, the
State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees
within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the
contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize all Compact
Privileges to practice within that State granted pursuant to this Compact for a
minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or
prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a
Participating State and a non-Participating State that does not conflict with
the provisions of this Compact.
D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No amendment
to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Participating State
until it is enacted into the laws of all Participating States.

Section 146:
SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be
liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation
and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to
limit the Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase,
clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, of
a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the
applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is
held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other
government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission may deny a
State's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of

Section 147:
Section 10.B, terminate a Participating State's participation in the Compact,
if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Participating State is
a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held
to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, the Compact
shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Participating States
and in full force and effect as to the Participating State affected as to all
severable matters.

Section 148:
SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other
law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
Participating State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent
of the conflict.
C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Participating

LEGISLATIVE BILL 148
Approved by the Governor April 14, 2025
Introduced by Hansen, 16.
A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to public health; to amend sections 38-1117 and
38-1120, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and sections 38-131 and
38-1101, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024; to adopt the
Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact; to require certain criminal
background checks under the Uniform Credentialing Act; to change
requirements for licensure and reciprocity under the Dentistry Practice
Act; to harmonize provisions; to provide operative dates; and to repeal
the original sections.
Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. This section shall be known and may be cited as the Dentist
and Dental Hygienist Compact. The State of Nebraska adopts the Dentist and
Dental Hygienist Compact in the form substantially as follows:
SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of
dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental
hygiene services by providing Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a
Participating State the ability to practice in Participating States in which
they are not licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to obtain a
Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in another Participating
State in which they are not licensed. The Compact enables Participating States
to protect the public health and safety with respect to the practice of such
Dentists and Dental Hygienists, through the State's authority to regulate the
practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a Compact
Privilege to practice in other Participating States without satisfying
burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a License to
practice in those States;
B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each
Participating State's acceptance of a Compact Privilege to practice in that
State;
C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and Dental
Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for Licensees to
practice in Participating States;
D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the public's
health and safety;
E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a
Participating State;
F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among
Participating States;
G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a Participating
State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice within the Scope of Practice
authorized in that State;
H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate the practice
of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to Dentists and Dental
Hygienists who practice in the State through a Compact Privilege;
I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in regulating the
practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those States; and

are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

SECTION 4. COMPACT PRIVILEGE
A. To obtain and exercise the Compact Privilege under the terms and
provisions of the Compact, the Licensee shall:
1. Have a Qualifying License as a Dentist or Dental Hygienist in a

the accreditation of dentistry and dental hygiene education programs;

residence on record with the Commission with respect to any action brought
against the Licensee by the Commission or a Participating State, and consent to

record with the Commission with respect to any action brought or investigation
conducted by the Commission or a Participating State.
B. The Licensee must comply with the requirements of subsection A of this
section to maintain the Compact Privilege in the Remote State. If those
requirements are met, the Compact Privilege will continue as long as the
Licensee maintains a Qualifying License in the State through which the Licensee
applied for the Compact Privilege and pays any applicable Compact Privilege
renewal fees.
C. A Licensee providing dentistry or dental hygiene in a Remote State
under the Compact Privilege shall function within the Scope of Practice
authorized by the Remote State for a Dentist or Dental Hygienist licensed in
-3-

LB148 LB148
2025 2025
that State.
D. A Licensee providing dentistry or dental hygiene pursuant to a Compact
Privilege in a Remote State is subject to that State's regulatory authority. A
Remote State may, in accordance with due process and that State's laws, by
Adverse Action revoke or remove a Licensee's Compact Privilege in the Remote
State for a specific period of time and impose fines or take any other
necessary actions to protect the health and safety of its citizens. If a Remote
State imposes an Adverse Action against a Compact Privilege that limits the
Compact Privilege, that Adverse Action applies to all Compact Privileges in all
Remote States. A Licensee whose Compact Privilege in a Remote State is removed
for a specified period of time is not eligible for a Compact Privilege in any
other Remote State until the specific time for removal of the Compact Privilege
has passed and all encumbrance requirements are satisfied.
E. If a License in a Participating State is an Encumbered License, the
Licensee shall lose the Compact Privilege in a Remote State and shall not be
eligible for a Compact Privilege in any Remote State until the License is no
longer encumbered.
F. Once an Encumbered License in a Participating State is restored to good
standing, the Licensee must meet the requirements of subsection A of this
section to obtain a Compact Privilege in a Remote State.
G. If a Licensee's Compact Privilege in a Remote State is removed by the
Remote State, the individual shall lose or be ineligible for the Compact
Privilege in any Remote State until the following occur:
1. The specific period of time for which the Compact Privilege was removed
has ended; and
2. All conditions for removal of the Compact Privilege have been
satisfied.
H. Once the requirements of subsection G of this section have been met,
the Licensee must meet the requirements in subsection A of this section to
obtain a Compact Privilege in a Remote State.
SECTION 5. ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES
An Active Military Member and the member's spouse shall not be required to
pay to the Commission for a Compact Privilege the fee otherwise charged by the
Commission. If a Remote State chooses to charge a fee for a Compact Privilege,
it may choose to charge a reduced fee or no fee to an Active Military Member
and the member's spouse for a Compact Privilege.
SECTION 6. ADVERSE ACTIONS
A. A Participating State in which a Licensee is licensed shall have
exclusive authority to impose Adverse Action against the Qualifying License
issued by that Participating State.
B. A Participating State may take Adverse Action based on the Significant
Investigative Information of a Remote State, so long as the Participating State
follows its own procedures for imposing Adverse Action.
C. Nothing in this Compact shall override a Participating State's decision
that participation in an Alternative Program may be used in lieu of Adverse
Action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the
Participating State's laws. Participating States must require Licensees who
enter any Alternative Program in lieu of discipline to agree not to practice
pursuant to a Compact Privilege in any other Participating State during the
term of the Alternative Program without prior authorization from such other
Participating State.
D. Any Participating State in which a Licensee is applying to practice or
is practicing pursuant to a Compact Privilege may investigate actual or alleged
violations of the statutes and regulations authorizing the practice of
dentistry or dental hygiene in any other Participating State in which the
Dentist or Dental Hygienist holds a License or Compact Privilege.
E. A Remote State shall have the authority to:
1. Take Adverse Actions as set forth in Section 4.D against a Licensee's
Compact Privilege in the State;
2. In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the Compact and
the Commission's Rules, issue subpoenas for hearings and investigations that
require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and for the production of
evidence. Subpoenas issued by a State Licensing Authority in a Participating
State for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of
evidence from another Participating State, shall be enforced in the latter
State by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and
procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending
before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses,
mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the State where the
witnesses or evidence are located; and
3. If otherwise permitted by State law, recover from the Licensee the
costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any Adverse
Action taken against that Licensee.
F. Joint Investigations
1. In addition to the authority granted to a Participating State by its
Dentist or Dental Hygienist licensure act or other applicable State law, a
Participating State may jointly investigate Licensees with other Participating
States.
2. Participating States shall share any Significant Investigative
Information, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or
individual investigation initiated under the Compact.
G. Authority to Continue Investigation
1. After a Licensee's Compact Privilege in a Remote State is terminated,
-4-

LB148 LB148
2025 2025
the Remote State may continue an investigation of the Licensee that began when
the Licensee had a Compact Privilege in that Remote State.
2. If the investigation yields what would be Significant Investigative
Information had the Licensee continued to have a Compact Privilege in that
Remote State, the Remote State shall report the presence of such information to
the Data System as required by Section 8.B.6 as if it was Significant
Investigative Information.
SECTION 7. ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION.
A. The Compact Participating States hereby create and establish a joint
government agency whose membership consists of all Participating States that
have enacted the Compact. The Commission is an instrumentality of the
Participating States acting jointly and not an instrumentality of any one
State. The Commission shall come into existence on or after the effective date
of the Compact as set forth in Section 11.A.
B. Participation, Voting, and Meetings
1. Each Participating State shall have and be limited to one Commissioner
selected by that Participating State's State Licensing Authority or, if the
State has more than one State Licensing Authority, selected collectively by the
State Licensing Authorities.
2. The Commissioner shall be a member or designee of such Authority or
Authorities.
3. The Commission may by Rule or bylaw establish a term of office for
Commissioners and may by Rule or bylaw establish term limits.
4. The Commission may recommend to a State Licensing Authority or
Authorities, as applicable, removal or suspension of an individual as the
State's Commissioner.
5. A Participating State's State Licensing Authority, or Authorities, as
applicable, shall fill any vacancy of its Commissioner on the Commission within
sixty days of the vacancy.
6. Each Commissioner shall be entitled to one vote on all matters that are
voted upon by the Commission.
7. The Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year.
Additional meetings may be held as set forth in the bylaws. The Commission may
meet by telecommunication, videoconference, or other similar electronic means.
C. The Commission shall have the following powers:
1. Establish the fiscal year of the Commission;
2. Establish a code of conduct and conflict of interest policies;

or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property
or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any
actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person

wanton misconduct of that person.

any Licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be
governed solely by any other applicable State laws.
-7-

LB148 LB148
2025 2025

abrogate a Participating State's state action immunity or state action
affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, the

relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative proceedings in a
Participating State.
D. Significant Investigative Information pertaining to a Licensee in any
Participating State will only be available to other Participating States.
E. It is the responsibility of the Participating States to monitor the
database to determine whether Adverse Action has been taken against a Licensee
or License applicant. Adverse Action information pertaining to a Licensee or

SECTION 9. RULEMAKING
A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall be invalid and have no force
or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is
invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner
that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each
Participating State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission
conflict with the laws of the Participating State that establish the
Participating State's Scope of Practice as held by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State to
the extent of the conflict.
C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to the
criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules
shall become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for each Rule.
D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating States reject a
Commission Rule or portion of a Commission Rule, by enactment of a statute or
resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, within four years of
the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force
and effect in any Participating State or to any State applying to participate
in the Compact.

Commission.
F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a
public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data,
facts, opinions, and arguments.

thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will hold a
public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide a Notice of

1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible platform;
-8-

LB148 LB148
2025 2025

proposed rulemaking; and
3. In such other ways as the Commission may by Rule specify.
H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:

the time, date, and location of the meeting where the Commission will consider
and vote on the proposed Rule;
2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, videoconference, or other
electronic means, the Commission shall include the mechanism for access to the
hearing in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking;
3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person;
and

I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written
comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the proposed
Rule shall be available to the public.
J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of
the Commission at hearings required by this section.
K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all Commissioners, take final
action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record.
1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the
changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the
Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L of this section, the
effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty days after the
Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four hours' notice, with
opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided
in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule
as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the
effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency
Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State funds;
3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by
federal law or rule; or
4. Protect public health and safety.

revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical
errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public
notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The
revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty
days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in
writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period.
If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.
If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
approval of the Commission.
N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
Compact.
SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
A. Oversight

Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary
and appropriate to implement the Compact.
2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission
shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction
where the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission may
waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall
affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or
Commission Rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for
all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render
a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated
Rules.
B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State has defaulted
in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or
the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the

proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the Commission
may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding
the default.
-9-

LB148 LB148
2025 2025
2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the
other Participating States.
C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State
may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of
the Commissioners, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that
State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or
liabilities incurred during the period of default.
D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed only after
all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to
suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the
majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the
defaulting State's State Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable, and
each of the Participating States' State Licensing Authority or Authorities, as
applicable.
E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.
F. Upon the termination of a State's participation in this Compact, that
State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees of the State, including
Licensees of other Participating States issued a Compact Privilege to practice
within that State, of such termination. The terminated State shall continue to
recognize all Compact Privileges then in effect in that State for a minimum of
one hundred eighty days after the date of the notice of termination.
G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is
found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless
agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.

petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or
the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
reasonable attorney's fees.
I. Dispute Resolution
1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission shall attempt to
resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Participating States
and between Participating States and non-Participating States.
2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and
binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.

enforce the provisions of this Compact and the Commission's Rules.

Participating State in default in the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and
its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's
fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
federal or the defaulting Participating State's law.
3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the Commission
in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought
may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
4. No individual or entity other than a Participating State may enforce
this Compact against the Commission.
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
statute is enacted into law in the seventh Participating State.
1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall
convene and review the enactment of each of the States that enacted the Compact
prior to the Commission convening ("Charter Participating States") to determine
if the statute enacted by each such Charter Participating State is materially
different than the Model Compact.
a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment is found to be materially
different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to the default process set
forth in Section 10.
b. If any Participating State is later found to be in default, or is
terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in
existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
Participating States should be less than seven.
2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter
Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section
7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the Model
Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.

of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective
date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered
-10-

LB148 LB148
2025 2025
to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the
Commission.
4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial
adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Commission's Rules and
bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that
State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have
the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that
State.
B. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a
statute repealing that State's enactment of the Compact.
1. A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take effect until one
hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute.

to the effective date of withdrawal.
3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, the
State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees
within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the
contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize all Compact
Privileges to practice within that State granted pursuant to this Compact for a
minimum of one hundred eighty days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or
prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a
Participating State and a non-Participating State that does not conflict with
the provisions of this Compact.
D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No amendment
to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Participating State
until it is enacted into the laws of all Participating States.
SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be
liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation
and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to
limit the Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase,
clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, of
a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the
applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is
held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other
government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission may deny a
State's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of
Section 10.B, terminate a Participating State's participation in the Compact,
if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Participating State is
a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held
to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, the Compact
shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Participating States
and in full force and effect as to the Participating State affected as to all
severable matters.
SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other
law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
Participating State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent
of the conflict.
C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Participating
States are binding in accordance with their terms.
