WHEREAS, the Founders of the Constitution of the United States empowered
state legislators to be guardians of liberty against future abuses of power by
the federal government; and
WHEREAS, the federal government has created a crushing national debt
through improper and imprudent spending; and
WHEREAS, the federal government has invaded the legitimate roles of the
states through the manipulative process of federal mandates, most of which are
unfunded to a great extent; and
WHEREAS, the federal government has ceased to live under a proper
interpretation of the Constitution of the United States; and
WHEREAS, it is the solemn duty of the states to protect the liberty of our
people, particularly for the generations to come, to propose amendments to the
Constitution of the United States through a convention of states under Article
V to place clear restraints on these and related abuses of power; and
WHEREAS, in 2022 the One Hundred Seventh Legislature, Second Session,
adopted Legislative Resolution 14 which contained an application for an Article
V Convention to propose constitutional amendments identical to those proposed
in this resolution, but provided that the application would be rescinded on
February 1, 2027, five years after the passage of Legislative Resolution 14.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Legislature hereby applies to Congress, under the provisions
of Article V of the Constitution of the United States, for the calling of a

2025 2025
convention of states limited to proposing amendments to the Constitution that
impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and
jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office for its
officials and members of Congress.
2. That the Legislature adopts this application with the following
understandings, reservations, and declarations:
(a) An application to Congress for an Article V convention confers no
power on Congress other than to perform a ministerial function to call for a
convention;
(b) Such ministerial duty shall be performed by Congress only when Article
V applications for substantially the same purpose are received from two-thirds
of the legislatures of the several states;
(c) The power of Congress to call a convention solely consists of the
authority to name a reasonable time and place for the initial meeting of the
convention;
(d) Congress possesses no power whatsoever to name delegates to the
convention, as this power remains exclusively within the authority of the
legislatures of the several states;
(e) Congress possesses no power to set the number of delegates to be sent
by any of the states;
(f) Congress possesses no power whatsoever to determine any rules for such
convention;
(g) By definition, a convention of states means that states vote on the
basis of one state, one vote;
(h) A convention of states convened pursuant to this application is
limited to consideration of topics specified in this resolution and no other;
(i) The Legislature may recall its delegates at any time for breach of
their duties or violations of their instructions pursuant to the procedures
adopted in this resolution;
(j) Pursuant to the text of Article V, Congress may determine whether
proposed amendments shall be ratified by the legislatures of the several states
-2-

or by special state ratification conventions. The Legislature recommends that
Congress specify its choice on ratification methodology contemporaneously with
the call for the convention;
(k) Congress possesses no power whatsoever with regard to the Article V
convention beyond the two powers acknowledged in this resolution; and
(l) Nebraska places express reliance on prior legal and judicial
determinations that Congress possesses no power under Article I of the
Constitution relative to the Article V process, and that Congress must act only
as expressly specified in Article V.
3. That this application hereby repeals, rescinds, cancels, renders null
and void, and supersedes the application to the Congress for a convention under
Article V of the Constitution of the United States by this state in Legislative
Resolution 14 as adopted by the One Hundred Seventh Legislature of Nebraska,
Second Session, in 2022.
4. That the Clerk of the Legislature shall transmit copies of this
resolution to the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the
Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, each member of
the Nebraska Congressional delegation, and the presiding officers of each of
the legislative houses in the several states requesting their cooperation.
5. This application constitutes a continuing application in accordance
with Article V of the Constitution of the United States until the legislatures
of at least two-thirds of the several states have made applications to Congress
for an Article V convention on the same subject.
