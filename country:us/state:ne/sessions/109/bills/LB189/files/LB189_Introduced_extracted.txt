-11-
LB189 LB189

3 disrupt the operations of the covered employer. In such cases, the
4 covered employer may transfer the covered individual temporarily to an
5 alternative job with equivalent pay and benefits that accommodates
6 recurring periods of leave better than the covered individual's regular
7 job. When the need for intermittent leave is unforeseeable, the covered

11 any one time is one workday.

22 medical leave under the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act is

27 with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions
28 of employment.
29 (2) During any paid family and medical leave taken, the covered
30 employer shall maintain any health benefits the covered individual had
31 prior to taking such leave for the duration of the leave as if the
-12-
LB189 LB189
2025 2025
1 covered individual had continued in employment continuously from the date
2 he or she commenced the leave until the date the family and medical leave
3 benefits terminate if the covered individual continues to pay the covered
4 individual's share of the cost of such health benefits as required prior
5 to the commencement of the leave.
6 (3) The taking of paid family and medical leave under the act shall
7 not result in the loss of any employment benefits accrued before the date

16 medical leave.
17 (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a covered
18 employer from requiring a covered individual on paid family and medical

25 interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to
26 exercise, any right protected under the Paid Family and Medical Leave
27 Insurance Act or to take a retaliatory personnel action against a covered
28 individual because the individual exercised rights protected under the
29 act. Such rights include, but are not limited to:
30 (a) The right to request or use paid family and medical leave;

29 following that provide more generous leave:

LB189 LB189
2025 2025
1 48-652 (1)(a) A separate experience account shall be established for
2 each employer who is liable for payment of combined tax. Whenever and
3 wherever in the Employment Security Law the terms reserve account or
4 experience account are used, unless the context clearly indicates
5 otherwise, such terms shall be deemed interchangeable and synonymous and
6 reference to either of such accounts shall refer to and also include the
7 other.
8 (b) A separate reimbursement account shall be established for each
9 employer who is liable for payments in lieu of contributions. All
10 benefits paid with respect to service in employment for such employer
11 shall be charged to his or her reimbursement account, and such employer
12 shall be billed for and shall be liable for the payment of the amount
13 charged when billed by the commissioner. Payments in lieu of
14 contributions received by the commissioner on behalf of each such
15 employer shall be credited to such employer's reimbursement account, and
16 two or more employers who are liable for payments in lieu of
17 contributions may jointly apply to the commissioner for establishment of
18 a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that
19 are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. The
20 commissioner shall adopt and promulgate such rules and regulations as he
21 or she deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment,
22 maintenance, and termination of group accounts authorized by this
23 subdivision.
24 (2) All contributions paid by an employer shall be credited to the
25 experience account of such employer. State unemployment insurance tax
26 payments shall not be credited to the experience account of each
27 employer. Partial payments of combined tax shall be credited so that at
28 least eighty percent of the combined tax payment excluding interest and
29 penalty is credited first to contributions due. Contributions with
30 respect to prior years which are received on or before January 31 of any
31 year shall be considered as having been paid at the beginning of the
-21-
LB189 LB189
2025 2025
1 calendar year. All voluntary contributions which are received on or
2 before February 28 of any year shall be considered as having been paid at
3 the beginning of the calendar year.
4 (3)(a) Each experience account shall be charged only for benefits
5 based upon wages paid by such employer. No benefits shall be charged to
6 the experience account of any employer if:
7 (i) Such benefits were paid on the basis of a period of employment
8 from which the claimant (A) left work voluntarily without good cause, (B)
9 left work voluntarily due to a nonwork-connected illness or injury, (C)
10 left work voluntarily with good cause to escape abuse as defined in
11 section 42-903 between household members as provided in subdivision (1)

13 for misconduct connected with his or her work, (E) left work voluntarily
14 and is entitled to unemployment benefits without disqualification in

16 (F) was involuntarily separated from employment and such benefits were
17 paid pursuant to section 48-628.17; and
18 (ii) The employer has filed timely notice of the facts on which such
19 exemption is claimed in accordance with rules and regulations adopted and
20 promulgated by the commissioner.
21 (b) No benefits shall be charged to the experience account of any
22 employer if such benefits were paid during a week when the individual was
23 participating in training approved under section 236(a)(1) of the federal
24 Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. 2296(a)(1).
25 (c) No benefits shall be charged to the experience account of any
26 employer if such benefits were paid to an individual who:
27 (i) Worked for an employer for twenty weeks or less to temporarily
28 replace a permanent employee receiving family and medical leave benefits
29 under the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act and who was laid
30 off due to the return of such permanent employee;
31 (ii) Was discharged due to his or her failure to return to work
-22-
LB189 LB189
2025 2025
1 after the expiration of paid family and medical leave taken pursuant to
2 the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act; or
3 (iii) Left work voluntarily while on paid family and medical leave
4 taken pursuant to the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act.
5 (d) (c) Each reimbursement account shall be charged only for
6 benefits paid that were based upon wages paid by such employer in the
7 base period that were wages for insured work solely by reason of section
8 48-627.01.
9 (e) (d) Benefits paid to an eligible individual shall be charged
10 against the account of his or her most recent employers within his or her
11 base period against whose accounts the maximum charges hereunder have not
12 previously been made in the inverse chronological order in which the
13 employment of such individual occurred. The maximum amount so charged
14 against the account of any employer, other than an employer for which
15 services in employment as provided in subdivision (4)(a) of section
16 48-604 are performed, shall not exceed the total benefit amount to which
17 such individual was entitled as set out in section 48-626 with respect to
18 base period wages of such individual paid by such employer plus one-half
19 the amount of extended benefits paid to such eligible individual with
20 respect to base period wages of such individual paid by such employer.
21 The commissioner shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
22 determining the manner in which benefits shall be charged against the
23 account of several employers for whom an individual performed employment
24 during the same quarter or during the same base period.
25 (4)(a) An employer's experience account shall be terminated one
26 calendar year after such employer has ceased to be subject to the
27 Employment Security Law, except that if the commissioner finds that an
28 employer's business is closed solely because one or more of the owners,
29 officers, partners, or limited liability company members or the majority
30 stockholder entered the armed forces of the United States, or of any of
31 its allies, such employer's account shall not be terminated and, if the
-23-
LB189 LB189
2025 2025
1 business is resumed within two years after the discharge or release from
2 active duty in the armed forces of such person or persons, the employer's
3 experience account shall be deemed to have been continuous throughout
4 such period.
5 (b) An experience account terminated pursuant to this subsection
6 shall be reinstated if:
7 (i) The employer becomes subject again to the Employment Security
8 Law within one calendar year after termination of such experience
9 account;
10 (ii) The employer makes a written application for reinstatement of
11 such experience account to the commissioner within two calendar years
12 after termination of such experience account; and
13 (iii) The commissioner finds that the employer is operating
14 substantially the same business as prior to the termination of such
15 experience account.
16 (5) All money in the Unemployment Compensation Fund shall be kept
17 mingled and undivided. In no case shall the payment of benefits to an
18 individual be denied or withheld because the experience account of any
19 employer does not have a total of contributions paid in excess of
20 benefits charged to such experience account.
21 (6)(a) For benefit years beginning before September 3, 2017, if an
22 individual's base period wage credits represent part-time employment for
23 a contributory employer and the contributory employer continues to employ
24 the individual to the same extent as during the base period, then the
25 contributory employer's experience account shall not be charged if the
26 contributory employer has filed timely notice of the facts on which such
27 exemption is claimed in accordance with rules and regulations adopted and
28 promulgated by the commissioner.
29 (b) For benefit years beginning on or after September 3, 2017, if an
30 individual's base period wage credits represent part-time employment for
31 an employer and the employer continues to employ the individual to the
-24-
LB189 LB189
2025 2025
1 same extent as during the base period, then the employer's experience
2 account, in the case of a contributory employer, or the employer's
3 reimbursement account, in the case of a reimbursable employer, shall not
4 be charged if the employer has filed timely notice of the facts on which
5 such exemption is claimed in accordance with rules and regulations
6 prescribed by the commissioner.
7 (7) If a contributory employer responds to the department's request
8 for information within the time period set forth in subsection (1) of
9 section 48-632 and provides accurate information as known to the employer
10 at the time of the response, the employer's experience account shall not
11 be charged if the individual's separation from employment is voluntary
12 and without good cause as determined under section 48-628.12.
13 Sec. 23. Section 71-7611, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
14 2024, is amended to read:

22 FY2012-13 levels.

24 investment shall be invested by the state investment officer pursuant to

4 Treasurer for credit to the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund.
5 Such private donations shall be used to pay the upfront administrative
6 costs and ongoing administrative costs related to the Paid Family and

12 amount shall be repaid to the Nebraska Health Care Cash Fund when the
13 commissioner determines that the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance
14 Fund will have sufficient funds to pay all required family and medical
15 leave benefits after such repayment is made, but in no case shall such
16 repayment be made later than October 1, 2030. The commissioner shall
17 notify the State Treasurer when to make such repayment, and the State

2025 2025
1 family member with a foreseeable serious health condition shall work with

3 disrupt the operations of the covered employer. In such cases, the
4 covered employer may transfer the covered individual temporarily to an
5 alternative job with equivalent pay and benefits that accommodates

7 job. When the need for intermittent leave is unforeseeable, the covered

18 individual to more paid family and medical leave than the individual is

28 of employment.
29 (2) During any paid family and medical leave taken, the covered
30 employer shall maintain any health benefits the covered individual had
31 prior to taking such leave for the duration of the leave as if the
-12-

2025 2025
1 covered individual had continued in employment continuously from the date
2 he or she commenced the leave until the date the family and medical leave
3 benefits terminate if the covered individual continues to pay the covered
4 individual's share of the cost of such health benefits as required prior
5 to the commencement of the leave.
6 (3) The taking of paid family and medical leave under the act shall
7 not result in the loss of any employment benefits accrued before the date

16 medical leave.
17 (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a covered
18 employer from requiring a covered individual on paid family and medical

25 interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to
26 exercise, any right protected under the Paid Family and Medical Leave
27 Insurance Act or to take a retaliatory personnel action against a covered
28 individual because the individual exercised rights protected under the
29 act. Such rights include, but are not limited to:
30 (a) The right to request or use paid family and medical leave;
31 (b) The right to communicate to the covered employer an intent to

17 or family care leave under a collective-bargaining agreement or employer

25 Such additional leave benefits shall not be considered when calculating
26 family and medical leave benefits under section 4 of this act.
27 (4) The Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act does not
28 diminish a covered employer's obligation to comply with any of the
29 following that provide more generous leave:
30 (a) A collective-bargaining agreement;
31 (b) An employer policy; or
-14-

LB189 LB189

7 Sec. 13. (1) Each covered employer shall provide written notice
8 regarding the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act to each covered

29 officers, partners, or limited liability company members or the majority
30 stockholder entered the armed forces of the United States, or of any of
31 its allies, such employer's account shall not be terminated and, if the

15 experience account.
16 (5) All money in the Unemployment Compensation Fund shall be kept

20 benefits charged to such experience account.
21 (6)(a) For benefit years beginning before September 3, 2017, if an
22 individual's base period wage credits represent part-time employment for
