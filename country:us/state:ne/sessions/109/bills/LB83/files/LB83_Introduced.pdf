1 Section 1. This section shall be known and may be cited as the
2 Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. The State of Nebraska adopts the
3 Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact in the form substantially as
4 follows:
5 SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
6 The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the interstate
7 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to
8 dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing Dentists and Dental
9 Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the ability to practice in
10 Participating States in which they are not licensed. The Compact does
11 this by establishing a pathway for Dentists and Dental Hygienists
12 licensed in a Participating State to obtain a Compact Privilege that
13 authorizes them to practice in another Participating State in which they
14 are not licensed. The Compact enables Participating States to protect the
15 public health and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists
16 and Dental Hygienists, through the State's authority to regulate the
17 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
18 A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a Compact
19 Privilege to practice in other Participating States without satisfying
20 burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a
21 License to practice in those States;
22 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each
23 Participating State's acceptance of a Compact Privilege to practice in
24 that State;
25 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and
26 Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for
27 Licensees to practice in Participating States;
28 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
29 public's health and safety;
30 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a
31 Participating State;
-2-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information
2 among Participating States;
3 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
4 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice within
5 the Scope of Practice authorized in that State;
6 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate the
7 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to Dentists
8 and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a Compact
9 Privilege;
10 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in regulating
11 the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those States; and
12 J. Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses
13 who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

6 State's laws, by Adverse Action revoke or remove a Licensee's Compact
7 Privilege in the Remote State for a specific period of time and impose
8 fines or take any other necessary actions to protect the health and

8 Privilege.

11 exclusive authority to impose Adverse Action against the Qualifying
12 License issued by that Participating State.

16 Action.
17 C. Nothing in this Compact shall override a Participating State's
18 decision that participation in an Alternative Program may be used in lieu
19 of Adverse Action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if

4 Compact and the Commission's Rules, issue subpoenas for hearings and
5 investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and
6 for the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a State Licensing
7 Authority in a Participating State for the attendance and testimony of
8 witnesses, or the production of evidence from another Participating
9 State, shall be enforced in the latter State by any court of competent
10 jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court
11 applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The
12 issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage,
13 and other fees required by the service statutes of the State where the
14 witnesses or evidence are located; and
15 3. If otherwise permitted by State law, recover from the Licensee
16 the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any
17 Adverse Action taken against that Licensee.

21 law, a Participating State may jointly investigate Licensees with other

28 terminated, the Remote State may continue an investigation of the

4 8.B.6 as if it was Significant Investigative Information.

6 A. The Compact Participating States hereby create and establish a

16 paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or
17 liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the

19 procurement of insurance of any type by the Commission shall not in any
20 way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.

22 director, employee, or representative of the Commission in any civil

8 responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or
9 omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton
10 misconduct of that person.
11 4. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the
12 liability of any Licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct,
13 which shall be governed solely by any other applicable State laws.
14 5. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to waive or
15 otherwise abrogate a Participating State's state action immunity or state
16 action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the
17 Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, or any other State or federal antitrust or
18 anticompetitive law or regulation.

12 Compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the Rules of
13 the Commission.

3 SECTION 9. RULEMAKING
4 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
5 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
6 provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall be invalid and have no
7 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
8 Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority
9 in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the
10 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
11 review.
12 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each
13 Participating State, provided however that where the Rules of the
14 Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State that
15 establish the Participating State's Scope of Practice as held by a court
16 of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be
17 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
18 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to
19 the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted thereunder.
20 Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the Commission for
21 each Rule.
22 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating States
23 reject a Commission Rule or portion of a Commission Rule, by enactment of
24 a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact,
25 within four years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule
26 shall have no further force and effect in any Participating State or to
27 any State applying to participate in the Compact.
28 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
29 Commission.
30 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a
31 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments,
-23-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
2 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at
3 least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will
4 hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide
5 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
6 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible
7 platform;
8 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's notices
9 of proposed rulemaking; and
10 3. In such other ways as the Commission may by Rule specify.
11 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
12 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the
13 Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if
14 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
15 Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
16 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, videoconference, or
17 other electronic means, the Commission shall include the mechanism for
18 access to the hearing in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking;
19 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
20 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested
21 person; and
22 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
23 comments.
24 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
25 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to
26 the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
27 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
28 separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
29 convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.
30 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all Commissioners, take
31 final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record.
-24-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided
2 the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
3 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
4 substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
5 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
6 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
7 the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L of this
8 section, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty
9 days after the Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended
10 the Rule.
11 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
12 consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four hours' notice, with
13 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
14 provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively
15 applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later
16 than ninety days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes
17 of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted
18 immediately in order to:
19 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
20 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State funds;
21 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
22 established by federal law or rule; or
23 4. Protect public health and safety.
24 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may
25 direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting
26 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or
27 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
28 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by
29 any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be
30 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
31 to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
-25-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
2 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
3 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
4 approval of the Commission.
5 N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall apply
6 under this Compact.
7 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
8 A. Oversight
9 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each
10 Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
11 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
12 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
13 Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
14 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
15 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
16 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
17 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
18 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for
19 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
20 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
21 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact
22 or Commission Rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a
23 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of
24 process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this
25 Compact, or promulgated Rules.
26 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
27 1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State has
28 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
29 this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide
30 written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall
31 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any
-26-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer training and
2 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
3 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to
4 the other Participating States.
5 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
6 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
7 majority of the Commissioners, and all rights, privileges, and benefits
8 conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the
9 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
10 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
11 of default.
12 D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed only
13 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
14 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
15 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's
16 legislature, the defaulting State's State Licensing Authority or
17 Authorities, as applicable, and each of the Participating States' State
18 Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable.
19 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
20 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective
21 date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
22 effective date of termination.
23 F. Upon the termination of a State's participation in this Compact,
24 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees of the
25 State, including Licensees of other Participating States issued a Compact
26 Privilege to practice within that State, of such termination. The
27 terminated State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges then
28 in effect in that State for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after
29 the date of the notice of termination.
30 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that
31 is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact,
-27-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting
2 State.
3 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by
4 petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
5 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices.
6 The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
7 including reasonable attorney's fees.
8 I. Dispute Resolution
9 1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission shall
10 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among
11 Participating States and between Participating States and non-
12 Participating States.
13 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
14 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
15 J. Enforcement
16 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
17 shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the Commission's Rules.
18 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action
19 against a Participating State in default in the United States District
20 Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
21 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
22 provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought
23 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
24 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs
25 of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies
26 herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
27 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
28 defaulting Participating State's law.
29 3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
30 Commission in the United States District Court for the District of
31 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
-28-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
2 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
3 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
4 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
5 reasonable attorney's fees.
6 4. No individual or entity other than a Participating State may
7 enforce this Compact against the Commission.
8 SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
9 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the
10 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Participating State.
11 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission
12 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the States that enacted
13 the Compact prior to the Commission convening ("Charter Participating
14 States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter
15 Participating State is materially different than the Model Compact.
16 a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment is found to be
17 materially different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to the
18 default process set forth in Section 10.
19 b. If any Participating State is later found to be in default, or is
20 terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in
21 existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
22 Participating States should be less than seven.
23 2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
24 Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in
25 Section 7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are materially different
26 from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the
27 Compact.
28 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
29 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to
30 the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence

-29-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 repudiated by the Commission.
2 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's
3 initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the
4 Commission's Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the

6 adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on
7 the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
8 B. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact by
9 enacting a statute repealing that State's enactment of the Compact.
10 1. A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take effect until
11 one hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute.
12 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
13 withdrawing State's Licensing Authority or Authorities to comply with the
14 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact
15 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
16 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact,
17 the State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all
18 Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
19 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to
20 recognize all Compact Privileges to practice within that State granted
21 pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty days after
22 the date of such notice of withdrawal.
23 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
24 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
25 arrangement between a Participating State and a non-Participating State
26 that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
27 D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No
28 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any
29 Participating State until it is enacted into the laws of all
30 Participating States.
31 SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
-30-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be
2 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the
3 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
4 Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
5 shall not be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority
6 solely for those purposes.
7 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any
8 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court
9 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
10 Participating State, of a State seeking participation in the Compact, or
11 of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government,
12 agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court
13 of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact
14 and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or
15 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
16 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission may
17 deny a State's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
18 requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a Participating State's
19 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
20 requirement of a Participating State is a material departure from the
21 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the
22 constitution of any Participating State, the Compact shall remain in full
23 force and effect as to the remaining Participating States and in full
24 force and effect as to the Participating State affected as to all
25 severable matters.
26 SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
27 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any
28 other law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with the
29 Compact.
30 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
31 Participating State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the
-31-

LB83 LB83
2025 2025
1 extent of the conflict.
2 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the
3 Participating States are binding in accordance with their terms.
