FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 246
Introduced by Spivey, 13.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the use of juvenile restrictive housing and room confinement in
Nebraska, including its frequency, impact, and alignment with existing state
law and evidence-based best practices.
The study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Reviewing Nebraska statutes, regulations, and departmental policies
governing the use and oversight of juvenile restrictive housing and room
confinement;
(2) Evaluating trends and operational challenges identified in recent
annual reports from the office of Inspector General of Nebraska Child Welfare;
(3) Researching the psychological and developmental impacts of confinement
on youth, particularly vulnerable populations including, but not limited to,
those with mental health needs or prior trauma;
(4) Reviewing alternatives to confinement, including evidence-based
behavioral interventions, mental health supports, and less restrictive options;
and
(5) Analyzing best practices and oversight models from other states that
have successfully reduced reliance on restrictive housing; and
(6) Reviewing the data collection practices and structures across youth
detention centers and youth rehabilitation and treatment centers on the use of
room confinement and restrictive housing.
In conducting this interim study, the Judiciary Committee of the
Legislature may confer with youth service agencies, detention facility
administrators, state agencies, system-impacted youth, and other partners to
ensure that Nebraska policies align with the best interests of involved youth.
