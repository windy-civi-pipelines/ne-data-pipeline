2 amended to read:
3 76-903 The Tax Commissioner shall design such stamps in such

29 property valuations in the state in accordance with law and to provide
30 the statistical and narrative reports pursuant to section 77-5027.

-8-
LB622 LB622

1 required in section 76-214 is filed shall be available for development of
2 a sales file by the Property Tax Administrator. All transactions with
3 stated consideration of more than one hundred dollars or upon which more
4 than two dollars and fifty-five twenty-five cents in documentary stamp
5 taxes are paid shall be considered sales. All sales shall be deemed to be
6 arm's length transactions unless determined to be otherwise under
7 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques. The Department of
8 Revenue shall not overturn a determination made by a county assessor
9 regarding the qualification of a sale unless the department reviews the
10 sale and determines through the review that the determination made by the
11 county assessor is incorrect.
12 (3) The Property Tax Administrator annually shall make and issue
13 comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of
14 assessment, the degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall
15 compliance with assessment requirements for each major class of real
16 property subject to the property tax in each county. The comprehensive
17 assessment ratio studies shall be developed in compliance with
18 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques and shall employ such
19 statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
20 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The
21 comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file
22 as developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the
23 Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and
24 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property
25 Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by
26 section 79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in
27 establishing assessed valuations.
28 (4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural
29 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections
30 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make
31 and issue a comprehensive study developed in compliance with
-9-
LB622 LB622
2025 2025
1 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques to establish the level
2 of value if in his or her opinion the level of value cannot be developed
3 through the use of the comprehensive assessment ratio studies developed
4 in subsection (3) of this section.
5 (5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically
6 report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property
7 assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the
8 Property Tax Administrator shall deem appropriate. The Property Tax
9 Administrator shall so construct and maintain the system used to collect
10 and analyze the data to enable him or her to make intracounty comparisons
11 of assessed valuation, including school districts and other political
12 subdivisions, as well as intercounty comparisons of assessed valuation,
13 including school districts and other political subdivisions. The Property
14 Tax Administrator shall include analysis of real property sales pursuant
15 to land contracts and similar transfers at the time of execution of the
16 contract or similar transfer.
17 Sec. 11. This act becomes operative on October 1, 2025.
18 Sec. 12. Original sections 58-701, 58-705, 58-706, 58-707, 58-708,
19 58-711, 76-901, 76-903, and 77-1327, Reissue Revised Statutes of

21 costs of the department in administering the program. In administering
22 the program the department may contract for services or directly provide
23 funds to other governmental entities or instrumentalities.
24 (3) The department may recapture any funds which were allocated to a
25 qualified recipient for an eligible project through an award agreement if

14 dollars per homebuyer.

1 Sec. 9. Section 76-903, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 76-903 The Tax Commissioner shall design such stamps in such
4 denominations as in his or her judgment will be the most advantageous to
5 all persons concerned. When any deed subject to the tax imposed by
6 section 76-901 is offered for recordation, the register of deeds shall
7 ascertain and compute the amount of the tax due thereon and shall collect
8 such amount as a prerequisite to acceptance of the deed for recordation.
9 If a dispute arises concerning the taxability of the transfer, the
10 register of deeds shall not record the deed until the disputed tax is
11 paid. If a disputed tax has been paid, the taxpayer may file for a refund
12 pursuant to section 76-908. The taxpayer may also seek a declaratory
13 ruling pursuant to rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the
14 Department of Revenue. From each two dollars and fifty-five twenty-five
15 cents of tax collected pursuant to section 76-901, the register of deeds
16 shall retain fifty cents to be placed in the county general fund and
17 shall remit the balance to the State Treasurer who shall credit one
18 dollar and twenty-five ninety-five cents of such amount to the Affordable
19 Housing Trust Fund, twenty-five cents of such amount to the Site and
20 Building Development Fund, twenty-five cents of such amount to the

22 to the Behavioral Health Services Fund.
23 Sec. 10. Section 77-1327, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 77-1327 (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that accurate and
26 comprehensive information be developed by the Property Tax Administrator
27 and made accessible to the taxing officials and property owners in order
28 to ensure the uniformity and proportionality of the assessments of real
29 property valuations in the state in accordance with law and to provide
30 the statistical and narrative reports pursuant to section 77-5027.
31 (2) All transactions of real property for which the statement
-8-

LB622 LB622
2025 2025
1 required in section 76-214 is filed shall be available for development of
2 a sales file by the Property Tax Administrator. All transactions with
3 stated consideration of more than one hundred dollars or upon which more
4 than two dollars and fifty-five twenty-five cents in documentary stamp
5 taxes are paid shall be considered sales. All sales shall be deemed to be
6 arm's length transactions unless determined to be otherwise under
7 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques. The Department of
8 Revenue shall not overturn a determination made by a county assessor
9 regarding the qualification of a sale unless the department reviews the
10 sale and determines through the review that the determination made by the
11 county assessor is incorrect.
12 (3) The Property Tax Administrator annually shall make and issue
13 comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of
14 assessment, the degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall
15 compliance with assessment requirements for each major class of real
16 property subject to the property tax in each county. The comprehensive
17 assessment ratio studies shall be developed in compliance with
18 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques and shall employ such
19 statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
20 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The
21 comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file
22 as developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the
23 Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and
24 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property
25 Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by
26 section 79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in
27 establishing assessed valuations.
28 (4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural
29 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections
30 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make
31 and issue a comprehensive study developed in compliance with
-9-

LB622 LB622
2025 2025
1 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques to establish the level
2 of value if in his or her opinion the level of value cannot be developed
3 through the use of the comprehensive assessment ratio studies developed
4 in subsection (3) of this section.
5 (5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically
6 report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property
7 assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the
8 Property Tax Administrator shall deem appropriate. The Property Tax
9 Administrator shall so construct and maintain the system used to collect
10 and analyze the data to enable him or her to make intracounty comparisons
11 of assessed valuation, including school districts and other political
12 subdivisions, as well as intercounty comparisons of assessed valuation,
13 including school districts and other political subdivisions. The Property
14 Tax Administrator shall include analysis of real property sales pursuant
15 to land contracts and similar transfers at the time of execution of the
16 contract or similar transfer.
17 Sec. 11. This act becomes operative on October 1, 2025.
18 Sec. 12. Original sections 58-701, 58-705, 58-706, 58-707, 58-708,
19 58-711, 76-901, 76-903, and 77-1327, Reissue Revised Statutes of
20 Nebraska, are repealed.
