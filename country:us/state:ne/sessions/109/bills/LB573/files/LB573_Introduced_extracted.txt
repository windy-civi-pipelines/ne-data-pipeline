2025 2025
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Meat and Poultry Workers and Contractors Protection Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds that:
4 (1) Meat and poultry slaughter and processing is a particularly
5 dangerous occupation, with meat and poultry processing workers suffering
6 injuries at measurably higher rates than workers in other private sector
7 industries;
8 (2) Meat and poultry processing workers face double the rate of
9 amputations as the average worker in private industry, and injuries such
10 as sprains, lacerations, and contusions are common among poultry workers;
11 (3) Meat and poultry processing workers suffer from musculoskeletal
12 injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, tendinitis,
13 rotator cuff injuries, lower back injuries, and chronic pain and
14 numbness, in numbers that can exceed fifty percent of workers;
15 (4) Higher line speeds in meat and poultry processing facilities are
16 recognized risk factors that lead to increased risk of both laceration
17 and musculoskeletal injuries;
18 (5) Meat and poultry processing work was and continues to be
19 particularly dangerous as it pertains to contracting and spreading
20 COVID-19, avian influenza, and other illnesses due to, among other
21 factors:
22 (a) The easily transmissible nature of the illnesses via aerosol and
23 droplets;
24 (b) The close proximity of meat processing workers;
25 (c) Cold conditions inside meat processing facilities; and
26 (d) The pace and physical rigor of meat and poultry processing work;
27 (6) Enforcement of the requirements of the Occupational Safety and
28 Health Administration in the meat and poultry processing industry has
29 been fundamentally inadequate, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic;
30 (7) In 2024, four cases of avian influenza were confirmed in Gage,
31 Nemaha, Dodge, Sarpy, and Lancaster counties, with two of the cases
