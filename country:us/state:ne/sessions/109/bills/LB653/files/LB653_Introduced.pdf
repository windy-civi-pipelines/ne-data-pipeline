1 Section 1. Section 79-238, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 79-238 (1)(a) Except as provided in this section and sections
4 79-235.01 and 79-240, the school board of the option school district
5 shall adopt by resolution specific capacity standards for acceptance and
6 rejection of applications.
7 (b)(i) (b) Capacity for special education services operated by an
8 option school district shall be determined on a case-by-case basis,
9 subject to the requirements of subdivision (ii) of this subsection. If an
10 application for option enrollment received by a school district indicates
11 that the student has an individualized education program under the
12 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et
13 seq., or has been diagnosed with a disability as defined in section
14 79-1118.01, such application shall be evaluated by the director of
15 special education services of the school district or the director's
16 designee who shall determine if the school district and the appropriate
17 class, grade level, or school building in such school district has the
18 capacity to provide the applicant the appropriate services and
19 accommodations.
20 (ii) Regardless of capacity for special education services, the
21 number of applications made by students with an individualized education
22 program under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20
23 U.S.C. 1400 et seq., which are denied by such school district cannot
24 exceed sixteen percent of the total enrollment option applications denied
25 by such school district in such school year.
26 (c) For all other students, standards may include the capacity of a
27 program, class, grade level, or school building. Capacity shall be
28 determined by setting a maximum number of option students that a district
29 will accept in any program, class, grade level, or school building, based
30 upon available staff, facilities, projected enrollment of resident
31 students, and projected number of students with which the option school
-2-

LB653 LB653
2025 2025
1 district will contract based on existing contractual arrangements.
2 (d) To facilitate option enrollment, school districts shall annually
3 establish, publish, and report the capacity for each school building
4 under such district's control pursuant to procedures, criteria, and
5 deadlines established by the State Board of Education. Except as
6 otherwise provided in this section, a school board may by resolution,
7 prior to October 15 of each school year, declare a program, a class, or a
8 school unavailable to option students for the next school year due to
9 lack of capacity. Standards shall not include previous academic
10 achievement, athletic or other extracurricular ability, disabilities,
11 proficiency in the English language, or previous disciplinary proceedings
12 except as provided in section 79-266.01. A school district that accepts
13 applications on a school building by school building basis under the
14 enrollment option program and receives an application for a school
15 building that is at capacity for purposes of the enrollment option
16 program shall notify the parent or guardian that submitted such
17 application of the other school buildings in such school district that
18 are not at capacity and are available to the student for purposes of the
19 enrollment option program. False or substantively misleading information
20 submitted by a parent or guardian on an application to an option school
21 district may be cause for the option school district to reject a
22 previously accepted application if the rejection occurs prior to the
23 student's attendance as an option student.
24 (2) The school board of every school district shall also adopt
25 specific standards and conditions for acceptance or rejection of a
26 request for release of a resident or option student submitting an
27 application to an option school district after March 15 under subsection
28 (1) of section 79-237. Standards shall not include that a request
29 occurred after the deadline set forth in this subsection.
30 (3) Any option school district that is not a member of a learning
31 community shall automatically accept as an option student give first
-3-

LB653 LB653
2025 2025
1 priority for enrollment to siblings of option students that apply to such
2 school district , except that the option school district shall not be
3 required to accept the sibling of an option student if the district is at
4 capacity except as provided in subsection (1) of section 79-240.
5 (4) Any option school district that is in a learning community shall
6 give first priority for enrollment to, and automatically accept
7 regardless of capacity, siblings of option students enrolled in the
8 option school district, second priority for enrollment to students who
9 have previously been enrolled in the option school district as an open
10 enrollment student, third priority for enrollment to students who reside
11 in the learning community and who contribute to the socioeconomic
12 diversity of enrollment at the school building to which the student will
13 be assigned pursuant to section 79-235, and final priority for enrollment
14 to other students who reside in the learning community. The option school
15 district shall not be required to accept a student meeting the priority
16 criteria in this section if the district is at capacity as determined
17 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section except for siblings of option
18 students or as provided in section 79-235.01 or 79-240. For purposes of
19 the enrollment option program, a student who contributes to the
20 socioeconomic diversity of enrollment at a school building within a
21 learning community means (a) a student who does not qualify for free or
22 reduced-price lunches when, based upon the certification pursuant to
23 section 79-2120, the school building the student will be assigned to
24 attend either has more students qualifying for free or reduced-price
25 lunches than the average percentage of such students in all school
26 buildings in the learning community or provides free meals to all
27 students pursuant to the community eligibility provision or (b) a student
28 who qualifies for free or reduced-price lunches based on information
29 collected voluntarily from parents and guardians pursuant to section
30 79-237 when, based upon the certification pursuant to section 79-2120,
31 the school building the student will be assigned to attend has fewer
-4-

2025 2025
1 students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches than the average
2 percentage of such students in all school buildings in the learning
3 community and does not provide free meals to all students pursuant to the
4 community eligibility provision.
5 Sec. 2. Section 79-239, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
6 amended to read:
7 79-239 (1) A school district that receives an incomplete application
8 shall notify the applicant within ten business days after receipt of such
9 incomplete application that the application is incomplete and will be
10 automatically rejected if not corrected.
11 (2) (1) If an application is rejected by the option school district
12 or if the resident school district rejects a request for release under
13 subsection (1) of section 79-237, the rejecting school district shall
14 provide written notification to the parent or guardian stating (a) the
15 specific reasons for the rejection including, for students with an
16 individualized education program under the federal Individuals with
17 Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq., or with a diagnosed
18 disability as defined in section 79-1118.01, a description of services
19 and accommodations required that the school district does not have the
20 capacity to provide, and (b) the process for appealing such rejection to
21 the State Board of Education. Such notification shall be sent by
22 certified mail.
23 (3) (2) The parent or legal guardian may appeal a rejection to the
24 State Board of Education by filing a written request, together with a
25 copy of the rejection notice, with the State Board of Education. Such
26 request and copy of the notice must be received by the board within
27 thirty days after the date the notification of the rejection was received
28 by the parent or legal guardian. Such hearing shall be held in accordance
29 with the Administrative Procedure Act and shall determine whether the
30 procedures of sections 79-234 to 79-241 have been followed. Any rejection
31 based upon capacity limitations established under section 79-238 shall be

7 district and applications related to students with an individualized
8 education program. Such information shall include, but not be limited to,
9 (i) (a) the number of applications rejected in each public school in such
10 district, except that incomplete applications rejected by the school
11 district shall not be included, (ii) (b) an explanation why each
12 application was rejected, (iii) (c) whether each application for option
13 enrollment indicated that the student had an individualized education
14 program under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20
15 U.S.C. 1400 et seq., or had been identified as a student with a
16 disability as defined in section 79-1118.01, (iv) and (d) whether
17 information regarding the requirements of subsection (4) of section
18 79-238 was provided to the applicant, and (v) the number of applications
19 accepted in each public school in such district for a student with an
20 individualized education program under the federal Individuals with
21 Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.

23 information received pursuant to this subsection and provide a report on
24 such information electronically to the Legislature beginning on September
25 1, 2024, and on or before September 1 of each year thereafter. The State
26 Board of Education may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
27 carry out this subsection.

7 district and not the amount received pursuant to section 79-245.
8 (2)(a) On or before October 15 of each school fiscal year, a school
9 district that accepts an application for an option student with an

12 for education and support services of such student that are at least five
13 times greater than the adjusted average per pupil cost of the preceding
14 year as defined in section 79-1114, may apply to the State Department of
15 Education, in a manner prescribed by the department, for a payment from

18 services to such student.
19 (b) The State Department of Education shall make a payment to each
20 qualifying applicant school district on or before November 15 for the

22 shall equal the expected amount to provide education and support services
23 for such student subtracted from the adjusted average per pupil cost of
24 the preceding school fiscal year, except that if the sum of all payments
25 for applicant school districts for such school fiscal year exceed the
26 available balance for such purpose in the Education Future Fund, each
27 payment shall be reduced proportionally so the sum of all payments for
28 applicant school districts for such school fiscal year equals the
29 available balance for such purpose in the fund.
