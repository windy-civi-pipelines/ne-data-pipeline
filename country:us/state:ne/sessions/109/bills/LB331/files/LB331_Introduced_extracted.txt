26 favor of the State of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of
27 state funds so collected. The Tax Commissioner may require any tax
28 official, city, county, or state, to collect the tax on behalf of the
29 state. All persons designated to or required to collect the tax shall
30 account for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax
31 Commissioner. Nothing in this subsection shall be so construed as to

24 subject to the consumption tax at the fair market value of the converted
25 property as of the date of conversion. The tax shall be due as if the
26 property had been sold at the fair market value during the month of
27 conversion. The person using or consuming the converted property is
28 liable for and shall remit the tax on a form prescribed by the Tax
29 Commissioner.

13 for additional expenditures;
14 (5) Each county shall prepare a countywide budget proposal which

27 Sec. 45. (1) There is hereby created the County Trust Fund. The
28 fund shall be used to supply counties and political subdivisions with
29 adequate funds to run their respective operations. The Appropriations
30 Committee of the Legislature shall use the statewide report received
31 under section 44 of this act to determine the amount to be transferred
-51-
LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 each year to the County Trust Fund. The State Treasurer shall transfer
2 money to the County Trust Fund as directed by the Legislature. Any money
3 in the fund available for investment shall be invested by the state
4 investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the
5 Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
6 (2) Each county and political subdivision shall establish a separate
7 bank account for its operations and shall supply the State Treasurer with
8 the bank account number and routing number for such account. The State
9 Treasurer shall use such information to make electronic transfers from
10 the County Trust Fund into such bank accounts each month in a manner that
11 is compliant with the annual budget passed by the Legislature.
12 Sec. 46. (1) There is hereby created the County Stabilization Fund.
13 The purpose of the County Stabilization Fund is to assist counties with
14 additional or unexpected expenditures. The Legislature may transfer money
15 into the County Stabilization Fund as needed, but at no time shall the
16 balance of the County Stabilization Fund exceed ten percent of the total
17 amount transferred for the year into the County Trust Fund pursuant to
18 section 45 of this act. If the balance of the County Stabilization Fund
19 exceeds such amount, the State Treasurer shall transfer the excess to the
20 Cash Reserve Fund. Any money in the County Stabilization Fund available
21 for investment shall be invested by the state investment officer pursuant
22 to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds
23 Investment Act.
24 (2) The Legislature shall have sole authority to determine the
25 distributions to be made from the County Stabilization Fund.
26 Distributions from the fund shall be made annually to each county as
27 nonrepayable grants based on each county's SEND score. Each county's SEND
28 score shall be calculated by the regional representative for such county
29 using the method described in subsection (3) of this section.
30 (3) A county's SEND score shall reflect the amount that a county
31 needs to provide standardized quality countywide services to the
-52-
LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 residents of the county and shall be calculated in the following manner:
2 (a) A public service needs score shall be calculated. The public
3 service needs score measures the amount of revenue a county needs to
4 provide for basic public services, such as fire departments and police
5 departments. A complete list of public service needs shall be included in
6 the manual. To calculate the public service needs score, highways and
7 hospitals shall be excluded from the calculation. All other services
8 shall be included. A five-year average cost per person for such services
9 shall be established. The public service needs score shall be the five-
10 year average cost per person multiplied by the population of the county;
11 (b) A highway maintenance score shall be calculated. The highway
12 maintenance score measures the amount that a county is expected to spend
13 to maintain its streets, roads, and highways. A complete list of
14 expenditures for streets, roads, and highways shall be included in the
15 manual. The highway maintenance score begins by determining the average
16 amount spent per mile each year by the county to maintain its streets,
17 roads, and highways. The highway maintenance score is then calculated by
18 taking the average spending per mile for the previous five-year period
19 and multiplying that number by the number of miles of streets, roads, and
20 highways that the county is responsible for servicing. Streets, roads,
21 and highways that are under the care of a municipality or township shall
22 not be included in the highway maintenance score unless the county is
23 under contract with the municipality or township to maintain such
24 streets, roads, or highways;
25 (c) A hospital score shall be calculated. The hospital score
26 measures the added burden that some counties in Nebraska have for
27 maintaining hospitals. The hospital score begins by determining the
28 average amount spent per person each year by the county for maintaining
29 the county's hospitals. The hospital score is then calculated by taking
30 the average spending per person for the previous five-year period and
31 multiplying that number by the population of the county; and
-53-
LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 (d) The SEND score shall be calculated by adding together the public
2 service needs score, the highway maintenance score, and the hospital
3 score.
4 (4) The regional representative shall calculate and include the SEND
5 scores for each county in his or her region in the comprehensive report
6 submitted to the board under subdivision (8) of section 44 of this act,
7 and the secretary shall include the SEND scores in the statewide report
8 submitted to the Governor and the chairperson of the Appropriations
9 Committee of the Legislature under subdivision (9) of section 44 of this
10 act. The reports shall include each county's public service needs score,
11 highway maintenance score, hospital score, and overall SEND score. In
12 deciding what to fund each year, the Legislature may give preference to
13 counties with an unusually high public service needs score, highway
14 maintenance score, or hospital score. Otherwise, the Legislature shall
15 give preference to counties with the highest overall SEND scores, however
16 each county shall receive money from the County Stabilization Fund
17 annually.
18 (5) For purposes of this section, hospital means any facility that
19 is staffed and equipped for performing surgical procedures or for
20 treating and housing persons with infectious or contagious diseases.
21 Sec. 47. (1) There is hereby created the County Rainy Day Fund. The
22 purpose of the County Rainy Day Fund is to provide money to counties that
23 are recovering from a fire, a flood, a tornado, or any other kind of
24 natural disaster which destroys buildings or structures used for
25 governmental purposes or to renovate uninhabitable properties. No
26 property shall be considered uninhabitable until it has been declared
27 permanently uninhabitable by an inspector designated by the local public
28 health department or county board and has remained uninhabited for a
29 period of no less than one hundred eighty days. A structure may be
30 considered permanently uninhabitable when the structure is unstable and
31 is subject to collapse in part or in whole, the structure is allowing
-54-
LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 elemental intrusion, or an unresolved safety hazard exists within the
2 structure. The Legislature may transfer money into the County Rainy Day
3 Fund as needed, but at no time shall the balance of the County Rainy Day
4 Fund exceed eight percent of the total amount transferred for the year
5 into the County Trust Fund pursuant to section 45 of this act. If the
6 balance of the County Rainy Day Fund exceeds such amount, the State
7 Treasurer shall transfer the excess to the Cash Reserve Fund. Any money
8 in the County Rainy Day Fund available for investment shall be invested
9 by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital
10 Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
11 (2) The County Rainy Day Fund shall be used solely for the purposes
12 of repairing structures, replacing structures, or providing for temporary
13 shelters or temporary structures for purposes of county, municipal, or
14 township government work or work associated with any political
15 subdivision included in the countywide budget. The Legislature shall have
16 sole authority for determining whether distributions should be made from
17 the County Rainy Day Fund, except that whenever the Legislature stands in
18 recess for a period of at least five calendar days following a fire,
19 flood, tornado, or any other kind of natural disaster and the Governor
20 declares a state of emergency, the Governor may by way of executive order
21 withdraw money from the County Rainy Day Fund to repair damaged buildings
22 or structures or to provide for temporary shelters or temporary
23 structures for purposes of county, municipal, or township work, including
24 any work associated with a political subdivision included in the
25 countywide budget. Distributions from the fund shall be made as
26 nonrepayable grants.

17 calculated by the regional representative according to the uniform
18 procedure outlined by the Secretary of the School Equalization and Review
19 Board in the manual described in section 50 of this act. The
20 stabilization scores shall include the following:
21 (a) A special student needs score shall be calculated by adding
22 together the number of students with physical disabilities, the number of
23 special education students, the number of students with learning
24 disabilities, and the number of students learning English as a second
25 language on April 30 and dividing that number by the total number of
26 students enrolled in the district on April 30. If a student fits into
27 more than one of the categories listed in this subdivision, he or she
28 shall be included in the total for each such category;
29 (b) A transportation score shall be calculated by adding up the
30 total number of miles traveled by school buses and parents throughout the
31 school district during the month of April and dividing that number by
-64-

1 thirty. The number of miles traveled by school buses and parents shall
2 include transportation of students to and from school, for field trips,
3 and for after school activities;
4 (c) A technology score shall be calculated by adding up the number
5 of computers owned by the school district on April 30 and dividing that
6 number by the total number of students enrolled in the district on April
7 30;
8 (d) A textbook score shall be calculated by adding up the number of
9 textbooks owned by the school district on April 30 and dividing that

11 30;
12 (e) A poverty score shall be calculated by adding up the total
13 number of students receiving federally subsidized school lunches during
14 the month of April and dividing that number by the total number of
15 students enrolled in the school district on April 30; and
16 (f) The stabilization score shall be calculated by adding together
17 the special student needs score, the transportation score, the technology
18 score, the textbook score, and the poverty score.
19 (3) The regional representative shall include the stabilization
20 score for each school district within his or her jurisdiction in the
21 region-wide report submitted to the board under subdivision (5) of
22 section 51 of this act, and the Secretary of the School Equalization and
23 Review Board shall include the stabilization scores in the statewide
24 report submitted to the Governor and the chairperson of the
25 Appropriations Committee of the Legislature under subdivision (6) of
26 section 51 of this act. The reports shall include each school district's
27 special student needs score, transportation score, technology score,
28 textbook score, poverty score, and overall stabilization score. In
29 deciding what to fund each year, the Legislature may give preference to
30 school districts with an unusually high special student needs score,
31 transportation score, technology score, textbook score, or poverty score.

2 (4) The person purchasing taxable property or services in the State

22 or persons as he or she may deem necessary to be tax collectors and

24 such tax which is due and payable to the State of Nebraska. The Tax
25 Commissioner may require of all persons so designated a surety bond in
26 favor of the State of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of
27 state funds so collected. The Tax Commissioner may require any tax
28 official, city, county, or state, to collect the tax on behalf of the
29 state. All persons designated to or required to collect the tax shall
30 account for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax
31 Commissioner. Nothing in this subsection shall be so construed as to
-8-

LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 prevent the Tax Commissioner or his or her employees from collecting any
2 taxes due and payable to the State of Nebraska.
3 (9) In the sale of new automobiles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers,
4 and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, the
5 consumption tax shall be paid to the county treasurer of the county where
6 the transaction took place. In the rental or lease of automobiles,
7 trucks, trailers, semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the
8 Motor Vehicle Registration Act, the consumption tax shall be collected by
9 the lessor on the rental or lease price.
10 (10) In the case of taxable property or services purchased outside
11 of the State of Nebraska and brought into the State of Nebraska for use
12 or consumption in the State of Nebraska, the purchaser shall remit the
13 consumption tax on a form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Such form
14 shall be made available on the Department of Revenue's website. The tax
15 shall be due the month following the purchase date of the taxable
16 property or services.
17 (11) In the case of wages or salary paid by a taxable employer which
18 are taxable services, the employer shall remit the consumption tax in the
19 month following the date that the wages were paid.
20 (12) Property or services purchased for a business purpose in a
21 trade or business or for sale outside of the State of Nebraska and sold
22 untaxed that are subsequently converted to personal use in the State of
23 Nebraska shall be deemed purchased at the time of conversion and shall be
24 subject to the consumption tax at the fair market value of the converted
25 property as of the date of conversion. The tax shall be due as if the
26 property had been sold at the fair market value during the month of
27 conversion. The person using or consuming the converted property is
28 liable for and shall remit the tax on a form prescribed by the Tax
29 Commissioner.
30 (13) If gross payment for taxable property or services is made in
31 other than money, then the person responsible for collecting and
-9-

LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 remitting the tax shall remit the tax in money as if gross payment had
2 been made in money at the tax inclusive fair market value of the taxable
3 property or services purchased. This subsection shall not apply if the
4 tax inclusive fair market value of the property or services being
5 exchanged is less than twenty-five dollars.

27 Sec. 45. (1) There is hereby created the County Trust Fund. The

29 adequate funds to run their respective operations. The Appropriations
30 Committee of the Legislature shall use the statewide report received
31 under section 44 of this act to determine the amount to be transferred
-51-

LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 each year to the County Trust Fund. The State Treasurer shall transfer
2 money to the County Trust Fund as directed by the Legislature. Any money
3 in the fund available for investment shall be invested by the state
4 investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the
5 Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
6 (2) Each county and political subdivision shall establish a separate
7 bank account for its operations and shall supply the State Treasurer with
8 the bank account number and routing number for such account. The State
9 Treasurer shall use such information to make electronic transfers from
10 the County Trust Fund into such bank accounts each month in a manner that
11 is compliant with the annual budget passed by the Legislature.
12 Sec. 46. (1) There is hereby created the County Stabilization Fund.
13 The purpose of the County Stabilization Fund is to assist counties with
14 additional or unexpected expenditures. The Legislature may transfer money
15 into the County Stabilization Fund as needed, but at no time shall the
16 balance of the County Stabilization Fund exceed ten percent of the total
17 amount transferred for the year into the County Trust Fund pursuant to
18 section 45 of this act. If the balance of the County Stabilization Fund
19 exceeds such amount, the State Treasurer shall transfer the excess to the
20 Cash Reserve Fund. Any money in the County Stabilization Fund available
21 for investment shall be invested by the state investment officer pursuant
22 to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds
23 Investment Act.
24 (2) The Legislature shall have sole authority to determine the
25 distributions to be made from the County Stabilization Fund.
26 Distributions from the fund shall be made annually to each county as
27 nonrepayable grants based on each county's SEND score. Each county's SEND
28 score shall be calculated by the regional representative for such county
29 using the method described in subsection (3) of this section.
30 (3) A county's SEND score shall reflect the amount that a county
31 needs to provide standardized quality countywide services to the
-52-

LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 residents of the county and shall be calculated in the following manner:
2 (a) A public service needs score shall be calculated. The public
3 service needs score measures the amount of revenue a county needs to
4 provide for basic public services, such as fire departments and police
5 departments. A complete list of public service needs shall be included in
6 the manual. To calculate the public service needs score, highways and
7 hospitals shall be excluded from the calculation. All other services
8 shall be included. A five-year average cost per person for such services
9 shall be established. The public service needs score shall be the five-
10 year average cost per person multiplied by the population of the county;
11 (b) A highway maintenance score shall be calculated. The highway
12 maintenance score measures the amount that a county is expected to spend
13 to maintain its streets, roads, and highways. A complete list of
14 expenditures for streets, roads, and highways shall be included in the
15 manual. The highway maintenance score begins by determining the average
16 amount spent per mile each year by the county to maintain its streets,
17 roads, and highways. The highway maintenance score is then calculated by
18 taking the average spending per mile for the previous five-year period
19 and multiplying that number by the number of miles of streets, roads, and
20 highways that the county is responsible for servicing. Streets, roads,
21 and highways that are under the care of a municipality or township shall
22 not be included in the highway maintenance score unless the county is
23 under contract with the municipality or township to maintain such
24 streets, roads, or highways;
25 (c) A hospital score shall be calculated. The hospital score
26 measures the added burden that some counties in Nebraska have for
27 maintaining hospitals. The hospital score begins by determining the
28 average amount spent per person each year by the county for maintaining
29 the county's hospitals. The hospital score is then calculated by taking
30 the average spending per person for the previous five-year period and
31 multiplying that number by the population of the county; and
-53-

LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 (d) The SEND score shall be calculated by adding together the public
2 service needs score, the highway maintenance score, and the hospital
3 score.
4 (4) The regional representative shall calculate and include the SEND
5 scores for each county in his or her region in the comprehensive report
6 submitted to the board under subdivision (8) of section 44 of this act,
7 and the secretary shall include the SEND scores in the statewide report
8 submitted to the Governor and the chairperson of the Appropriations
9 Committee of the Legislature under subdivision (9) of section 44 of this
10 act. The reports shall include each county's public service needs score,
11 highway maintenance score, hospital score, and overall SEND score. In
12 deciding what to fund each year, the Legislature may give preference to
13 counties with an unusually high public service needs score, highway
14 maintenance score, or hospital score. Otherwise, the Legislature shall
15 give preference to counties with the highest overall SEND scores, however
16 each county shall receive money from the County Stabilization Fund
17 annually.
18 (5) For purposes of this section, hospital means any facility that
19 is staffed and equipped for performing surgical procedures or for
20 treating and housing persons with infectious or contagious diseases.
21 Sec. 47. (1) There is hereby created the County Rainy Day Fund. The
22 purpose of the County Rainy Day Fund is to provide money to counties that
23 are recovering from a fire, a flood, a tornado, or any other kind of
24 natural disaster which destroys buildings or structures used for
25 governmental purposes or to renovate uninhabitable properties. No
26 property shall be considered uninhabitable until it has been declared
27 permanently uninhabitable by an inspector designated by the local public
28 health department or county board and has remained uninhabited for a
29 period of no less than one hundred eighty days. A structure may be
30 considered permanently uninhabitable when the structure is unstable and
31 is subject to collapse in part or in whole, the structure is allowing
-54-

LB331 LB331
2025 2025
1 elemental intrusion, or an unresolved safety hazard exists within the
2 structure. The Legislature may transfer money into the County Rainy Day
3 Fund as needed, but at no time shall the balance of the County Rainy Day
4 Fund exceed eight percent of the total amount transferred for the year
5 into the County Trust Fund pursuant to section 45 of this act. If the
6 balance of the County Rainy Day Fund exceeds such amount, the State
7 Treasurer shall transfer the excess to the Cash Reserve Fund. Any money
8 in the County Rainy Day Fund available for investment shall be invested
9 by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital
10 Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
11 (2) The County Rainy Day Fund shall be used solely for the purposes
12 of repairing structures, replacing structures, or providing for temporary
13 shelters or temporary structures for purposes of county, municipal, or
14 township government work or work associated with any political
15 subdivision included in the countywide budget. The Legislature shall have
16 sole authority for determining whether distributions should be made from
17 the County Rainy Day Fund, except that whenever the Legislature stands in
18 recess for a period of at least five calendar days following a fire,
19 flood, tornado, or any other kind of natural disaster and the Governor
20 declares a state of emergency, the Governor may by way of executive order
21 withdraw money from the County Rainy Day Fund to repair damaged buildings
22 or structures or to provide for temporary shelters or temporary
23 structures for purposes of county, municipal, or township work, including
24 any work associated with a political subdivision included in the
25 countywide budget. Distributions from the fund shall be made as
26 nonrepayable grants.

28 shall be included in the total for each such category;

13 number of students receiving federally subsidized school lunches during
14 the month of April and dividing that number by the total number of

16 (f) The stabilization score shall be calculated by adding together
17 the special student needs score, the transportation score, the technology
18 score, the textbook score, and the poverty score.
19 (3) The regional representative shall include the stabilization
20 score for each school district within his or her jurisdiction in the
21 region-wide report submitted to the board under subdivision (5) of

23 Review Board shall include the stabilization scores in the statewide
24 report submitted to the Governor and the chairperson of the
25 Appropriations Committee of the Legislature under subdivision (6) of
26 section 51 of this act. The reports shall include each school district's
27 special student needs score, transportation score, technology score,
28 textbook score, poverty score, and overall stabilization score. In
29 deciding what to fund each year, the Legislature may give preference to
30 school districts with an unusually high special student needs score,
