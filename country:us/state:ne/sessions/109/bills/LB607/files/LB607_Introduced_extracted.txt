19 imposed for each six cubic yards of uncompacted solid waste, one dollar
20 and twenty-five cents for each three cubic yards of compacted solid
21 waste, and or one dollar and twenty-five cents per ton of solid waste (a)
22 disposed of at landfills regulated by the department or (b) transported
23 for disposal out of state from a solid waste processing facility holding
24 a permit under the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. Each operator
25 of a landfill or solid waste processing facility shall make the fee
26 payment quarterly. The fee shall be paid quarterly to the department on
27 or before the forty-fifth day following the end of each quarter. For
28 purposes of this section, landfill has the same definition as municipal
29 solid waste landfill unit in 40 C.F.R. 258.2.
30 (2) Each fee payment shall be accompanied by a form prepared and
31 furnished by the department and completed by the permitholder. The form
-6-
LB607 LB607
2025 2025
1 shall state the total volume of solid waste disposed of at the landfill

9 (4) This section shall not apply to a site used solely for the
10 reclamation of land through the introduction of landscaping rubble or
11 inert material.
12 (5) Fifty percent of the total of such fees collected in each
13 quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the
14 Integrated Solid Waste Management Cash Fund and shall be used by the
15 department to cover the direct and indirect costs of responding to spills
16 or other environmental emergencies, of regulating, investigating,
17 remediating, and monitoring facilities during and after operation of
18 facilities, or of performance of regulated activities under the
19 Integrated Solid Waste Management Act, the Nebraska Litter Reduction and
20 Recycling Act, and the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Act. The
21 department may seek recovery of expenses paid from the fund for
22 responding to spills or other environmental emergencies or for
23 investigation, remediation, and monitoring of a facility from any person
24 who owned, operated, or used the facility in violation of the Integrated
25 Solid Waste Management Act, the Nebraska Litter Reduction and Recycling
26 Act, and the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Act in a civil
27 action filed in the district court of Lancaster County.
28 (6)(a) The remaining fifty percent of the total of such fees
29 collected per quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit
30 to the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Fund. For purposes of

7 (i) Grants shall be awarded to counties, municipalities, and
8 agencies, and private businesses for the purposes of planning and
9 implementing facilities and systems to further the goals of the
10 Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. The grant proceeds shall not be
11 used to fund landfill closure site assessments, closure, monitoring, or
12 investigative or corrective action costs for existing landfills or
13 landfills already closed prior to July 15, 1992. The council shall adopt
14 and promulgate rules and regulations to carry out this subdivision. Such
15 rules and regulations shall base the awarding of grants on a project's
16 reflection of the integrated solid waste management policy and hierarchy
17 established in section 13-2018, the proposed amount of local matching
18 funds, and community need; and
19 (ii) The department may disburse amounts to political subdivisions
20 for costs incurred in response to and remediation of any solid waste
21 disposed of or abandoned at dump sites or discrete locations along public
22 roadways or ditches and on any contiguous area affected by such disposal
23 or abandonment. Such reimbursement shall be by application to the
24 department on forms prescribed by the department. The department shall
25 prepare and make available a schedule of eligible costs and application
26 procedures which may include a requirement of a demonstration of
27 preventive measures to be taken to discourage future dumping. The
28 department may not disburse to political subdivisions an amount which in
29 the aggregate exceeds five percent of total revenue from the disposal
30 fees collected pursuant to this section in the preceding fiscal year.
31 These disbursements shall be made on a fiscal-year basis, and
-8-
LB607 LB607
2025 2025
1 applications received after funds for this purpose have been exhausted
2 may be eligible during the next fiscal year but are not an obligation of
3 the state. Any eligible costs incurred by a political subdivision which
4 are not funded due to a lack of funds shall not be considered an
5 obligation of the state. In disbursing funds under this subdivision, the
6 director shall make efforts to ensure equal geographical distribution
7 throughout the state and may deny reimbursements in order to accomplish
8 this goal.
9 (7) The disposal fee shall be:
10 (a) Beginning January 1, 2026, and on or before December 31, 2026,
11 two dollars and twenty-five cents;
12 (b) Beginning January 1, 2027, and on or before December 31, 2027,
13 three dollars and twenty-five cents; and
14 (c) Beginning January 1, 2028, four dollars and twenty-five cents.
15 Sec. 17. The owner or operator of a manufacturing facility shall be
16 responsible for the proper disposal of all post-use polymers or recovered
17 feedstocks stored on the premises of such manufacturing facility within
18 sixty days after ceasing manufacturing operations.
19 Sec. 18. Manufacturing facilities are subject to applicable
20 Department of Environment and Energy manufacturing rules and regulations
21 for air, water, waste, and land use.
22 Sec. 19. Sections 19 to 37 of this act shall be known and may be
23 cited as the Environmental Stewardship of Batteries Act.
24 Sec. 20. The Legislature finds that:
25 (1) It is in the public interest of the residents of Nebraska to
26 encourage the recovery and reuse of materials, such as metals, that
27 replace the output of mining and other extractive industries;
28 (2) Without a dedicated battery stewardship program, battery user
29 confusion regarding proper disposal options will continue to persist;
30 (3) Ensuring the proper handling, recycling, and end-of-life
31 management of used batteries prevents the release of toxic materials into
-9-
LB607 LB607
2025 2025
1 the environment and removes materials from the waste stream that, if
2 mishandled, may present safety concerns to workers, such as by igniting
3 fires at solid waste handling facilities. For this reason, batteries
4 should not be placed into commingled recycling containers or disposed of
5 via traditional garbage collection containers; and
6 (4) Jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented
7 battery stewardship laws that have helped address the challenges posed by
8 the end-of-life management of batteries. Because it is difficult for
9 customers to differentiate between types and chemistries of batteries, it
10 is the best practice for battery stewardship programs to collect all
11 battery types and chemistries. Furthermore, it is appropriate for larger
12 batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles,
13 solar power arrays, and data centers, to be managed to ensure
14 environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery
15 stewardship program, both because of the potential economic value of
16 large batteries used for these purposes and the anticipated profusion of
17 these larger batteries as these market sectors mature.
18 Sec. 21. For purposes of the Environmental Stewardship of Batteries
19 Act, unless the context otherwise requires:
20 (1) Battery-containing product means a product that contains or is
21 packaged with rechargeable or primary batteries that are covered
22 batteries;
23 (2) Battery management hierarchy means a management system of
24 covered batteries prioritized in descending order as follows:
25 (a) Waste prevention and reduction;
26 (b) Reuse, when reuse is appropriate;

20 and twenty-five cents for each three cubic yards of compacted solid
21 waste, and or one dollar and twenty-five cents per ton of solid waste (a)
22 disposed of at landfills regulated by the department or (b) transported
23 for disposal out of state from a solid waste processing facility holding
24 a permit under the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. Each operator
25 of a landfill or solid waste processing facility shall make the fee
26 payment quarterly. The fee shall be paid quarterly to the department on
27 or before the forty-fifth day following the end of each quarter. For
28 purposes of this section, landfill has the same definition as municipal
29 solid waste landfill unit in 40 C.F.R. 258.2.
30 (2) Each fee payment shall be accompanied by a form prepared and
31 furnished by the department and completed by the permitholder. The form

9 (4) This section shall not apply to a site used solely for the
10 reclamation of land through the introduction of landscaping rubble or
11 inert material.
12 (5) Fifty percent of the total of such fees collected in each
13 quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the
14 Integrated Solid Waste Management Cash Fund and shall be used by the
15 department to cover the direct and indirect costs of responding to spills
16 or other environmental emergencies, of regulating, investigating,
17 remediating, and monitoring facilities during and after operation of
18 facilities, or of performance of regulated activities under the
19 Integrated Solid Waste Management Act, the Nebraska Litter Reduction and
20 Recycling Act, and the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Act. The
21 department may seek recovery of expenses paid from the fund for
22 responding to spills or other environmental emergencies or for
23 investigation, remediation, and monitoring of a facility from any person
24 who owned, operated, or used the facility in violation of the Integrated
25 Solid Waste Management Act, the Nebraska Litter Reduction and Recycling
26 Act, and the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Act in a civil
27 action filed in the district court of Lancaster County.
28 (6)(a) The remaining fifty percent of the total of such fees
29 collected per quarter shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for credit
30 to the Waste Reduction and Recycling Incentive Fund. For purposes of

-7-

LB607 LB607
2025 2025
1 to section 13-2042.01 shall be included as if the fees had not been
2 rebated, and the amount of the fees rebated pursuant to such section
3 shall be deducted from the amount to be credited to the Waste Reduction
4 and Recycling Incentive Fund.
5 (b) From the fees credited to the Waste Reduction and Recycling
6 Incentive Fund under this subsection:
7 (i) Grants shall be awarded to counties, municipalities, and
8 agencies, and private businesses for the purposes of planning and
9 implementing facilities and systems to further the goals of the
10 Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. The grant proceeds shall not be
11 used to fund landfill closure site assessments, closure, monitoring, or
12 investigative or corrective action costs for existing landfills or
13 landfills already closed prior to July 15, 1992. The council shall adopt
14 and promulgate rules and regulations to carry out this subdivision. Such
15 rules and regulations shall base the awarding of grants on a project's
16 reflection of the integrated solid waste management policy and hierarchy
17 established in section 13-2018, the proposed amount of local matching
18 funds, and community need; and
19 (ii) The department may disburse amounts to political subdivisions
20 for costs incurred in response to and remediation of any solid waste
21 disposed of or abandoned at dump sites or discrete locations along public
22 roadways or ditches and on any contiguous area affected by such disposal
23 or abandonment. Such reimbursement shall be by application to the
24 department on forms prescribed by the department. The department shall
25 prepare and make available a schedule of eligible costs and application
26 procedures which may include a requirement of a demonstration of
27 preventive measures to be taken to discourage future dumping. The
28 department may not disburse to political subdivisions an amount which in
29 the aggregate exceeds five percent of total revenue from the disposal
30 fees collected pursuant to this section in the preceding fiscal year.
31 These disbursements shall be made on a fiscal-year basis, and
-8-

LB607 LB607
2025 2025
1 applications received after funds for this purpose have been exhausted
2 may be eligible during the next fiscal year but are not an obligation of
3 the state. Any eligible costs incurred by a political subdivision which
4 are not funded due to a lack of funds shall not be considered an
5 obligation of the state. In disbursing funds under this subdivision, the
6 director shall make efforts to ensure equal geographical distribution
7 throughout the state and may deny reimbursements in order to accomplish
8 this goal.
9 (7) The disposal fee shall be:
10 (a) Beginning January 1, 2026, and on or before December 31, 2026,
11 two dollars and twenty-five cents;
12 (b) Beginning January 1, 2027, and on or before December 31, 2027,
13 three dollars and twenty-five cents; and
14 (c) Beginning January 1, 2028, four dollars and twenty-five cents.
15 Sec. 17. The owner or operator of a manufacturing facility shall be
16 responsible for the proper disposal of all post-use polymers or recovered
17 feedstocks stored on the premises of such manufacturing facility within
18 sixty days after ceasing manufacturing operations.
19 Sec. 18. Manufacturing facilities are subject to applicable
20 Department of Environment and Energy manufacturing rules and regulations
21 for air, water, waste, and land use.
22 Sec. 19. Sections 19 to 37 of this act shall be known and may be
23 cited as the Environmental Stewardship of Batteries Act.
24 Sec. 20. The Legislature finds that:
25 (1) It is in the public interest of the residents of Nebraska to
26 encourage the recovery and reuse of materials, such as metals, that
27 replace the output of mining and other extractive industries;
28 (2) Without a dedicated battery stewardship program, battery user
29 confusion regarding proper disposal options will continue to persist;
30 (3) Ensuring the proper handling, recycling, and end-of-life
31 management of used batteries prevents the release of toxic materials into
-9-

LB607 LB607
2025 2025
1 the environment and removes materials from the waste stream that, if
2 mishandled, may present safety concerns to workers, such as by igniting
3 fires at solid waste handling facilities. For this reason, batteries
4 should not be placed into commingled recycling containers or disposed of
5 via traditional garbage collection containers; and
6 (4) Jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented
7 battery stewardship laws that have helped address the challenges posed by
8 the end-of-life management of batteries. Because it is difficult for
9 customers to differentiate between types and chemistries of batteries, it
10 is the best practice for battery stewardship programs to collect all
11 battery types and chemistries. Furthermore, it is appropriate for larger
12 batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles,
13 solar power arrays, and data centers, to be managed to ensure
14 environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery
15 stewardship program, both because of the potential economic value of
16 large batteries used for these purposes and the anticipated profusion of
17 these larger batteries as these market sectors mature.
18 Sec. 21. For purposes of the Environmental Stewardship of Batteries
19 Act, unless the context otherwise requires:
20 (1) Battery-containing product means a product that contains or is
21 packaged with rechargeable or primary batteries that are covered
22 batteries;
23 (2) Battery management hierarchy means a management system of
24 covered batteries prioritized in descending order as follows:
25 (a) Waste prevention and reduction;
26 (b) Reuse, when reuse is appropriate;
27 (c) Recycling; and
28 (d) Other means of end-of-life management, which may only be
29 utilized after demonstrating to the department that it is not feasible to
30 manage the batteries under the higher priority options in subdivisions
31 (2)(a) through (c) of this section;
-10-

LB607 LB607
2025 2025
1 (3) Battery stewardship organization means a producer that directly
2 implements a battery stewardship plan required under the Environmental
3 Stewardship of Batteries Act or a nonprofit organization designated by a
4 producer or group of producers to implement a battery stewardship plan
5 required under the act;
6 (4) Collection rate means a percentage, by weight, that a battery
7 stewardship organization collects that is calculated by dividing the
8 total weight of primary and rechargeable batteries collected during the
9 previous calendar year by the average annual weight of primary and
10 rechargeable batteries that were estimated to have been sold in the state
11 by all producers participating in an approved battery stewardship plan
12 during the previous three calendar years;
13 (5)(a) Covered battery means a portable battery or, beginning
