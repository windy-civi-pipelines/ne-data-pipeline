examine the process for and feasibility of the State of Nebraska assuming the
administration of the seventy-six mile stretch of the Niobrara River that has
been designated as a national scenic river. Since its designation in 1991, the
Niobrara National Scenic River has been administered by the National Park
Service. Unlike many national park sites, the National Park Service owns very
little of the land along the Niobrara. Management of the river, including
natural features and recreation, is primarily through partnerships with and
facilitation of landowner stewardship efforts.
The interim study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Administration of national scenic rivers by other states;
(2) The process needed to transfer the administration of the Niobrara
National Scenic River from the National Park Service to the State of Nebraska;
(3) Rules and regulations in place or necessary to protect or administer
the Niobrara River;
(4) The current status of the water supply of the basin to determine
whether the water will remain at a level necessary to support the needs of the
users, including any studies, management plans, or water rights obtained that
impact river flow; and
(5) The role of state departments, the Game and Parks Commission, Cherry,
Keya Paha, Brown, and Rock counties, the Niobrara Council, and the affected
natural resources districts in the future administration of the Niobrara River.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Natural Resources Committee of the Legislature shall be
