1 Section 1. Section 77-202, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 77-202 (1) The following property shall be exempt from property
4 taxes:
5 (a) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions to the
6 extent used or being developed for use by the state or governmental
7 subdivision for a public purpose. For purposes of this subdivision:
8 (i) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions means
9 (A) property held in fee title by the state or a governmental subdivision
10 or (B) property beneficially owned by the state or a governmental
11 subdivision in that it is used for a public purpose and is being acquired
12 under a lease-purchase agreement, financing lease, or other instrument
13 which provides for transfer of legal title to the property to the state
14 or a governmental subdivision upon payment of all amounts due thereunder.
15 If the property to be beneficially owned by a governmental subdivision
16 has a total acquisition cost that exceeds the threshold amount or will be
17 used as the site of a public building with a total estimated construction
18 cost that exceeds the threshold amount, then such property shall qualify
19 for an exemption under this section only if the question of acquiring
20 such property or constructing such public building has been submitted at
21 a primary, general, or special election held within the governmental
22 subdivision and has been approved by the voters of the governmental
23 subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, threshold amount means the
24 greater of fifty thousand dollars or six-tenths of one percent of the
25 total actual value of real and personal property of the governmental
26 subdivision that will beneficially own the property as of the end of the
27 governmental subdivision's prior fiscal year; and
28 (ii) Public purpose means use of the property (A) to provide public
29 services with or without cost to the recipient, including the general

1 developments by a public housing authority, parks, culture, recreation,
2 community development, and cemetery purposes, or (B) to carry out the
3 duties and responsibilities conferred by law with or without
4 consideration. Public purpose does not include leasing of property to a
5 private party unless the lease of the property is at fair market value
6 for a public purpose. Leases of property by a public housing authority to
7 low-income individuals as a place of residence are for the authority's
8 public purpose;
9 (b) Unleased property of the state or its governmental subdivisions
10 which is not being used or developed for use for a public purpose but
11 upon which a payment in lieu of taxes is paid for public safety, rescue,
12 and emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
13 services to all governmental units providing such services to the
14 property. Except as provided in Article VIII, section 11, of the
15 Constitution of Nebraska, the payment in lieu of taxes shall be based on
16 the proportionate share of the cost of providing public safety, rescue,
17 or emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
18 services unless a general policy is adopted by the governing body of the
19 governmental subdivision providing such services which provides for a
20 different method of determining the amount of the payment in lieu of
21 taxes. The governing body may adopt a general policy by ordinance or
22 resolution for determining the amount of payment in lieu of taxes by
23 majority vote after a hearing on the ordinance or resolution. Such
24 ordinance or resolution shall nevertheless result in an equitable
25 contribution for the cost of providing such services to the exempt
26 property;
27 (c) Property owned by and used exclusively for agricultural and
28 horticultural societies;
29 (d)(i) Property owned by educational, religious, charitable, or
30 cemetery organizations, or any organization for the exclusive benefit of

-8-
LB200 LB200
2025 2025
1 by the market value of all commercial and industrial personal property in
2 the state;
3 (b) The ratio of the taxable value of all commercial and industrial
4 real property in the state actually subjected to property tax divided by
5 the market value of all commercial and industrial real property in the
6 state;
7 (c) The ratio of the taxable value of railroad personal property to
8 the market value of railroad personal property. The numerator of the
9 ratio shall be the taxable value of railroad personal property. The
10 denominator of the ratio shall be the railroad system value allocated to
11 Nebraska and multiplied by a factor representing the net book value of
12 rail transportation personal property divided by the net book value of
13 total rail transportation property;
14 (d) The ratio of the taxable value of railroad real property to the
15 market value of railroad real property. The numerator of the ratio shall
16 be the taxable value of railroad real property. The denominator of the
17 ratio shall be the railroad system value allocated to Nebraska and
18 multiplied by a factor representing the net book value of rail
19 transportation real property divided by the net book value of total rail
20 transportation property; and
21 (e) Similar calculations shall be made for car line taxable
22 properties.
23 (2) If the ratio of the taxable value of railroad and car line
24 personal or real property exceeds the ratio of the comparable taxable
25 commercial and industrial property by more than five percent, the
26 Property Tax Administrator may adjust the value of such railroad and car
27 line property to the percentage of the comparable taxable commercial and
28 industrial property pursuant to federal statute or Nebraska federal court
29 decisions applicable thereto.
30 (3) For purposes of this section, commercial and industrial property
31 shall mean all real and personal property which is devoted to commercial
-9-
LB200 LB200
2025 2025
1 or industrial use other than rail transportation property and land used
2 primarily for agricultural purposes.
3 (4) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, after the
4 adjustment made pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the
5 Property Tax Administrator shall multiply the value of the tangible
6 personal property of each railroad and car line by the compensating
7 exemption factor calculated in section 77-1238.
8 Sec. 3. Section 77-801, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
9 2024, is amended to read:
10 77-801 (1) All public service entities shall, on or before April 15
11 of each year, furnish a statement specifying such information as may be
12 required by the Property Tax Administrator on forms prescribed by the Tax
13 Commissioner to determine and distribute the entity's total taxable value
14 including the franchise value. All information reported by the public
15 service entities, not available from any other public source, and any
16 memorandum thereof shall be confidential and available to taxing
17 officials only. For good cause shown, the Property Tax Administrator may
18 allow an extension of time in which to file such statement. Such
19 extension shall not exceed fifteen days after April 15.
20 (2) The returns of public service entities shall not be held to be
21 conclusive as to the taxable value of the property, but the Property Tax
22 Administrator shall, from all the information which he or she is able to
23 obtain, find the taxable value of all such property, including tangible
24 property and franchises, and shall assess such property on the same basis
25 as other property is required to be assessed.
26 (3) The county assessor shall assess all nonoperating property of
27 any public service entity. A public service entity operating within the
28 State of Nebraska shall, on or before January 1 of each year, report to
29 the county assessor of each county in which it has situs all nonoperating
30 property belonging to such entity which is not subject to assessment and

2025 2025
1 (4) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, the Property
2 Tax Administrator shall multiply the value of the tangible personal
3 property of each public service entity by the compensating exemption
4 factor calculated in section 77-1238.
5 Sec. 4. Section 77-1238, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
6 2024, is amended to read:
7 77-1238 (1) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, every
8 person who is required to list his or her taxable tangible personal
9 property as defined in section 77-105, as required under section 77-1229,
10 shall receive an exemption from taxation for the first ten thousand
11 dollars of valuation of his or her tangible personal property in each tax
12 district as defined in section 77-127 in which a personal property return
13 is required to be filed. Failure to report tangible personal property on
14 the personal property return required by section 77-1229 shall result in
15 a forfeiture of the exemption for any tangible personal property not
16 timely reported for that year.
17 (2) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, the Property
18 Tax Administrator shall reduce the value of the tangible personal
19 property owned by each railroad, car line company, public service entity,
20 and air carrier by a compensating exemption factor to reflect the
21 exemption allowed in subsection (1) of this section for all other
22 personal property taxpayers. The compensating exemption factor is
23 calculated by multiplying the value of the tangible personal property of
24 the railroad, car line company, public service entity, or air carrier by
25 a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of locally
26 assessed tangible personal property that is actually subjected to
27 property tax after the exemption allowed in subsection (1) of this
28 section, and the denominator of which is the net book value of locally
29 assessed tangible personal property prior to the exemptions allowed in
30 subsection (1) of this section.

9 subdivisions within his or her county from taxes levied and assessed in
10 that year because of the personal property tax exemptions allowed in
11 subsection (1) of section 77-1238. The county assessor and county

16 Services of the amount so certified to be reimbursed by the state.
17 Reimbursement of the tax revenue lost shall be made to each county
18 according to the certification and shall be distributed in two
19 approximately equal installments on the last business day of February and
20 the last business day of June. The State Treasurer shall, on the business
21 day preceding the last business day of February and the last business day

2 be as provided in this subsection. The Property Tax Administrator shall
3 establish the average tax rate that will be used for purposes of
4 reimbursing taxing subdivisions pursuant to this subsection. The average
5 tax rate shall be equal to the total property taxes levied in the state
6 divided by the total taxable value of all taxable property in the state
7 as certified pursuant to section 77-1613.01. The total valuation that
8 will be lost to all taxing subdivisions within each county because of the
9 compensating exemption factor in subsection (2) of section 77-1238,

11 subsection, shall be the tax revenue to be reimbursed to the taxing
12 subdivisions by the state. Reimbursement of the tax revenue lost for

15 industrial depreciable tangible personal property by more than five

2025 2025
1 Section 1. Section 77-202, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 77-202 (1) The following property shall be exempt from property
4 taxes:
5 (a) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions to the
6 extent used or being developed for use by the state or governmental
7 subdivision for a public purpose. For purposes of this subdivision:
8 (i) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions means
9 (A) property held in fee title by the state or a governmental subdivision
10 or (B) property beneficially owned by the state or a governmental
11 subdivision in that it is used for a public purpose and is being acquired
12 under a lease-purchase agreement, financing lease, or other instrument
13 which provides for transfer of legal title to the property to the state
14 or a governmental subdivision upon payment of all amounts due thereunder.
15 If the property to be beneficially owned by a governmental subdivision
16 has a total acquisition cost that exceeds the threshold amount or will be
17 used as the site of a public building with a total estimated construction
18 cost that exceeds the threshold amount, then such property shall qualify
19 for an exemption under this section only if the question of acquiring
20 such property or constructing such public building has been submitted at
21 a primary, general, or special election held within the governmental
22 subdivision and has been approved by the voters of the governmental
23 subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, threshold amount means the
24 greater of fifty thousand dollars or six-tenths of one percent of the
25 total actual value of real and personal property of the governmental
26 subdivision that will beneficially own the property as of the end of the
27 governmental subdivision's prior fiscal year; and
28 (ii) Public purpose means use of the property (A) to provide public
29 services with or without cost to the recipient, including the general
30 operation of government, public education, public safety, transportation,
31 public works, civil and criminal justice, public health and welfare,
-2-

LB200 LB200
2025 2025
1 developments by a public housing authority, parks, culture, recreation,
2 community development, and cemetery purposes, or (B) to carry out the
3 duties and responsibilities conferred by law with or without
4 consideration. Public purpose does not include leasing of property to a
5 private party unless the lease of the property is at fair market value
6 for a public purpose. Leases of property by a public housing authority to
7 low-income individuals as a place of residence are for the authority's
8 public purpose;
9 (b) Unleased property of the state or its governmental subdivisions
10 which is not being used or developed for use for a public purpose but
11 upon which a payment in lieu of taxes is paid for public safety, rescue,
12 and emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
13 services to all governmental units providing such services to the
14 property. Except as provided in Article VIII, section 11, of the
15 Constitution of Nebraska, the payment in lieu of taxes shall be based on
16 the proportionate share of the cost of providing public safety, rescue,
17 or emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
18 services unless a general policy is adopted by the governing body of the
19 governmental subdivision providing such services which provides for a
20 different method of determining the amount of the payment in lieu of
21 taxes. The governing body may adopt a general policy by ordinance or
22 resolution for determining the amount of payment in lieu of taxes by
23 majority vote after a hearing on the ordinance or resolution. Such
24 ordinance or resolution shall nevertheless result in an equitable
25 contribution for the cost of providing such services to the exempt
26 property;
27 (c) Property owned by and used exclusively for agricultural and
28 horticultural societies;
29 (d)(i) Property owned by educational, religious, charitable, or
30 cemetery organizations, or any organization for the exclusive benefit of
31 any such educational, religious, charitable, or cemetery organization,
-3-

2025 2025
1 and used exclusively for educational, religious, charitable, or cemetery
2 purposes, when such property is not (A) owned or used for financial gain
3 or profit to either the owner or user, (B) used for the sale of alcoholic
4 liquors for more than twenty hours per week, or (C) owned or used by an

23 section 71-429, nursing facility as defined in section 71-424, or

25 housing for medicaid beneficiaries, except that the exemption amount for
26 such property shall be a percentage of the property taxes that would
27 otherwise be due. Such percentage shall be equal to the average
28 percentage of occupied beds in the facility provided to medicaid
29 beneficiaries over the most recent three-year period.
30 (iv) The property tax exemption authorized in subdivision (1)(d)(i)
31 of this section shall apply to a building that (A) is owned by a

7 financial gain or profit to either the owner or user.
8 (2) The increased value of land by reason of shade and ornamental
9 trees planted along the highway shall not be taken into account in the

22 or rented thirty days or less and may be returned at the option of the
23 lessee or renter at any time and the personal property is of a type which
24 would be considered household goods or personal effects if owned by an
25 individual. All other personal property owned for purposes of leasing or
26 renting such property to others for financial gain shall not be
27 considered business inventory.
28 (6) Any personal property exempt pursuant to subsection (2) of
29 section 77-4105 or section 77-5209.02 shall be exempt from the personal
30 property tax.

23 form or that of an assembled product, for the purpose of subsequent use
24 at a physical location outside this state by the person operating a data

26 77-693 (1) The Property Tax Administrator in determining the taxable
27 value of railroads and car lines shall determine the following ratios
28 involving railroad and car line property and commercial and industrial
29 property:
30 (a) The ratio of the taxable value of all commercial and industrial

-8-

LB200 LB200
2025 2025
1 by the market value of all commercial and industrial personal property in
2 the state;
3 (b) The ratio of the taxable value of all commercial and industrial
4 real property in the state actually subjected to property tax divided by
5 the market value of all commercial and industrial real property in the
6 state;
7 (c) The ratio of the taxable value of railroad personal property to
8 the market value of railroad personal property. The numerator of the
9 ratio shall be the taxable value of railroad personal property. The
10 denominator of the ratio shall be the railroad system value allocated to
11 Nebraska and multiplied by a factor representing the net book value of
12 rail transportation personal property divided by the net book value of
13 total rail transportation property;
14 (d) The ratio of the taxable value of railroad real property to the
15 market value of railroad real property. The numerator of the ratio shall
16 be the taxable value of railroad real property. The denominator of the
17 ratio shall be the railroad system value allocated to Nebraska and
18 multiplied by a factor representing the net book value of rail
19 transportation real property divided by the net book value of total rail
20 transportation property; and
21 (e) Similar calculations shall be made for car line taxable
22 properties.
23 (2) If the ratio of the taxable value of railroad and car line
24 personal or real property exceeds the ratio of the comparable taxable
25 commercial and industrial property by more than five percent, the
26 Property Tax Administrator may adjust the value of such railroad and car
27 line property to the percentage of the comparable taxable commercial and
28 industrial property pursuant to federal statute or Nebraska federal court
29 decisions applicable thereto.
30 (3) For purposes of this section, commercial and industrial property
31 shall mean all real and personal property which is devoted to commercial
-9-

LB200 LB200
2025 2025
1 or industrial use other than rail transportation property and land used
2 primarily for agricultural purposes.
3 (4) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, after the
4 adjustment made pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the
5 Property Tax Administrator shall multiply the value of the tangible
6 personal property of each railroad and car line by the compensating
7 exemption factor calculated in section 77-1238.
8 Sec. 3. Section 77-801, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
9 2024, is amended to read:
10 77-801 (1) All public service entities shall, on or before April 15
11 of each year, furnish a statement specifying such information as may be
12 required by the Property Tax Administrator on forms prescribed by the Tax
13 Commissioner to determine and distribute the entity's total taxable value
14 including the franchise value. All information reported by the public
15 service entities, not available from any other public source, and any
16 memorandum thereof shall be confidential and available to taxing
17 officials only. For good cause shown, the Property Tax Administrator may
18 allow an extension of time in which to file such statement. Such
19 extension shall not exceed fifteen days after April 15.
20 (2) The returns of public service entities shall not be held to be
21 conclusive as to the taxable value of the property, but the Property Tax
22 Administrator shall, from all the information which he or she is able to
23 obtain, find the taxable value of all such property, including tangible
24 property and franchises, and shall assess such property on the same basis
25 as other property is required to be assessed.
26 (3) The county assessor shall assess all nonoperating property of
27 any public service entity. A public service entity operating within the
28 State of Nebraska shall, on or before January 1 of each year, report to
29 the county assessor of each county in which it has situs all nonoperating
30 property belonging to such entity which is not subject to assessment and
31 assessed by the Property Tax Administrator under section 77-802.
-10-

LB200 LB200
2025 2025
1 (4) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, the Property
2 Tax Administrator shall multiply the value of the tangible personal
3 property of each public service entity by the compensating exemption
4 factor calculated in section 77-1238.
5 Sec. 4. Section 77-1238, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
6 2024, is amended to read:
7 77-1238 (1) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, every
8 person who is required to list his or her taxable tangible personal
9 property as defined in section 77-105, as required under section 77-1229,
10 shall receive an exemption from taxation for the first ten thousand
11 dollars of valuation of his or her tangible personal property in each tax
12 district as defined in section 77-127 in which a personal property return
13 is required to be filed. Failure to report tangible personal property on
14 the personal property return required by section 77-1229 shall result in
15 a forfeiture of the exemption for any tangible personal property not
16 timely reported for that year.
17 (2) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, the Property
18 Tax Administrator shall reduce the value of the tangible personal
19 property owned by each railroad, car line company, public service entity,
20 and air carrier by a compensating exemption factor to reflect the
21 exemption allowed in subsection (1) of this section for all other
22 personal property taxpayers. The compensating exemption factor is
23 calculated by multiplying the value of the tangible personal property of
24 the railroad, car line company, public service entity, or air carrier by
25 a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of locally
26 assessed tangible personal property that is actually subjected to
27 property tax after the exemption allowed in subsection (1) of this
28 section, and the denominator of which is the net book value of locally
29 assessed tangible personal property prior to the exemptions allowed in
30 subsection (1) of this section.

1 2024, is amended to read:
2 77-1239 (1) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020,
3 reimbursement to taxing subdivisions for tax revenue that will be lost
4 because of the personal property tax exemptions allowed in subsection (1)
5 of section 77-1238 shall be as provided in this subsection. The county
6 assessor and county treasurer shall, on or before November 30 of each
7 year, certify to the Tax Commissioner, on forms prescribed by the Tax
8 Commissioner, the total tax revenue that will be lost to all taxing
9 subdivisions within his or her county from taxes levied and assessed in
10 that year because of the personal property tax exemptions allowed in
11 subsection (1) of section 77-1238. The county assessor and county
12 treasurer may amend the certification to show any change or correction in
13 the total tax revenue that will be lost until May 30 of the next
14 succeeding year. The Tax Commissioner shall, on or before January 1 next
15 following the certification, notify the Director of Administrative
16 Services of the amount so certified to be reimbursed by the state.
17 Reimbursement of the tax revenue lost shall be made to each county
18 according to the certification and shall be distributed in two
19 approximately equal installments on the last business day of February and
20 the last business day of June. The State Treasurer shall, on the business
21 day preceding the last business day of February and the last business day
22 of June, notify the Director of Administrative Services of the amount of
23 funds available in the General Fund to pay the reimbursement. The
24 Director of Administrative Services shall, on the last business day of
25 February and the last business day of June, draw warrants against funds
26 appropriated. Out of the amount received, the county treasurer shall
27 distribute to each of the taxing subdivisions within his or her county
28 the full tax revenue lost by each subdivision, except that one percent of
29 such amount shall be deposited in the county general fund.
30 (2) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, reimbursement
31 to taxing subdivisions for tax revenue that will be lost because of the
-12-

LB200 LB200
2025 2025
1 compensating exemption factor in subsection (2) of section 77-1238 shall
2 be as provided in this subsection. The Property Tax Administrator shall
3 establish the average tax rate that will be used for purposes of
4 reimbursing taxing subdivisions pursuant to this subsection. The average
5 tax rate shall be equal to the total property taxes levied in the state
6 divided by the total taxable value of all taxable property in the state
7 as certified pursuant to section 77-1613.01. The total valuation that
8 will be lost to all taxing subdivisions within each county because of the
9 compensating exemption factor in subsection (2) of section 77-1238,
10 multiplied by the average tax rate calculated pursuant to this
11 subsection, shall be the tax revenue to be reimbursed to the taxing
12 subdivisions by the state. Reimbursement of the tax revenue lost for
13 public service entities shall be made to each county according to the
14 certification and shall be distributed among the taxing subdivisions
15 within each county in the same proportion as all public service entity
16 taxes levied by the taxing subdivisions. Reimbursement of the tax revenue
17 lost for railroads shall be made to each county according to the
18 certification and shall be distributed among the taxing subdivisions
19 within each county in the same proportion as all railroad taxes levied by
20 taxing subdivisions. Reimbursement of the tax revenue lost for car line
21 companies shall be distributed in the same manner as the taxes collected
22 pursuant to section 77-684. Reimbursement of the tax revenue lost for air
23 carriers shall be distributed in the same manner as the taxes collected
24 pursuant to section 77-1250.
25 (3) Each taxing subdivision shall, in preparing its annual or
26 biennial budget, take into account the amounts to be received under this
27 section.
28 Sec. 6. Section 77-1248, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
29 2024, is amended to read:
30 77-1248 (1) The Property Tax Administrator shall ascertain from the
31 reports made and from any other information obtained by him or her the
-13-

2025 2025
1 taxable value of the flight equipment of air carriers and the proportion
2 allocated to this state for the purposes of taxation as provided in
3 section 77-1245.
4 (2)(a) In determining the taxable value of the flight equipment of
5 air carriers pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the Property Tax
6 Administrator shall determine the following ratios:
7 (i) The ratio of the taxable value of all commercial and industrial
8 depreciable tangible personal property in the state actually subjected to
9 property tax to the market value of all commercial and industrial
10 depreciable tangible personal property in the state; and
11 (ii) The ratio of the taxable value of flight equipment of air
12 carriers to the market value of flight equipment of air carriers.
13 (b) If the ratio of the taxable value of flight equipment of air
14 carriers exceeds the ratio of the taxable value of commercial and
15 industrial depreciable tangible personal property by more than five
16 percent, the Property Tax Administrator may adjust the value of such
17 flight equipment of air carriers to the percentage of the taxable
18 commercial and industrial depreciable tangible personal property pursuant
19 to federal law applicable to air carrier transportation property or
20 Nebraska federal court decisions applicable thereto.
21 (c) For purposes of this subsection, commercial and industrial
22 depreciable tangible personal property means all personal property which
23 is devoted to commercial or industrial use other than flight equipment of
24 air carriers.
25 (3) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, the Property
26 Tax Administrator shall multiply the valuation of each air carrier by the
27 compensating exemption factor calculated in section 77-1238.
28 Sec. 7. Section 77-1514, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
29 2024, is amended to read:
30 77-1514 (1) The county assessor shall prepare an abstract of the

2 county assessor shall file the abstract with the Property Tax
3 Administrator on or before March 19, except beginning January 1, 2014, in
4 any county with a population of at least one hundred fifty thousand
5 inhabitants according to the most recent federal decennial census, the
6 real property abstract shall be filed on or before March 25. The abstract
7 shall show the taxable value of real property in the county as determined
8 by the county assessor and any other information as required by the
9 Property Tax Administrator. The Property Tax Administrator, upon written
10 request from the county assessor, may for good cause shown extend the
11 final filing due date for the abstract and the statutory deadlines
12 provided in section 77-5027. The Property Tax Administrator may extend
13 the statutory deadline in section 77-5028 for a county if the deadline is
14 extended for that county. Beginning January 1, 2014, in any county with a
15 population of at least one hundred fifty thousand inhabitants according
16 to the most recent federal decennial census, the county assessor shall
17 request an extension of the final filing due date by March 22.
18 (2) For tax years after prior to tax year 2024 2020, the county
19 assessor shall prepare an abstract of the property assessment rolls of
20 locally assessed personal property of his or her county on forms
21 prescribed and furnished by the Tax Commissioner. The county assessor
22 shall electronically file the abstract with the Property Tax
23 Administrator on or before July 20.
24 Sec. 8. Original sections 77-202, 77-693, 77-801, 77-1238, 77-1239,
25 77-1248, and 77-1514, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are
26 repealed.
