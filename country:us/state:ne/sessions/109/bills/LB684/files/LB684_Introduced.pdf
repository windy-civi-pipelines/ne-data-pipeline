8 (b) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(c) of this section, there
9 shall be a presumption that a veteran eligible under section 29-4802

11 presumption shall only be overcome by a judicial finding, based on an
12 individualized assessment of the veteran and consideration of the factors
13 set forth in subdivisions (4)(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section,
14 that entry of judgment of conviction should not be deferred. The fact
15 that a veteran has previously absconded from or violated pretrial
16 release, probation, parole, supervised release, post-release supervision,
17 or another form of court-ordered supervision, including a violation
18 arising from commission of a new offense or an offense committed while
19 previously participating in a veteran justice program, is not, standing
20 alone, a sufficient basis to overcome the presumption.
21 (c) The presumption provided for in subdivision (4)(b) of this
22 section does not apply to a veteran charged with:
23 (i) A violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, or a city or
24 village ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or
25 60-6,197, following a previous conviction for a violation of any such
26 section or ordinance; or
27 (ii) An offense that resulted in serious bodily injury to another
28 person.
29 (5) Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections
30 29-2293 and 29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant
31 to a deferred judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation

2 (6) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an
3 opportunity to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated
4 a condition of his or her probation, the court may enter any order
5 authorized by section 29-2268 or pronounce judgment and impose such new
6 sentence as might have been originally imposed for the offense for which
7 the defendant was convicted.
8 (7) Upon satisfactory completion of the conditions of probation and
9 the payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed
10 under section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to
11 withdraw any plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action
12 without entry of judgment. The court shall not grant such motion until a
13 victim of the offense has received notice and the opportunity to be
14 heard, as required by subsection (4) of section 29-4804.
15 (8) Sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 apply to offenses committed on or
16 after July 1, 2025. For purposes of this subsection, an offense shall be
17 deemed to have been committed prior to July 1, 2025, if any element of
18 the offense occurred prior to such date.

23 responsibility for his or her actions and the victim is able to address
24 the offender and request an apology and restitution, with the goal of
25 creating an agreed-upon written plan;
26 (d) Prehearing conference means a facilitated meeting prior to
27 appearing in court and held to gain the cooperation of the parties, to

2 (A) All levels of probation supervision have been exhausted;
3 (B) All options for community-based services have been exhausted;
4 and
5 (C) Placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center is a
6 matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the
7 juvenile or the person or property of another or if it appears that such
8 juvenile is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court;
9 (c) After the hearing, the court may, as a condition of an order of
10 intensive supervised probation, commit such juvenile to the Office of
11 Juvenile Services for placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment
12 center operated in compliance with state law. Upon commitment by the
13 court to the Office of Juvenile Services, the court shall immediately
14 notify the Office of Juvenile Services of the commitment. Intensive
15 supervised probation for purposes of this subdivision means that the
16 Office of Juvenile Services shall be responsible for the care and custody
17 of the juvenile until the Office of Juvenile Services discharges the
18 juvenile from commitment to the Office of Juvenile Services. Upon
19 discharge of the juvenile, the court shall hold a review hearing on the
20 conditions of probation and enter any order allowed under subdivision (1)
21 (a) of this section;
22 (d) The Office of Juvenile Services shall notify those required to
23 be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267, all interested parties, and the
24 committing court of the pending discharge of a juvenile from the youth
25 rehabilitation and treatment center sixty days prior to discharge and
26 again in every case not less than thirty days prior to discharge. Upon
27 notice of pending discharge by the Office of Juvenile Services, the court
28 shall set a continued disposition hearing in anticipation of reentry. The
29 Office of Juvenile Services shall work in collaboration with the Juvenile
30 Probation Agency Office of Probation Administration in developing an
31 individualized reentry plan for the juvenile as provided in section
-44-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 43-425. The Office of Juvenile Services shall provide a copy of the
2 individualized reentry plan to the juvenile, the juvenile's attorney, and
3 the county attorney or city attorney prior to the continued disposition
4 hearing. At the continued disposition hearing, the court shall review and
5 approve or modify the individualized reentry plan, place the juvenile
6 under probation supervision, and enter any other order allowed by law. No
7 hearing is required if all interested parties stipulate to the
8 individualized reentry plan by signed motion. In such a case, the court
9 shall approve the conditions of probation, approve the individualized
10 reentry plan, and place the juvenile under probation supervision; and
11 (e) The Office of Juvenile Services is responsible for
12 transportation of the juvenile to and from the youth rehabilitation and
13 treatment center. The Office of Juvenile Services may contract for such
14 services. A plan for a juvenile's transport to return to the community
15 shall be a part of the individualized reentry plan. The Office of
16 Juvenile Services may approve family to provide such transport when
17 specified in the individualized reentry plan.
18 (2) When any juvenile is found by the court to be a juvenile
19 described in subdivision (3)(b) of section 43-247, the court may enter
20 such order as it is empowered to enter under subdivision (1)(a) of this
21 section.
22 (3) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile described in
23 subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247, the court may
24 order the juvenile to be assessed for referral to participate in a
25 restorative justice program. Factors that the judge may consider for such
26 referral include, but are not limited to: The juvenile's age,
27 intellectual capacity, and living environment; the ages of others who
28 were part of the offense; the age and capacity of the victim; and the
29 nature of the case.
30 (4) When a juvenile is placed on probation and a probation officer
31 has reasonable cause to believe that such juvenile has committed a
-45-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 violation of a condition of his or her probation, the probation officer
2 shall take appropriate measures as provided in section 43-286.01.
3 (5)(a) When a juvenile is placed on probation or under the
4 supervision of the court and it is alleged that the juvenile is again a
5 juvenile described in subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section
6 43-247, a petition may be filed and the same procedure followed and
7 rights given at a hearing on the original petition. If an adjudication is
8 made that the allegations of the petition are true, the court may make
9 any disposition authorized by this section for such adjudications and the
10 county attorney may file a motion to revoke the juvenile's probation.
11 (b) When a juvenile is placed on probation or under the supervision
12 of the court for conduct under subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of
13 section 43-247 and it is alleged that the juvenile has violated a term of
14 probation or supervision or that the juvenile has violated an order of
15 the court, a motion to revoke probation or supervision or to change the
16 disposition may be filed and proceedings held as follows:
17 (i) The motion shall set forth specific factual allegations of the
18 alleged violations and a copy of such motion shall be served on all
19 persons required to be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267;
20 (ii) The juvenile shall be entitled to a hearing before the court to
21 determine the validity of the allegations. At such hearing the juvenile
22 shall be entitled to those rights relating to counsel provided by section
23 43-272 and those rights relating to detention provided by sections 43-254
24 to 43-256. The juvenile shall also be entitled to speak and present
25 documents, witnesses, or other evidence on his or her own behalf. He or
26 she may confront persons who have given adverse information concerning
27 the alleged violations, may cross-examine such persons, and may show that
28 he or she did not violate the conditions of his or her probation or
29 supervision or an order of the court or, if he or she did, that
30 mitigating circumstances suggest that the violation does not warrant
31 revocation of probation or supervision or a change of disposition. The
-46-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the juvenile is
2 taken into custody;
3 (iii) The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and shall
4 be flexible enough to consider evidence, including letters, affidavits,
5 and other material, that would not be admissible in an adversarial
6 criminal trial;
7 (iv) The juvenile shall not be confined, detained, or otherwise
8 significantly deprived of his or her liberty pursuant to the filing of a
9 motion described in this section unless the requirements of subdivision
10 (5) of section 43-251.01 and section 43-260.01 have been met. In all
11 cases when the requirements of subdivision (5) of section 43-251.01 and
12 section 43-260.01 have been met and the juvenile is confined, detained,
13 or otherwise significantly deprived of his or her liberty as a result of
14 his or her alleged violation of probation, supervision, or a court order,
15 the juvenile shall be given a preliminary hearing. If, as a result of
16 such preliminary hearing, probable cause is found to exist, the juvenile
17 shall be entitled to a hearing before the court in accordance with this
18 subsection;
19 (v) If the juvenile is found by the court to have violated the terms
20 of his or her probation or supervision or an order of the court, the
21 court may modify the terms and conditions of the probation, supervision,
22 or other court order, extend the period of probation, supervision, or
23 other court order, or enter any order of disposition that could have been
24 made at the time the original order was entered; and
25 (vi) In cases when the court revokes probation, supervision, or
26 other court order, it shall enter a written statement as to the evidence
27 relied on and the reasons for revocation.
28 (6)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (6)(b) of this section, the
29 court shall not change a disposition unless the court finds that the
30 juvenile has violated a term or condition of probation or supervision or
31 an order of the court and the procedures in subdivision (5)(b) of this
-47-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 section have been satisfied.
2 (b) Upon motion of the juvenile, the court may modify the terms or
3 conditions of probation or supervision or modify a dispositional order
4 if:
5 (i) All parties stipulate to the particular modification; and
6 (ii) The juvenile has consulted with counsel or has waived counsel.
7 Any waiver must be particular to the modification and shall comply with
8 section 43-3102.
9 (7) Costs incurred on behalf of a juvenile under this section shall
10 be paid as provided in section 43-290.01.
11 (8) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile described in
12 subdivision (4) of section 43-247, the juvenile court shall within thirty
13 days of adjudication transmit to the Director of Motor Vehicles an
14 abstract of the court record of adjudication.
15 Sec. 46. Section 43-286.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
16 2024, is amended to read:
17 43-286.01 (1) For purposes of this section, graduated response means
18 an accountability-based series of sanctions, incentives, and services
19 designed to facilitate the juvenile’s continued progress in changing
20 behavior, ongoing compliance, and successful completion of probation.
21 Graduated response does not include restrictions of liberty that would
22 otherwise require a hearing under subsection (3) of section 43-253.
23 (2) The Juvenile Probation Agency Office of Probation Administration
24 may establish a statewide standardized graduated response matrix of
25 incentives for compliance and positive behaviors and sanctions for
26 probationers who violate the terms and conditions of a court order. The
27 graduated response system shall use recognized best practices and be
28 developed with the input of stakeholders, including judges, probation
29 officers, county attorneys, defense attorneys, juveniles, and parents.
30 The agency office shall provide implementation and ongoing training to
31 all probation officers on the graduated response options.
-48-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 (3) Graduated response sanctions should be immediate, certain,
2 consistent, and fair to appropriately address the behavior. Failure to
3 complete a sanction may result in repeating the sanction, increasing the
4 duration, or selecting a different sanction similar in nature. Continued
5 failure to comply could result in a request for a motion to revoke
6 probation. Once a sanction is successfully completed the alleged
7 probation violation is deemed resolved and cannot be alleged as a
8 violation in future proceedings.
9 (4) Graduated response incentives should provide positive
10 reinforcement to encourage and support positive behavior change and
11 compliance with court-ordered conditions of probation.
12 (5) Whenever a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe
13 that a juvenile subject to the supervision of a probation officer has
14 committed a violation of the terms of the juvenile's probation while on
15 probation, but that such juvenile will not attempt to leave the
16 jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in danger, the
17 probation officer shall either:
18 (a) Impose one or more graduated response sanctions with the
19 approval of his or her chief probation officer or such chief's designee.
20 The decision to impose graduated response sanctions in lieu of formal
21 revocation proceedings rests with the probation officer and his or her
22 chief probation officer or such chief's designee and shall be based upon
23 such juvenile's risk level, the severity of the violation, and the
24 juvenile's response to the violation. If graduated response sanctions are
25 to be imposed, such juvenile shall acknowledge in writing the nature of
26 the violation and agree upon the graduated response sanction with
27 approval of such juvenile's parents or guardian. Such juvenile has the
28 right to decline to acknowledge the violation, and if he or she declines
29 to acknowledge the violation, the probation officer shall submit a
30 written report pursuant to subdivision (5)(b) of this section. If the
31 juvenile fails to satisfy the graduated response sanctions and the
-49-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 officer office determines that a motion to revoke probation should be
2 pursued, the probation officer shall submit a written report pursuant to
3 subdivision (5)(b) of this section. A copy of the report shall be
4 submitted to the county attorney of the county where probation was
5 imposed; or
6 (b) Submit a written report to the county attorney of the county
7 where probation was imposed and to the juvenile’s attorney of record,
8 outlining the nature of the probation violation and request that formal
9 revocation proceedings be instituted against the juvenile subject to the
10 supervision of a probation officer. The report shall also include a
11 statement regarding why graduated response sanctions were not utilized or
12 were ineffective. If there is no attorney of record for the juvenile, the
13 officer office shall notify the court and counsel for the juvenile shall
14 be appointed.
15 (6) Whenever a probation officer has reasonable cause to believe
16 that a juvenile subject to the supervision of a probation officer has
17 violated a condition of his or her probation and that such juvenile will
18 attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place lives or property in
19 danger, the probation officer shall take such juvenile into temporary
20 custody without a warrant and may call on any peace officer for
21 assistance as provided in section 43-248. Continued detention or
22 deprivation of liberty shall be subject to the criteria and requirements
23 of sections 43-251.01, 43-260, and 43-260.01 and subdivision (5)(b)(iv)
24 of section 43-286, and a hearing shall be held before the court within
25 twenty-four hours as provided in subsection (3) of section 43-253.
26 (7) Immediately after detention or deprivation of liberty pursuant
27 to subsection (6) of this section, the probation officer shall notify the
28 county attorney of the county where probation was imposed and the
29 juvenile's attorney of record and submit a written report describing the
30 risk of harm to lives or property or of fleeing the jurisdiction which
31 precipitated the need for such detention or deprivation of liberty and of
-50-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 any violation of probation. If there is no attorney of record for the
2 juvenile, the officer office shall notify the court and counsel for the
3 juvenile shall be appointed. After prompt consideration of the written
4 report, the county attorney shall:
5 (a) Order the release of the juvenile from confinement or
6 alternative to detention subject to the supervision of a probation
7 officer; or
8 (b) File with the adjudicating court a motion to revoke the
9 probation.
10 (8) Whenever a county attorney receives a report from a probation
11 officer that a juvenile subject to the supervision of a probation officer
12 has violated a condition of probation and the probation officer is
13 seeking revocation of probation, the county attorney may file a motion to
14 revoke probation.
15 (9) Whenever a juvenile subject to supervision of a probation
16 officer is engaging in positive behavior, completion of goals, and
17 compliance with the terms of probation, the probation officer shall use
18 graduated incentives to provide positive reinforcement and encouragement
19 of such behavior. The Juvenile Probation Agency office shall keep records
20 of all incentives and provide such records to the county attorney or the
21 juvenile’s attorney upon request.
22 (10) During the term of probation, the court, on application of a
23 probation officer or of the juvenile or on its own motion, may reduce or
24 eliminate any of the conditions imposed on the juvenile. Upon completion
25 of the term of probation or the earlier discharge of the juvenile, the
26 juvenile shall be relieved of any obligations imposed by the order of the
27 court and his or her record shall be sealed pursuant to section
28 43-2,108.04.
29 (11) The Juvenile Probation Administrator probation administrator
30 shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to carry out this
31 section.

7 disposition under section 43-284: Upon a determination by the court that

10 a reasonable sum for the care, custody, education, and maintenance of the
11 juvenile to be paid out of a fund appropriated annually by the county
12 where the petition is filed until suitable provisions are made for the
13 juvenile without such payment. The amount to be paid by a county for
14 education shall not exceed the average cost for education of a public
15 school student in the county in which the juvenile is placed and shall be
16 paid only for education in kindergarten through grade twelve; and
17 (c) Other costs shall be as provided in section 43-290.

24 officer, the Juvenile Probation Agency Office of Probation Administration
25 is deemed to have placement and care responsibility for the juvenile.
26 (2) The court shall order the initial placement and level of care
27 for the juvenile placed on juvenile probation. Prior to determining the
28 placement and level of care for a juvenile, the court may solicit a
29 recommendation from the Juvenile Probation Agency Office of Probation

31 reviewed periodically, but not less than once every six months by the
-53-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 court in person, by video, or telephonically. Periodic reviews shall
2 assess the juvenile's safety and the continued necessity and

7 copy of any report filed with the court by the agency office pursuant to
8 this subsection.
9 (3) The Juvenile Probation Agency Office of Probation Administration

13 agency office shall file a notice of placement change with the court and
14 shall send copies of the notice to all interested parties at least seven
15 days before the change of placement. The court, on its own motion, or
16 upon the filing of an objection to the change by an interested party, may

13 Sec. 61. Section 43-2404.02, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
14 2024, is amended to read:
15 43-2404.02 (1) There is created a separate and distinct budgetary
16 program within the commission to be known as the Community-based Juvenile
17 Services Aid Program. Funding acquired from participation in the federal
18 act, state General Funds, and funding acquired from other sources which
19 may be used for purposes consistent with the Juvenile Services Act and
20 the federal act shall be used to aid in the establishment and provision
21 of community-based services for juveniles who come in contact with the
22 juvenile justice system.
23 (2)(a) Ten percent of the annual General Fund appropriation to the
24 Community-based Juvenile Services Aid Program, excluding administrative
25 budget funds, shall be set aside for the development of a common data set
26 and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Community-based Juvenile
27 Services Aid Program. The intent in creating this common data set is to
28 allow for evaluation of the use of the funds and the effectiveness of the
29 programs or outcomes in the Community-based Juvenile Services Aid
30 Program.
31 (b) The common data set shall be developed and maintained by the
-87-

LB684 LB684
2025 2025
1 commission and shall serve as a primary data collection site for any
2 intervention funded by the Community-based Juvenile Services Aid Program
3 designed to serve juveniles and deter involvement in the formal juvenile
4 justice system. The commission shall work with agencies and programs to
5 enhance existing data sets. To ensure that the data set permits
6 evaluation of recidivism and other measures, the commission shall work
7 with the Juvenile Probation Agency Office of Probation Administration,
8 juvenile diversion programs, law enforcement, the courts, and others to
9 compile data that demonstrates whether a youth has moved deeper into the
10 juvenile justice system. The University of Nebraska at Omaha, Juvenile
11 Justice Institute, shall assist with the development of common
12 definitions, variables, and training required for data collection and
13 reporting into the common data set by juvenile justice programs. The
14 common data set maintained by the commission shall be provided to the
15 University of Nebraska at Omaha, Juvenile Justice Institute, to assess
16 the effectiveness of the Community-based Juvenile Services Aid Program.
17 (c) Providing the commission access to records and information for,
18 as well as the commission granting access to records and information
19 from, the common data set is not a violation of confidentiality
20 provisions under any law, rule, or regulation if done in good faith for
21 purposes of evaluation. Records and documents, regardless of physical
22 form, that are obtained or produced or presented to the commission for
23 the common data set are not public records for purposes of sections
24 84-712 to 84-712.09.
25 (d) The ten percent of the annual General Fund appropriation to the
26 Community-based Juvenile Services Aid Program, excluding administrative
27 budget funds, shall be appropriated as follows: In fiscal year 2015-16,
28 seven percent shall go to the commission for development of the common
29 data set and three percent shall go to the University of Nebraska at
30 Omaha, Juvenile Justice Institute, for evaluation. In fiscal year
31 2016-17, six percent shall go to the commission for development and
-88-

8 (e) The remaining funds in the annual General Fund appropriation to
9 the Community-based Juvenile Services Aid Program shall be apportioned as
10 aid in accordance with a formula established in rules and regulations
11 adopted and promulgated by the commission. The formula shall be based on
12 the total number of residents per county and federally recognized or
13 state-recognized Indian tribe who are twelve years of age through
14 eighteen years of age and other relevant factors as determined by the
15 commission. The commission may require a local match of up to forty
16 percent from the county, multiple counties, federally recognized or
17 state-recognized Indian tribe or tribes, or any combination of the three
18 which is receiving aid under such program. Any local expenditures for
19 community-based programs for juveniles may be applied toward such match
20 requirement.
21 (3)(a) In distributing funds provided under the Community-based
22 Juvenile Services Aid Program, aid recipients shall prioritize programs
23 and services that will divert juveniles from the juvenile justice system,
24 reduce the population of juveniles in juvenile detention and secure
25 confinement, and assist in transitioning juveniles from out-of-home
26 placements.
27 (b) Funds received under the Community-based Juvenile Services Aid
28 Program shall be used exclusively to assist the aid recipient in the
29 implementation and operation of programs or the provision of services
30 identified in the aid recipient's comprehensive juvenile services plan,
