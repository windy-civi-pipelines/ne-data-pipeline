1 with the certifying municipality.

8 (15) In all proceedings under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, the

10 Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner in his or her discretion may waive all or
11 part of any penalties provided by the provisions of such act or interest
12 on delinquent taxes specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from
13 time to time be adjusted.
14 (16)(a) The purpose of this subsection is to set forth the state's
15 policy for the protection of the confidentiality rights of all
16 participants in the system operated pursuant to the streamlined sales and
17 use tax agreement and of the privacy interests of consumers who deal with
18 model 1 sellers.
19 (b) For purposes of this subsection:
20 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
21 person;
22 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
23 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
24 (iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
25 identifies a person.
26 (c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers
27 is to preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
28 With very limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform
29 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
30 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
31 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
-9-
LB270 LB270
2025 2025
1 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only
2 if that certified service provider certifies that:
3 (i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the
4 fundamental precept of anonymity is respected;
5 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
6 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to
7 exempt purchasers;
8 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
9 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
10 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at
11 all, it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information
12 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
13 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
14 service provider;
15 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
16 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
17 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
18 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
19 and
20 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
21 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
22 unauthorized access and disclosure.
23 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
24 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
25 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
26 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
27 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
28 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
29 longer be retained by the member states.
30 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
31 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
-10-
LB270 LB270
2025 2025
1 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
2 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
3 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
4 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
5 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
6 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
7 such request.
8 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
9 General.
10 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
11 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
12 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
13 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:
14 (i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement
15 and state law;
16 (ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information
17 Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
18 (iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
19 taxpayer information;
20 (iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of
21 federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the
22 Internal Revenue Service; and
23 (v) Collect, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise use anonymous data
24 for governmental purposes.
25 Sec. 2. Original section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative
26 Supplement, 2024, is repealed.

12 on delinquent taxes specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from
13 time to time be adjusted.
14 (16)(a) The purpose of this subsection is to set forth the state's
15 policy for the protection of the confidentiality rights of all
16 participants in the system operated pursuant to the streamlined sales and
17 use tax agreement and of the privacy interests of consumers who deal with
18 model 1 sellers.
19 (b) For purposes of this subsection:
20 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
21 person;
22 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
23 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
24 (iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
25 identifies a person.
26 (c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers
27 is to preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
28 With very limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform
29 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
30 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
31 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
-9-

LB270 LB270
2025 2025
1 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only
2 if that certified service provider certifies that:
3 (i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the
4 fundamental precept of anonymity is respected;
5 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
6 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to
7 exempt purchasers;
8 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
9 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
10 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at
11 all, it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information
12 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
13 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
14 service provider;
15 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
16 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
17 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
18 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
19 and
20 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
21 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
22 unauthorized access and disclosure.
23 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
24 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
25 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
26 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
27 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
28 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
29 longer be retained by the member states.
30 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
31 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
-10-

LB270 LB270
2025 2025
1 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
2 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
3 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
4 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
5 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
6 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
7 such request.
8 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
9 General.
10 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
11 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
12 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
13 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:
14 (i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement
15 and state law;
16 (ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information
17 Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
18 (iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
19 taxpayer information;
20 (iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of
21 federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the
22 Internal Revenue Service; and
23 (v) Collect, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise use anonymous data
24 for governmental purposes.
25 Sec. 2. Original section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative
26 Supplement, 2024, is repealed.
