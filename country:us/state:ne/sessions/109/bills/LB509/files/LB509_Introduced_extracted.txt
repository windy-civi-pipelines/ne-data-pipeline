22 calendar year 2028 and each calendar year thereafter shall be calculated
23 by taking the annual limit from the prior calendar year and then
24 multiplying such amount by (a) one hundred twenty-five percent if the
25 intended tax credit amounts in the prior calendar year exceeded ninety
26 percent of the annual limit applicable to that calendar year or (b) one
27 hundred percent if the intended tax credit amounts in the prior calendar
28 year did not exceed ninety percent of the annual limit applicable to that
29 calendar year. The annual limit may be increased as provided in this
30 subsection until it reaches one hundred million dollars. Thereafter, no
31 further increases shall be allowed.

16 citizens to encourage individuals and businesses to support organizations
17 that financially assist parents and legal guardians who want to enroll

17 adjusted gross income that portion of the estate's or trust's Nebraska
18 income, as determined under sections 77-2724 and 77-2725, allocable to
19 his or her interest in the estate or trust and (b) a reduction of the
20 Nebraska tax liability by his or her proportionate share of the credits
21 as provided in the Angel Investment Tax Credit Act, the Nebraska
22 Advantage Microenterprise Tax Credit Act, the Nebraska Advantage Research

2 and sections 77-27,238, 77-27,240, and 77-27,241 and shall execute and
3 forward to the fiduciary, on or before the original due date of the
4 Nebraska fiduciary return, an agreement which states that he or she will
5 file a Nebraska income tax return and pay income tax on all income
6 derived from or connected with sources in this state, and such agreement
7 shall be attached to the Nebraska fiduciary return for such taxable year.
8 (5) In the absence of the nonresident beneficiary's executed
9 agreement being attached to the Nebraska fiduciary return, the estate or
10 trust shall remit a portion of such beneficiary's income which was
11 derived from or attributable to Nebraska sources with its Nebraska return
12 for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning or deemed to begin
13 before January 1, 2013, the amount of remittance, in such instance, shall
14 be the highest individual income tax rate determined under section
15 77-2715.02 multiplied by the nonresident beneficiary's share of the
16 estate or trust income which was derived from or attributable to sources
17 within this state. For taxable years beginning or deemed to begin on or
18 after January 1, 2013, the amount of remittance, in such instance, shall
19 be the highest individual income tax rate determined under section
20 77-2715.03 multiplied by the nonresident beneficiary's share of the
21 estate or trust income which was derived from or attributable to sources
22 within this state. The amount remitted shall be allowed as a credit
23 against the Nebraska income tax liability of the beneficiary.
24 (6) The Tax Commissioner may allow a nonresident beneficiary to not
25 file a Nebraska income tax return if the nonresident beneficiary's only
26 source of Nebraska income was his or her share of the estate's or trust's
27 income which was derived from or attributable to sources within this
28 state, the nonresident did not file an agreement to file a Nebraska
29 income tax return, and the estate or trust has remitted the amount
30 required by subsection (5) of this section on behalf of such nonresident
31 beneficiary. The amount remitted shall be retained in satisfaction of the

5 does not allow amounts to be paid, permanently set aside, or used in the
6 tax year for charitable purposes, and (c) does not distribute amounts
7 allocated in the corpus of the trust. Any trust which does not qualify as
8 a simple trust shall be deemed a complex trust.

10 trust that is a grantor trust of a nonresident shall be disregarded and
11 this section shall apply as though the nonresident grantor was the
12 beneficiary.
