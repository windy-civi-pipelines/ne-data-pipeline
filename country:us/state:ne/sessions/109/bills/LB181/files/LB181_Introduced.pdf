1 care services available pursuant to sections 68-915 and 68-972 to unborn
2 children, whose eligibility is independent of the mother's eligibility
3 status, shall not be deemed to be tied to the immigration status of the
4 mother and therefor are not included in the restrictions imposed by
5 section 4-108.
6 Sec. 2. Section 43-4501, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 43-4501 Sections 43-4501 to 43-4514 and section 3 of this act shall
9 be known and may be cited as the Young Adult Bridge to Independence Act.
10 Sec. 3. Services provided under the Young Adult Bridge to
11 Independence Act apply to young adults as described in section 43-4504
12 notwithstanding the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
13 Reconciliation Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193, and other limitations on
14 an immigrant's ability to access public benefits, pursuant to the
15 authority provided in 8 U.S.C. 1621(d), as such section existed on
16 January 1, 2025. Beginning January 1, 2026, the bridge to independence

30 public benefits, so that a young adult participating in the bridge to
31 independence program receives medical care under the medical assistance
-3-

LB181 LB181
2025 2025
1 program, whether or not such young adult is lawfully present. Medical
2 care shall be provided pursuant to Title XIX or Title XXI of the federal
3 Social Security Act. If a young adult is not eligible under either Title
4 XIX or Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act, the department shall
5 identify and pursue all other coverage options including, but not limited
6 to, payment from the General Fund;
7 (2) Medical care under the medical assistance program for young
8 adults who meet the eligibility requirements of subdivision (2)(c) of
9 section 43-4504, are eligible for a category of medical assistance
10 pursuant to section 68-915 or other medical assistance category under
11 federal law, and have signed a voluntary services and support agreement
12 as provided in section 43-4506;
13 (3) Housing, placement, and support in the form of foster care
14 maintenance payments which shall remain at least at the rate set
15 immediately prior to the young adult's exit from foster care. As decided
16 by and with the young adult, young adults may reside in a foster family
17 home, a supervised independent living setting, an institution, or a
18 foster care facility. Placement in an institution or a foster care
19 facility should occur only if necessary due to a young adult's
20 developmental level or medical condition. A young adult who is residing
21 in a foster care facility upon leaving foster care may choose to
22 temporarily stay until he or she is able to transition to a more age-
23 appropriate setting. For young adults residing in a supervised
24 independent living setting:
25 (a) The department may send all or part of the foster care
26 maintenance payments directly to the young adult. This should be decided
27 on a case-by-case basis by and with the young adult in a manner that
28 respects the independence of the young adult; and
29 (b) Rules and restrictions regarding housing options should be
30 respectful of the young adult's autonomy and developmental maturity.
31 Specifically, safety assessments of the living arrangements shall be age-
-4-

2025 2025
1 appropriate and consistent with federal guidance on a supervised setting
2 in which the individual lives independently. A clean background check
3 shall not be required for an individual residing in the same residence as
4 the young adult; and
5 (4) Case management services that are young-adult driven. Case
6 management shall be a continuation of the independent living transition
7 proposal in section 43-1311.03, including a written description of
8 additional resources that will help the young adult in creating permanent
9 relationships and preparing for the transition to adulthood and
10 independent living. Case management shall include the development of a
11 case plan, developed jointly by the department and the young adult, that
12 includes a description of the identified housing situation or living
13 arrangement, the resources to assist the young adult in the transition
14 from the bridge to independence program to adulthood, and the needs
15 listed in subsection (1) of section 43-1311.03. The case plan shall
16 incorporate the independent living transition proposal in section
17 43-1311.03. A new plan shall be developed for young adults who have no
18 previous independent living transition proposal. Case management shall
19 also include, but not be limited to, documentation that assistance has
20 been offered and provided that would help the young adult meet his or her
21 personal goals, if such assistance is appropriate and if the young adult
22 is eligible and consents to receive such assistance. This shall include,
23 but not be limited to, assisting the young adult to:
24 (a) Obtain employment or other financial support;
25 (b) Obtain a government-issued identification card;
26 (c) Open and maintain a bank account;

28 health, developmental disability, and other disability services and
