12 Legislative Council shall, for vacation leave entitlement purposes, be
13 credited with one continuous year of employment for each two hundred
14 sixty working days such state employee was employed by the Legislature or
15 Legislative Council.
16 (4) As used in this section, state employee shall mean any person or
17 officer employed by the state including the head of any department or
18 agency, except when such a head is a board or commission, and who works a

LB34 LB34
2025 2025
1 accumulated as of such time the number of hours of vacation leave which
2 he or she earned during that calendar year. Hours of vacation leave
3 accumulated in excess of that number shall be forfeited. Any state
4 employee shall be entitled to use any vacation time as soon as it has
5 accrued. Any vacation time not used within one calendar year following
6 the calendar year during which the time accrued shall be forfeited. In
7 special and meritorious cases, when to limit the annual leave to the
8 period therein specified would work a peculiar hardship, such leave may
9 be extended in the discretion of the Governor, or in situations involving
10 employees of the Legislature, in the discretion of the Executive Board of
11 the Legislative Council.
12 (7) It is the responsibility of the head of an employing agency to
13 provide reasonable opportunity for a state employee to use rather than
14 forfeit accumulated vacation leave. If a state employee makes a
15 reasonable written request to use vacation leave before the leave must be
16 forfeited under this section and the employing agency denies the request,
17 the employing agency shall pay the state employee the cash equivalent of
18 the amount of forfeited vacation leave that was requested and denied.
19 Such cash payment shall be made within thirty days after the requested
20 and denied vacation leave is forfeited under this section. Such cash
21 payment shall be considered compensation for purposes of a state
22 employee's retirement benefit in a defined contribution or cash balance
23 benefit plan administered by the Public Employees Retirement Board but
24 shall not be considered compensation for purposes of a state employee's
25 retirement benefit in any other defined benefit plan administered by the
26 Public Employees Retirement Board. In determining whether a state
27 employeeâ€™s request to use vacation leave is reasonable, the employing
28 agency shall consider the amount of vacation leave requested, the number
29 of days remaining prior to forfeiture during which the state employee may
30 take vacation leave, the amount of notice given to the employing agency
31 prior to the requested vacation leave, any effects on public safety, and
-6-

1 other relevant factors. This subsection shall not apply to state
2 employees who are exempt from the State Personnel System pursuant to
3 subdivisions (1)(g) and (h) of section 81-1316.
4 (8) Each state employee, upon retirement, dismissal, or voluntary
5 separation from state employment, shall be paid for unused accumulated
6 vacation leave. Upon the death of a state employee, the his or her
7 beneficiary of the state employee shall be paid for unused accumulated
8 vacation leave.
9 (9) A permanent state employee who is transferred from one agency to
10 another shall have his or her accrued vacation leave transferred to the
11 receiving agency.
12 (10) The Director of Personnel shall adopt and promulgate such rules
13 and regulations as are necessary to administer this section.
14 Sec. 6. Original sections 49-1301, 49-1302, 81-1323, and 81-1328,
15 Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and section 32-908, Revised
16 Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
