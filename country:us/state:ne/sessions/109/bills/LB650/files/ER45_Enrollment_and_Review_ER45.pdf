2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 8 of this act shall be known and may be

5 Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby finds that areas of chronic economic

9 to completely resolve certain problems such as overcrowding,
10 unemployment, and poor health and sanitary conditions in a community
11 which lead to further deterioration. Such problems cannot be remedied by
12 the government alone, but can be alleviated through a partnership between
13 the government and private enterprise. It is therefore declared to be
14 public policy in this state to encourage contributions by business firms
15 and individuals that offer and provide community and neighborhood
16 assistance and community services.

18 unless the context otherwise requires:

3 personal property sold at retail in this state; the gross receipts of
4 every person engaged as a public utility, as a community antenna
5 television service operator, or as a satellite service operator, any
6 person involved in the connecting and installing of the services defined
7 in subdivision (2)(a), (b), (d), or (e) of section 77-2701.16, or every
8 person engaged as a retailer of intellectual or entertainment properties
9 referred to in subsection (3) of section 77-2701.16; the gross receipts
10 from the sale of admissions in this state; the gross receipts from the
11 sale of warranties, guarantees, service agreements, or maintenance
12 agreements when the items covered are subject to tax under this section;
13 beginning January 1, 2008, the gross receipts from the sale of bundled
14 transactions when one or more of the products included in the bundle are
15 taxable; the gross receipts from the provision of services defined in
16 subsection (4) of section 77-2701.16; and the gross receipts from the
17 sale of products delivered electronically as described in subsection (9)
18 of section 77-2701.16. Except as provided in section 77-2701.03, when
19 there is a sale, the tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the
20 time the gross receipts are realized under the accounting basis used by
21 the retailer to maintain his or her books and records.
22 (a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the
23 retailer from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase
24 price and until collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the
25 retailer and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other
26 debts. The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the consumer
27 constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this state.
28 (b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state
29 to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or
30 part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will
31 not be added to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property
-43-

ER45 ER45
LB650 LB650
MJP - 04/18/2025 MJP - 04/18/2025
1 sold, rented, or leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will
2 be refunded. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a
3 public utility.
4 (c) The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the
5 purchaser, unless otherwise provided by statute or by rule and regulation
6 of the Tax Commissioner, shall be displayed separately from the list
7 price, the price advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other
8 price on the sales check or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.
9 (d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment,
10 collection, and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of
11 the retailer in collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax
12 Commissioner to provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be
13 collected from the consumer or user to effectuate the computation and
14 collection of the tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such
15 schedule or schedules shall provide that the tax shall be collected from
16 the consumer or user uniformly on sales according to brackets based on
17 sales prices of the item or items. Retailers may compute the tax due on
18 any transaction on an item or an invoice basis. The rounding rule
19 provided in section 77-3,117 applies.

25 of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the retail
26 sales tax, it shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to
27 the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a
28 sale of property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the
29 sale unless he or she takes from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate
30 to the effect that the property is purchased for the purpose of
31 reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an exemption certificate pursuant

1 to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a direct payment permit
2 pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of a resale
3 certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
4 conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was
5 exempt or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
6 (g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
7 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle
8 Registration Act, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental
9 or lease price, except as otherwise provided within this section.
10 (h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
11 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of
12 one year or more, the lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales
13 tax on the gross receipts and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such
14 vehicle. If such election is made, it shall be made pursuant to the
15 following conditions:
16 (i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with
17 the Tax Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax
18 Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all
19 conditions of this subsection and all rules and regulations of the Tax
20 Commissioner;
21 (ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for
22 a period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the
23 lessor elects to terminate the election;
24 (iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of
25 the lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except
26 vehicles to be leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the
27 lessor a valid common or contract carrier exemption certificate. If the
28 lessor rents or leases other vehicles for periods of less than one year,
29 such lessor shall maintain his or her books and records and his or her
30 accounting procedure as the Tax Commissioner prescribes; and
31 (iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the

17 prescribe and containing such information as the Tax Commissioner deems
18 necessary for the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of
19 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he or she deems it necessary in order to
20 insure payment to or facilitate the collection by the state of the amount
21 of sales or use taxes due, may require returns and payment of the amount
22 of such taxes for periods other than monthly periods in the case of a
23 particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case may be. The Tax
24 Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and tax
25 payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
26 tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
27 agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers',
28 or purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars,
29 quarterly returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine
30 hundred dollars or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly
31 returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand
-54-

1 dollars or more. The Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow
2 an annual return for seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax
3 liability exceeds the amounts listed in this subdivision.
4 The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
5 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
6 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
7 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
8 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
9 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
10 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
11 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
12 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
13 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
14 amount shall be imposed.
15 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
16 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
17 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
18 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
19 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
20 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use
21 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
22 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
23 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
24 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
25 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
26 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
27 but need not be verified by oath.
28 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
29 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
30 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
31 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
-55-

ER45 ER45
LB650 LB650
MJP - 04/18/2025 MJP - 04/18/2025
1 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
2 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
3 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
4 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
5 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
6 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
7 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
8 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
9 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
10 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
11 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
12 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
13 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
14 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
15 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
16 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
17 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
18 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
19 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
20 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the
21 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
22 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
23 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
24 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
25 notified the Tax Commissioner.
26 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
27 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
28 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
29 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
30 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
31 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
-56-

ER45 ER45
LB650 LB650
MJP - 04/18/2025 MJP - 04/18/2025
1 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
2 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
3 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
4 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
5 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
6 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
7 penalty shall be five dollars.
8 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
9 due from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three
10 percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to
11 reimburse himself or herself for the cost of collecting the tax.
12 Taxpayers filing a combined return as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii)
13 of this subsection shall compute such collection fees on the basis of the
14 receipts and liability of each licensed location.
15 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
16 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
17 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
18 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
19 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
20 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
21 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
22 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
23 provided in section 77-2704.35.
24 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
25 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
26 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
27 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
28 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
29 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
30 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
31 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
-57-

ER45 ER45
LB650 LB650
MJP - 04/18/2025 MJP - 04/18/2025
1 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
2 marketplace platform operator.
3 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
4 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
5 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
6 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
7 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
8 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
9 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
10 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
11 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
12 executors.
13 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
14 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
15 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
16 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
17 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
18 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
19 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
20 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been
21 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
22 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
23 account of overpayment.
24 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
25 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
26 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
27 dollars.
28 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
29 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
30 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
31 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
-58-

ER45 ER45
LB650 LB650
MJP - 04/18/2025 MJP - 04/18/2025
1 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
2 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
3 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
4 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
5 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
6 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
7 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
8 determination.
9 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
10 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
11 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
12 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided
13 in section 77-27,127.
14 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
15 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
16 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
17 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
18 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
19 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
20 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is
21 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
22 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
23 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
24 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
25 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
26 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
27 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
28 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
29 filed.
30 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
31 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
-59-

ER45 ER45
LB650 LB650
MJP - 04/18/2025 MJP - 04/18/2025
1 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
2 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
3 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
4 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
5 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
6 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
7 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
8 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
9 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
10 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
11 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
12 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
13 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
14 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
15 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
16 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
17 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
18 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
19 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
20 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income
21 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
22 return.
23 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
24 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
25 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
26 which the collection is made.
27 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
28 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
29 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
30 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
31 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.

1 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
2 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
3 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
4 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
5 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
6 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
7 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
8 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
9 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
10 other charges.
11 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
12 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
13 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
14 the state shall permit the allocation.
15 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
16 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
17 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
18 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
19 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
20 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
21 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
22 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
23 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
24 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
25 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
26 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
27 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
28 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
29 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
30 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
31 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of

16 regulations, or perform any other duties imposed by such act.
17 (3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing,
18 using, or otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a
19 retailer shall keep such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent
20 papers in such form as the Tax Commissioner may reasonably require.
21 (b) Every such seller, retailer, or person shall keep such records
22 for not less than three years from the making of such records unless the
23 Tax Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
24 (4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him
25 or her may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any
26 person selling property and any person liable for the use tax and may
27 investigate the character of the business of the person in order to
28 verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the
29 person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the
30 examination of any person selling property or of any person liable for
31 the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as to the accuracy of the reporting

3 and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made between the various
4 counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the tax due. The
5 Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
6 exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person
7 having custody of the records for providing such copies.
8 (5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her
9 records at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records
10 available to the Tax Commissioner at all times.
11 (6) In administration of the use tax, the Tax Commissioner may
12 require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in
13 his, her, or their possession or custody information relating to sales of
14 property, the storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to
15 the tax. The report shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and
16 shall set forth the names and addresses of purchasers of the property,
17 the sales price of the property, the date of sale, and such other
18 information as the Tax Commissioner may require.
19 (7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner or
20 any official or employee of the Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, or
21 the Department of Administrative Services to make known in any manner
22 whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an
23 investigation of records and activities of any retailer or any other

18 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
19 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure

21 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
22 and
23 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
24 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
25 unauthorized access and disclosure.
26 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
27 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the

3 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
4 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
5 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
6 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
7 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
8 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
9 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
10 such request.
11 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
12 General.
13 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
14 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
15 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
16 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:

1 Relief Credit Fund pursuant to section 77-4602, such amount shall be
2 added to the minimum amount required under subdivision (1)(a) of this
3 section when determining the total amount of relief granted under the act
4 for the tax year in which the transfer occurs. If no such transfer occurs

14 district taxes levied in the prior year on the parcel to the school

24 credit which cannot be used by the taxpayer shall be returned to the
25 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
26 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall

3 (4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be
4 equal to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of
5 this section multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
6 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
7 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
8 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year
9 thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall determine the amount to
10 be disbursed under this subsection to each county and shall certify such
11 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
