AMENDMENTS TO LB650
Introduced by Revenue.
2 sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 8 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Community Development Assistance Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby finds that areas of chronic economic
6 distress in the State of Nebraska are a detriment to the economic well-
7 being, health, and safety of the citizens of Nebraska. The Legislature
8 further contends that current governmental solutions have not been able
9 to completely resolve certain problems such as overcrowding,
10 unemployment, and poor health and sanitary conditions in a community
11 which lead to further deterioration. Such problems cannot be remedied by
12 the government alone, but can be alleviated through a partnership between
13 the government and private enterprise. It is therefore declared to be
14 public policy in this state to encourage contributions by business firms
15 and individuals that offer and provide community and neighborhood
16 assistance and community services.

24 there is a sale, the tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the
25 time the gross receipts are realized under the accounting basis used by
26 the retailer to maintain his or her books and records.
27 (a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the
28 retailer from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase
29 price and until collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the
30 retailer and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other
31 debts. The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the consumer

1 constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this state.
2 (b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state
3 to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or
4 part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will
5 not be added to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property
6 sold, rented, or leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will
7 be refunded. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a
8 public utility.

12 price, the price advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other
13 price on the sales check or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.
14 (d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment,
15 collection, and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of
16 the retailer in collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax
17 Commissioner to provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be
18 collected from the consumer or user to effectuate the computation and
19 collection of the tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such
20 schedule or schedules shall provide that the tax shall be collected from
21 the consumer or user uniformly on sales according to brackets based on
22 sales prices of the item or items. Retailers may compute the tax due on

1 the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a
2 sale of property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the
3 sale unless he or she takes from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate
4 to the effect that the property is purchased for the purpose of
5 reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an exemption certificate pursuant
6 to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a direct payment permit
7 pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of a resale
8 certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
9 conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was
10 exempt or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
11 (g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
12 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle
13 Registration Act, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental

16 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of
17 one year or more, the lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales
18 tax on the gross receipts and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such
19 vehicle. If such election is made, it shall be made pursuant to the
20 following conditions:
21 (i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with
22 the Tax Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax

27 a period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the
28 lessor elects to terminate the election;
29 (iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of
30 the lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except
31 vehicles to be leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the

3 such lessor shall maintain his or her books and records and his or her
4 accounting procedure as the Tax Commissioner prescribes; and
5 (iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the
6 contents and form of the notice of election, a procedure for the
7 determination of the tax base of vehicles which are under an existing
8 lease at the time such election becomes effective, the method and manner
9 for terminating such election, and such other rules and regulations as
10 may be necessary for the proper administration of this subdivision.

10 highways of this state within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the
11 tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the
12 purchaser to the county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles. If
13 the tax is not paid on or before the thirtieth day after its purchase,
14 the county treasurer or Department of Motor Vehicles shall also collect

6 difference as a condition for obtaining a certificate of title in this
7 state.
8 (l) The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules

10 by this section so as to insure that the full amount of any applicable
11 tax is paid in cases in which a sale is made of which a part is subject
12 to the taxes imposed by this section and a part of which is not so
13 subject and a separate accounting is not practical or economical.
14 (2) A use tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other
15 consumption in this state of property purchased, leased, or rented from
16 any retailer and on any transaction the gross receipts of which are
17 subject to tax under subsection (1) of this section on or after June 1,
18 1967, for storage, use, or other consumption in this state at the rate

23 state property purchased from a retailer or leased or rented from another
24 person for such purpose shall be liable for the use tax at the rate in
25 effect when his or her liability for the use tax becomes certain under
26 the accounting basis used to maintain his or her books and records. His
27 or her liability shall not be extinguished until the use tax has been
28 paid to this state, except that a receipt from a retailer engaged in
29 business in this state or from a retailer who is authorized by the Tax
30 Commissioner, under such rules and regulations as he or she may
31 prescribe, to collect the sales tax and who is, for the purposes of the

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 relating to the sales tax, regarded as a
2 retailer engaged in business in this state, which receipt is given to the
3 purchaser pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be
4 sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to
5 which the receipt refers.
6 (b) Every retailer engaged in business in this state and selling,
7 leasing, or renting property for storage, use, or other consumption in
8 this state shall, at the time of making any sale, collect any tax which
9 may be due from the purchaser and shall give to the purchaser, upon
10 request, a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Tax
11 Commissioner.
12 (c) The Tax Commissioner, in order to facilitate the proper
13 administration of the use tax, may designate such person or persons as he
14 or she may deem necessary to be use tax collectors and delegate to such
15 persons such authority as is necessary to collect any use tax which is
16 due and payable to the State of Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner may
17 require of all persons so designated a surety bond in favor of the State
18 of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of state funds so
19 collected. The Tax Commissioner may require any tax official, city,
20 county, or state, to collect the use tax on behalf of the state. All
21 persons designated to or required to collect the use tax shall account
22 for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
23 Nothing in this subdivision shall be so construed as to prevent the Tax
24 Commissioner or his or her employees from collecting any use taxes due
25 and payable to the State of Nebraska.
26 (d) All persons designated to collect the use tax and all persons
27 required to collect the use tax shall forward the total of such
28 collections to the Tax Commissioner at such time and in such manner as
29 the Tax Commissioner may prescribe. Such collectors of the use tax shall
30 deduct and withhold from the amount of taxes collected two and one-half
31 three percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each

AM923 AM923
LB650 LB650

1 month as reimbursement for the cost of collecting the tax. Any such
2 deduction shall be forfeited to the State of Nebraska if such collector
3 violates any rule, regulation, or directive of the Tax Commissioner.
4 (e) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
5 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, it shall be
6 presumed that property sold, leased, or rented by any person for delivery
7 in this state is sold, leased, or rented for storage, use, or other
8 consumption in this state until the contrary is established. The burden
9 of proving the contrary is upon the person who purchases, leases, or
10 rents the property.
11 (f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
12 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, for the sale
13 of property to an advertising agency which purchases the property as an
14 agent for a disclosed or undisclosed principal, the advertising agency is
15 and remains liable for the sales and use tax on the purchase the same as
16 if the principal had made the purchase directly.

18 2024, is amended to read:

2 of such taxes for periods other than monthly periods in the case of a
3 particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case may be. The Tax
4 Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and tax
5 payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
6 tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
7 agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers',
8 or purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars,
9 quarterly returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine
10 hundred dollars or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly
11 returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand
12 dollars or more. The Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow
13 an annual return for seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax
14 liability exceeds the amounts listed in this subdivision.
15 The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
16 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
17 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
18 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
19 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
20 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
21 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
22 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
23 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
24 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
25 amount shall be imposed.
26 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
27 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
28 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
29 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
30 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
31 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use

1 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
2 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
3 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
4 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
5 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
6 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
7 but need not be verified by oath.
8 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
9 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
10 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
11 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
12 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
13 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
14 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
15 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
16 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
17 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
18 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
19 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
20 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
21 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
22 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
23 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
24 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
25 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
26 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
27 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
28 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
29 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
30 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
31 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
2 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
3 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
4 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
5 notified the Tax Commissioner.
6 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
7 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
8 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
9 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
10 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
11 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
12 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
13 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
14 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
15 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
16 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
17 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
18 penalty shall be five dollars.
19 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
20 due from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three
21 percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to
22 reimburse himself or herself for the cost of collecting the tax.
23 Taxpayers filing a combined return as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii)
24 of this subsection shall compute such collection fees on the basis of the
25 receipts and liability of each licensed location.
26 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
27 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
28 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
29 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
30 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
31 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
-56-
AM923 AM923
LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
2 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
3 provided in section 77-2704.35.
4 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
5 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
6 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
7 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
8 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
9 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
10 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
11 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
12 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
13 marketplace platform operator.
14 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
15 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
16 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
17 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
18 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
19 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
20 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
21 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
22 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
23 executors.
24 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
25 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
26 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
27 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
28 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
29 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
30 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
31 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
2 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
3 account of overpayment.
4 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
5 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
6 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
7 dollars.
8 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
9 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
10 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
11 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
12 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
13 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
14 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
15 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
16 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
17 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
18 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
19 determination.
20 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
21 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
22 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
23 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided
24 in section 77-27,127.
25 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
26 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
27 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
28 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
29 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
30 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
31 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is

MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
2 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
3 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
4 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
5 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
6 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
7 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
8 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
9 filed.
10 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
11 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
12 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
13 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
14 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
15 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
16 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
17 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
18 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
19 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
20 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
21 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
22 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
23 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
24 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
25 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
26 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
27 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
28 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
29 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
30 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
31 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income

MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
2 return.
3 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
4 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
5 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
6 which the collection is made.
7 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
8 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
9 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
10 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
11 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.
12 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
13 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
14 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
15 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
16 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
17 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
18 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
19 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
20 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
21 other charges.
22 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
23 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
24 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
25 the state shall permit the allocation.
26 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
27 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
28 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
29 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
30 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
31 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
-60-
AM923 AM923
LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
2 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
3 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
4 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
5 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
6 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
7 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
8 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
9 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
10 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
11 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of
12 section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable. This subsection shall not
13 apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision (2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii)
14 or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
15 Sec. 40. Section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
16 2024, is amended to read:
17 77-2711 (1)(a) The Tax Commissioner shall enforce sections
18 77-2701.04 to 77-2713 and may prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and
19 regulations relating to the administration and enforcement of such
20 sections.
21 (b) The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the extent to which any
22 ruling or regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.
23 (2) The Tax Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors,
24 investigators, assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient
25 administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and may delegate
26 authority to his or her representatives to conduct hearings, prescribe
27 regulations, or perform any other duties imposed by such act.
28 (3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing,
29 using, or otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a
30 retailer shall keep such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent
31 papers in such form as the Tax Commissioner may reasonably require.

1 (b) Every such seller, retailer, or person shall keep such records
2 for not less than three years from the making of such records unless the
3 Tax Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
4 (4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him
5 or her may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any
6 person selling property and any person liable for the use tax and may
7 investigate the character of the business of the person in order to
8 verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the
9 person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the
10 examination of any person selling property or of any person liable for
11 the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as to the accuracy of the reporting
12 of city and county sales and use taxes for which the person is liable
13 under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections 13-319, 13-324, 13-2813,
14 and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made between the various
15 counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the tax due. The
16 Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
17 exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person
18 having custody of the records for providing such copies.
19 (5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her
20 records at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records
21 available to the Tax Commissioner at all times.
22 (6) In administration of the use tax, the Tax Commissioner may
23 require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in
24 his, her, or their possession or custody information relating to sales of
25 property, the storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to
26 the tax. The report shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and
27 shall set forth the names and addresses of purchasers of the property,
28 the sales price of the property, the date of sale, and such other
29 information as the Tax Commissioner may require.
30 (7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner or
31 any official or employee of the Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, or

14 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
15 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
16 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
17 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 thereafter, the minimum total amount of relief granted under the act
2 shall be the minimum total amount of relief from the prior year,
3 excluding any additional relief provided pursuant to subdivision (1)(b)
4 of this section, with such amount then increased by three percent; and .
5 (b) If money is transferred to the School District Property Tax
6 Relief Credit Fund pursuant to section 77-4602, such amount shall be
7 added to the minimum amount required under subdivision (1)(a) of this
8 section when determining the total amount of relief granted under the act
9 for the tax year in which the transfer occurs. If no such transfer occurs
10 in a given tax year, the minimum amount required under subdivision (1)(a)
11 of this section shall be the total amount of relief granted under the act
12 for such tax year. The relief shall be in the form of property tax
13 credits which appear on property tax statements. Property tax credits
14 granted under the act shall be credited against the amount of property
15 taxes owed to school districts.
16 (2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each
17 parcel, the county treasurer shall multiply the amount disbursed to the
18 county under subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school
19 district taxes levied in the prior year on the parcel to the school

21 county. The amount so determined shall be the property tax credit for
22 that parcel.

24 under sections 77-3501 to 77-3529, the owner shall also be qualified for
25 the property tax credit provided in this section to the extent of any
26 remaining liability after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the
27 property tax credit provided in this section results in a property tax
28 liability on the homestead that is less than zero, the amount of the
29 credit which cannot be used by the taxpayer shall be returned to the
30 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
31 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall

MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025

2 District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund. Upon the return of any funds
3 under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a
4 report with the Property Tax Administrator, on a form prescribed by the
5 Tax Commissioner, indicating the amount of funds distributed to each
6 school district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the
7 amount of unused credits returned.
8 (4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be
9 equal to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of
10 this section multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
11 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
12 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
13 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year
14 thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall determine the amount to
15 be disbursed under this subsection to each county and shall certify such
16 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
17 the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on or before
18 January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
19 (5) The county treasurer shall disburse amounts received under
20 subsection (4) of this section, which are credited against the amount of
21 property taxes owed to school districts, in the same manner as if such
22 funds had been received in the form of property tax payments for property
23 taxes owed to school districts, meaning any amounts attributable to
24 divided taxes pursuant to section 18-2147 of the Community Development
25 Law shall be remitted to the applicable authority for which such taxes

AMENDMENTS TO LB650
Introduced by Revenue.
1 1. Strike the original sections and insert the following new
2 sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 8 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Community Development Assistance Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby finds that areas of chronic economic
6 distress in the State of Nebraska are a detriment to the economic well-
7 being, health, and safety of the citizens of Nebraska. The Legislature
8 further contends that current governmental solutions have not been able
9 to completely resolve certain problems such as overcrowding,
10 unemployment, and poor health and sanitary conditions in a community
11 which lead to further deterioration. Such problems cannot be remedied by
12 the government alone, but can be alleviated through a partnership between
13 the government and private enterprise. It is therefore declared to be
14 public policy in this state to encourage contributions by business firms
15 and individuals that offer and provide community and neighborhood
16 assistance and community services.
17 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Community Development Assistance Act,
18 unless the context otherwise requires:
19 (1) Area of chronic economic distress means an area of the state
20 which meets any of the following conditions:
21 (a) An unemployment rate which exceeds the statewide average
22 unemployment rate;
23 (b) A per capita income below the statewide average per capita
24 income; or
25 (c) A population loss between the two most recent federal decennial
26 censuses;

3 Sec. 4. Any community betterment organization which provides
4 community assistance or community services in a community development
5 area may apply any time during the fiscal year to the department to have

22 sale of products delivered electronically as described in subsection (9)
23 of section 77-2701.16. Except as provided in section 77-2701.03, when
24 there is a sale, the tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the
25 time the gross receipts are realized under the accounting basis used by
26 the retailer to maintain his or her books and records.
27 (a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the
28 retailer from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase
29 price and until collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the
30 retailer and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other
31 debts. The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the consumer

1 constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this state.
2 (b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state
3 to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or
4 part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will
5 not be added to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property
6 sold, rented, or leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will
7 be refunded. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a
8 public utility.
9 (c) The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the
10 purchaser, unless otherwise provided by statute or by rule and regulation
11 of the Tax Commissioner, shall be displayed separately from the list
12 price, the price advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other
13 price on the sales check or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.
14 (d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment,
15 collection, and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of
16 the retailer in collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax
17 Commissioner to provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be
18 collected from the consumer or user to effectuate the computation and
19 collection of the tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such
20 schedule or schedules shall provide that the tax shall be collected from
21 the consumer or user uniformly on sales according to brackets based on
22 sales prices of the item or items. Retailers may compute the tax due on
23 any transaction on an item or an invoice basis. The rounding rule
24 provided in section 77-3,117 applies.
25 (e) The use of tokens or stamps for the purpose of collecting or
26 enforcing the collection of the taxes imposed in the Nebraska Revenue Act
27 of 1967 or for any other purpose in connection with such taxes is
28 prohibited.
29 (f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions
30 of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the retail
31 sales tax, it shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to

1 the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a
2 sale of property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the
3 sale unless he or she takes from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate
4 to the effect that the property is purchased for the purpose of
5 reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an exemption certificate pursuant
6 to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a direct payment permit
7 pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of a resale
8 certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
9 conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was
10 exempt or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
11 (g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
12 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle
13 Registration Act, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental
14 or lease price, except as otherwise provided within this section.
15 (h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
16 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of
17 one year or more, the lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales
18 tax on the gross receipts and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such
19 vehicle. If such election is made, it shall be made pursuant to the
20 following conditions:
21 (i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with
22 the Tax Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax
23 Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all
24 conditions of this subsection and all rules and regulations of the Tax
25 Commissioner;
26 (ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for
27 a period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the
28 lessor elects to terminate the election;
29 (iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of
30 the lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except
31 vehicles to be leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the

1 lessor a valid common or contract carrier exemption certificate. If the
2 lessor rents or leases other vehicles for periods of less than one year,
3 such lessor shall maintain his or her books and records and his or her
4 accounting procedure as the Tax Commissioner prescribes; and
5 (iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the
6 contents and form of the notice of election, a procedure for the
7 determination of the tax base of vehicles which are under an existing
8 lease at the time such election becomes effective, the method and manner
9 for terminating such election, and such other rules and regulations as
10 may be necessary for the proper administration of this subdivision.
11 (i) The tax imposed by this section on the sales of motor vehicles,
12 semitrailers, and trailers as defined in sections 60-339, 60-348, and
13 60-354 shall be the liability of the purchaser and, with the exception of
14 motor vehicles, semitrailers, and trailers registered pursuant to section
15 60-3,198, the tax shall be collected by the county treasurer as provided
16 in the Motor Vehicle Registration Act or by an approved licensed dealer
17 participating in the electronic dealer services system pursuant to
18 section 60-1507 at the time the purchaser makes application for the
19 registration of the motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation
20 upon the highways of this state. The tax imposed by this section on motor
21 vehicles, semitrailers, and trailers registered pursuant to section
22 60-3,198 shall be collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles at the
23 time the purchaser makes application for the registration of the motor
24 vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation upon the highways of this
25 state. At the time of the sale of any motor vehicle, semitrailer, or
26 trailer, the seller shall (i) state on the sales invoice the dollar
27 amount of the tax imposed under this section and (ii) furnish to the
28 purchaser a certified statement of the transaction, in such form as the
29 Tax Commissioner prescribes, setting forth as a minimum the total sales
30 price, the allowance for any trade-in, and the difference between the
31 two. The sales tax due shall be computed on the difference between the

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 total sales price and the allowance for any trade-in as disclosed by such
2 certified statement. Any seller who willfully understates the amount upon
3 which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one thousand
4 dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to
5 the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such
6 certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon
7 conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five
8 dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not
9 register such motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation on the
10 highways of this state within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the
11 tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the
12 purchaser to the county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles. If
13 the tax is not paid on or before the thirtieth day after its purchase,
14 the county treasurer or Department of Motor Vehicles shall also collect
15 from the purchaser interest from the thirtieth day through the date of
16 payment and sales tax penalties as provided in the Nebraska Revenue Act
17 of 1967. The county treasurer or Department of Motor Vehicles shall
18 report and remit the tax so collected to the Tax Commissioner by the
19 fifteenth day of the following month. The county treasurer, for his or
20 her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold, from all amounts required
21 to be collected under this subsection, the collection fee permitted to be
22 deducted by any retailer collecting the sales tax, all of which shall be
23 deposited in the county general fund, plus an additional amount equal to
24 one-half of one percent of all amounts in excess of six thousand dollars
25 remitted each month. Prior to January 1, 2023, fifty percent of such
26 additional amount shall be deposited in the county general fund and fifty
27 percent of such additional amount shall be deposited in the county road
28 fund. On and after January 1, 2023, seventy-five percent of such
29 additional amount shall be deposited in the county general fund and

2 of his or her collection fee for each of the first five thousand motor
3 vehicles, semitrailers, or trailers registered with such county treasurer
4 on or after January 1, 2020, to the State Treasurer for credit to the
5 Department of Revenue Enforcement Fund. The Department of Motor Vehicles,
6 for its collection fee, shall deduct, withhold, and deposit in the Motor
7 Carrier Division Cash Fund the collection fee permitted to be deducted by
8 any retailer collecting the sales tax. The collection fee for the county
9 treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles shall be forfeited if the
10 county treasurer or department violates any rule or regulation pertaining
11 to the collection of the use tax.
12 (j)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of a motorboat as
13 defined in section 37-1204 shall be the liability of the purchaser. The
14 tax shall be collected by the county treasurer at the time the purchaser
15 makes application for the registration of the motorboat. At the time of
16 the sale of a motorboat, the seller shall (A) state on the sales invoice
17 the dollar amount of the tax imposed under this section and (B) furnish
18 to the purchaser a certified statement of the transaction, in such form
19 as the Tax Commissioner prescribes, setting forth as a minimum the total
20 sales price, the allowance for any trade-in, and the difference between
21 the two. The sales tax due shall be computed on the difference between
22 the total sales price and the allowance for any trade-in as disclosed by
23 such certified statement. Any seller who willfully understates the amount
24 upon which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one
25 thousand dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be
26 furnished to the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to
27 furnish such certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
28 shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than
29 twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser
30 does not register such motorboat within thirty days of the purchase
31 thereof, the tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter be

4 through the date of payment and sales tax penalties as provided in the
5 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The county treasurer shall report and remit
6 the tax so collected to the Tax Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the
7 following month. The county treasurer, for his or her collection fee,
8 shall deduct and withhold for the use of the county general fund, from
9 all amounts required to be collected under this subsection, the
10 collection fee permitted to be deducted by any retailer collecting the
11 sales tax. The collection fee shall be forfeited if the county treasurer
12 violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the collection of the use
13 tax.
14 (ii) In the rental or lease of motorboats, the tax shall be
15 collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price.
16 (k)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of an all-terrain
17 vehicle as defined in section 60-103 or a utility-type vehicle as defined
18 in section 60-135.01 shall be the liability of the purchaser. The tax
19 shall be collected by the county treasurer or by an approved licensed
20 dealer participating in the electronic dealer services system pursuant to
21 section 60-1507 at the time the purchaser makes application for the
22 certificate of title for the all-terrain vehicle or utility-type vehicle.

24 vehicle, the seller shall (A) state on the sales invoice the dollar
25 amount of the tax imposed under this section and (B) furnish to the
26 purchaser a certified statement of the transaction, in such form as the
27 Tax Commissioner prescribes, setting forth as a minimum the total sales
28 price, the allowance for any trade-in, and the difference between the
29 two. The sales tax due shall be computed on the difference between the

2 dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to
3 the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such
4 certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon
5 conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five
6 dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not
7 obtain a certificate of title for such all-terrain vehicle or utility-
8 type vehicle within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed
9 by this section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to
10 the county treasurer. If the tax is not paid on or before the thirtieth
11 day after its purchase, the county treasurer shall also collect from the
12 purchaser interest from the thirtieth day through the date of payment and
13 sales tax penalties as provided in the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The
14 county treasurer shall report and remit the tax so collected to the Tax
15 Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month. The county
16 treasurer, for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold for
17 the use of the county general fund, from all amounts required to be
18 collected under this subsection, the collection fee permitted to be
19 deducted by any retailer collecting the sales tax. The collection fee
20 shall be forfeited if the county treasurer violates any rule or
21 regulation pertaining to the collection of the use tax.
22 (ii) In the rental or lease of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-
23 type vehicle, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or
24 lease price.
25 (iii) County treasurers are appointed as sales and use tax
26 collectors for all sales of all-terrain vehicles or utility-type vehicles
27 made outside of this state to purchasers or users of all-terrain vehicles
28 or utility-type vehicles which are required to have a certificate of
29 title in this state. The county treasurer shall collect the applicable

1 certificate of title is made. The full use tax on the purchase price
2 shall be collected by the county treasurer if a sales or occupation tax
3 was not paid by the purchaser in the state of purchase. If a sales or
4 occupation tax was lawfully paid in the state of purchase at a rate less
5 than the tax imposed in this state, use tax must be collected on the
6 difference as a condition for obtaining a certificate of title in this
7 state.
8 (l) The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules
9 and regulations for determining the amount subject to the taxes imposed
10 by this section so as to insure that the full amount of any applicable
11 tax is paid in cases in which a sale is made of which a part is subject
12 to the taxes imposed by this section and a part of which is not so
13 subject and a separate accounting is not practical or economical.
14 (2) A use tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other
15 consumption in this state of property purchased, leased, or rented from
16 any retailer and on any transaction the gross receipts of which are
17 subject to tax under subsection (1) of this section on or after June 1,
18 1967, for storage, use, or other consumption in this state at the rate
19 set as provided in subsection (1) of this section on the sales price of
20 the property or, in the case of leases or rentals, of the lease or rental
21 prices.
22 (a) Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this
23 state property purchased from a retailer or leased or rented from another
24 person for such purpose shall be liable for the use tax at the rate in
25 effect when his or her liability for the use tax becomes certain under
26 the accounting basis used to maintain his or her books and records. His
27 or her liability shall not be extinguished until the use tax has been
28 paid to this state, except that a receipt from a retailer engaged in
29 business in this state or from a retailer who is authorized by the Tax
30 Commissioner, under such rules and regulations as he or she may
31 prescribe, to collect the sales tax and who is, for the purposes of the

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 relating to the sales tax, regarded as a
2 retailer engaged in business in this state, which receipt is given to the
3 purchaser pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be
4 sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to
5 which the receipt refers.
6 (b) Every retailer engaged in business in this state and selling,
7 leasing, or renting property for storage, use, or other consumption in
8 this state shall, at the time of making any sale, collect any tax which
9 may be due from the purchaser and shall give to the purchaser, upon
10 request, a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Tax
11 Commissioner.
12 (c) The Tax Commissioner, in order to facilitate the proper
13 administration of the use tax, may designate such person or persons as he
14 or she may deem necessary to be use tax collectors and delegate to such
15 persons such authority as is necessary to collect any use tax which is
16 due and payable to the State of Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner may
17 require of all persons so designated a surety bond in favor of the State
18 of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of state funds so
19 collected. The Tax Commissioner may require any tax official, city,
20 county, or state, to collect the use tax on behalf of the state. All
21 persons designated to or required to collect the use tax shall account
22 for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
23 Nothing in this subdivision shall be so construed as to prevent the Tax
24 Commissioner or his or her employees from collecting any use taxes due
25 and payable to the State of Nebraska.
26 (d) All persons designated to collect the use tax and all persons
27 required to collect the use tax shall forward the total of such
28 collections to the Tax Commissioner at such time and in such manner as
29 the Tax Commissioner may prescribe. Such collectors of the use tax shall
30 deduct and withhold from the amount of taxes collected two and one-half
31 three percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each

1 month as reimbursement for the cost of collecting the tax. Any such
2 deduction shall be forfeited to the State of Nebraska if such collector
3 violates any rule, regulation, or directive of the Tax Commissioner.
4 (e) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
5 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, it shall be
6 presumed that property sold, leased, or rented by any person for delivery
7 in this state is sold, leased, or rented for storage, use, or other
8 consumption in this state until the contrary is established. The burden
9 of proving the contrary is upon the person who purchases, leases, or
10 rents the property.
11 (f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
12 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, for the sale
13 of property to an advertising agency which purchases the property as an
14 agent for a disclosed or undisclosed principal, the advertising agency is
15 and remains liable for the sales and use tax on the purchase the same as
16 if the principal had made the purchase directly.
17 Sec. 39. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
18 2024, is amended to read:
19 77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska
20 Revenue Act of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner
21 monthly on or before the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each
22 monthly period unless otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
23 Act of 1967.
24 (b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each
25 monthly period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require,
26 a return for such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with
27 the Tax Commissioner in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may
28 prescribe and containing such information as the Tax Commissioner deems
29 necessary for the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of
30 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he or she deems it necessary in order to
31 insure payment to or facilitate the collection by the state of the amount

MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 of sales or use taxes due, may require returns and payment of the amount
2 of such taxes for periods other than monthly periods in the case of a
3 particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case may be. The Tax
4 Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and tax
5 payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
6 tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
7 agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers',
8 or purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars,
9 quarterly returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine
10 hundred dollars or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly
11 returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand
12 dollars or more. The Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow
13 an annual return for seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax
14 liability exceeds the amounts listed in this subdivision.
15 The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
16 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
17 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
18 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
19 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
20 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
21 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
22 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
23 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
24 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
25 amount shall be imposed.
26 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
27 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
28 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
29 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
30 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
31 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use

1 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
2 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
3 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
4 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
5 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
6 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
7 but need not be verified by oath.
8 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
9 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
10 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
11 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
12 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
13 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
14 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
15 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
16 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
17 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
18 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
19 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
20 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
21 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
22 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
23 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
24 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
25 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
26 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
27 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
28 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
29 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
30 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
31 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the

1 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
2 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
3 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
4 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
5 notified the Tax Commissioner.
6 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
7 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
8 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
9 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
10 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
11 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
12 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
13 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
14 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
15 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
16 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
17 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
18 penalty shall be five dollars.
19 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
20 due from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three
21 percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to
22 reimburse himself or herself for the cost of collecting the tax.
23 Taxpayers filing a combined return as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii)
24 of this subsection shall compute such collection fees on the basis of the
25 receipts and liability of each licensed location.
26 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
27 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
28 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
29 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
30 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
31 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
-56-

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
2 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
3 provided in section 77-2704.35.
4 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
5 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
6 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
7 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
8 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
9 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
10 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
11 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
12 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
13 marketplace platform operator.
14 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
15 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
16 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
17 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
18 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
19 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
20 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
21 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
22 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
23 executors.
24 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
25 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
26 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
27 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
28 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
29 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
30 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
31 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been
-57-

AM923 AM923
LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
2 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
3 account of overpayment.
4 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
5 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
6 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
7 dollars.
8 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
9 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
10 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
11 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
12 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
13 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
14 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
15 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
16 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
17 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
18 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
19 determination.
20 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
21 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
22 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
23 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided
24 in section 77-27,127.
25 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
26 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
27 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
28 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
29 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
30 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
31 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is
-58-

AM923 AM923
LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
2 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
3 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
4 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
5 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
6 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
7 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
8 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
9 filed.
10 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
11 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
12 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
13 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
14 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
15 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
16 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
17 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
18 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
19 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
20 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
21 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
22 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
23 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
24 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
25 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
26 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
27 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
28 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
29 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
30 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
31 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income
-59-

AM923 AM923
LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
2 return.
3 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
4 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
5 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
6 which the collection is made.
7 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
8 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
9 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
10 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
11 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.
12 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
13 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
14 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
15 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
16 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
17 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
18 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
19 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
20 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
21 other charges.
22 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
23 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
24 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
25 the state shall permit the allocation.
26 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
27 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
28 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
29 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
30 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
31 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
-60-

LB650 LB650
MLU - 04/04/2025 MLU - 04/04/2025
1 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
2 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
3 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
4 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
5 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
6 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
7 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
8 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
9 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
10 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
11 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of
12 section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable. This subsection shall not
13 apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision (2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii)
14 or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
15 Sec. 40. Section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
16 2024, is amended to read:
17 77-2711 (1)(a) The Tax Commissioner shall enforce sections
18 77-2701.04 to 77-2713 and may prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and
19 regulations relating to the administration and enforcement of such
20 sections.
21 (b) The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the extent to which any
22 ruling or regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.
23 (2) The Tax Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors,
24 investigators, assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient
25 administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and may delegate
26 authority to his or her representatives to conduct hearings, prescribe
27 regulations, or perform any other duties imposed by such act.
28 (3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing,
29 using, or otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a
30 retailer shall keep such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent

2 for not less than three years from the making of such records unless the
3 Tax Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
4 (4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him
5 or her may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any
6 person selling property and any person liable for the use tax and may
7 investigate the character of the business of the person in order to
8 verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the
9 person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the
10 examination of any person selling property or of any person liable for
11 the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as to the accuracy of the reporting
12 of city and county sales and use taxes for which the person is liable
13 under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections 13-319, 13-324, 13-2813,
14 and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made between the various
15 counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the tax due. The
16 Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
17 exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person
18 having custody of the records for providing such copies.
19 (5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her
20 records at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records
21 available to the Tax Commissioner at all times.
22 (6) In administration of the use tax, the Tax Commissioner may
23 require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in
24 his, her, or their possession or custody information relating to sales of
25 property, the storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to
26 the tax. The report shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and
27 shall set forth the names and addresses of purchasers of the property,
28 the sales price of the property, the date of sale, and such other
29 information as the Tax Commissioner may require.
30 (7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner or

13 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
14 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined

1 thereafter, the minimum total amount of relief granted under the act
2 shall be the minimum total amount of relief from the prior year,
3 excluding any additional relief provided pursuant to subdivision (1)(b)
4 of this section, with such amount then increased by three percent; and .
5 (b) If money is transferred to the School District Property Tax
6 Relief Credit Fund pursuant to section 77-4602, such amount shall be
7 added to the minimum amount required under subdivision (1)(a) of this
8 section when determining the total amount of relief granted under the act
9 for the tax year in which the transfer occurs. If no such transfer occurs
10 in a given tax year, the minimum amount required under subdivision (1)(a)
11 of this section shall be the total amount of relief granted under the act

13 credits which appear on property tax statements. Property tax credits
14 granted under the act shall be credited against the amount of property
15 taxes owed to school districts.
16 (2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each

28 liability on the homestead that is less than zero, the amount of the
29 credit which cannot be used by the taxpayer shall be returned to the
30 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
31 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall

1 immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection to the School
2 District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund. Upon the return of any funds
3 under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a
4 report with the Property Tax Administrator, on a form prescribed by the
5 Tax Commissioner, indicating the amount of funds distributed to each
6 school district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the
7 amount of unused credits returned.
8 (4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be
9 equal to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of
10 this section multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
11 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
12 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
13 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year
14 thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall determine the amount to
15 be disbursed under this subsection to each county and shall certify such
16 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
17 the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on or before
18 January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
19 (5) The county treasurer shall disburse amounts received under
20 subsection (4) of this section, which are credited against the amount of

23 taxes owed to school districts, meaning any amounts attributable to
24 divided taxes pursuant to section 18-2147 of the Community Development
25 Law shall be remitted to the applicable authority for which such taxes
