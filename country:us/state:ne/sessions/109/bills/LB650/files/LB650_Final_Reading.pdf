2025 2025
1 in subdivision (2)(a), (b), (d), or (e) of section 77-2701.16, or every
2 person engaged as a retailer of intellectual or entertainment properties
3 referred to in subsection (3) of section 77-2701.16; the gross receipts
4 from the sale of admissions in this state; the gross receipts from the
5 sale of warranties, guarantees, service agreements, or maintenance
6 agreements when the items covered are subject to tax under this section;
7 beginning January 1, 2008, the gross receipts from the sale of bundled
8 transactions when one or more of the products included in the bundle are
9 taxable; the gross receipts from the provision of services defined in
10 subsection (4) of section 77-2701.16; and the gross receipts from the
11 sale of products delivered electronically as described in subsection (9)
12 of section 77-2701.16. Except as provided in section 77-2701.03, when
13 there is a sale, the tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the
14 time the gross receipts are realized under the accounting basis used by
15 the retailer to maintain his or her books and records.
16 (a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the
17 retailer from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase
18 price and until collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the
19 retailer and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other
20 debts. The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the consumer
21 constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this state.
22 (b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state
23 to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or
24 part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will
25 not be added to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property
26 sold, rented, or leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will
27 be refunded. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a
28 public utility.
29 (c) The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the
30 purchaser, unless otherwise provided by statute or by rule and regulation
31 of the Tax Commissioner, shall be displayed separately from the list
-45-

2025 2025
1 price, the price advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other
2 price on the sales check or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.
3 (d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment,
4 collection, and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of
5 the retailer in collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax
6 Commissioner to provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be
7 collected from the consumer or user to effectuate the computation and
8 collection of the tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such
9 schedule or schedules shall provide that the tax shall be collected from
10 the consumer or user uniformly on sales according to brackets based on
11 sales prices of the item or items. Retailers may compute the tax due on
12 any transaction on an item or an invoice basis. The rounding rule
13 provided in section 77-3,117 applies.
14 (e) The use of tokens or stamps for the purpose of collecting or
15 enforcing the collection of the taxes imposed in the Nebraska Revenue Act
16 of 1967 or for any other purpose in connection with such taxes is
17 prohibited.
18 (f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions
19 of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the retail
20 sales tax, it shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to
21 the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a
22 sale of property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the
23 sale unless he or she takes from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate
24 to the effect that the property is purchased for the purpose of
25 reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an exemption certificate pursuant
26 to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a direct payment permit
27 pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of a resale
28 certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
29 conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was
30 exempt or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
31 (g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
-46-

LB650 LB650

1 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle
2 Registration Act, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental
3 or lease price, except as otherwise provided within this section.
4 (h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
5 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of
6 one year or more, the lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales
7 tax on the gross receipts and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such
8 vehicle. If such election is made, it shall be made pursuant to the
9 following conditions:
10 (i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with
11 the Tax Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax
12 Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all
13 conditions of this subsection and all rules and regulations of the Tax
14 Commissioner;
15 (ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for
16 a period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the
17 lessor elects to terminate the election;
18 (iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of
19 the lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except
20 vehicles to be leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the
21 lessor a valid common or contract carrier exemption certificate. If the
22 lessor rents or leases other vehicles for periods of less than one year,
23 such lessor shall maintain his or her books and records and his or her
24 accounting procedure as the Tax Commissioner prescribes; and
25 (iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the
26 contents and form of the notice of election, a procedure for the
27 determination of the tax base of vehicles which are under an existing
28 lease at the time such election becomes effective, the method and manner
29 for terminating such election, and such other rules and regulations as
30 may be necessary for the proper administration of this subdivision.

23 which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one thousand
24 dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to

7 of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of state funds so
8 collected. The Tax Commissioner may require any tax official, city,
9 county, or state, to collect the use tax on behalf of the state. All

30 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
31 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
-56-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
2 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
3 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
4 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
5 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
6 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
7 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
8 amount shall be imposed.
9 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
10 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
11 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
12 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
13 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
14 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use
15 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
16 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
17 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
18 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
19 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
20 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
21 but need not be verified by oath.
22 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
23 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
24 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
25 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
26 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
27 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
28 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
29 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
30 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
31 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
-57-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
2 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
3 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
4 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
5 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
6 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
7 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
8 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
9 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
10 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
11 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
12 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
13 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
14 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the
15 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
16 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
17 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
18 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
19 notified the Tax Commissioner.
20 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
21 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
22 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
23 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
24 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
25 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
26 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
27 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
28 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
29 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
30 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
31 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
-58-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 penalty shall be five dollars.
2 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
3 due from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three
4 percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to
5 reimburse himself or herself for the cost of collecting the tax.
6 Taxpayers filing a combined return as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii)
7 of this subsection shall compute such collection fees on the basis of the
8 receipts and liability of each licensed location.
9 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
10 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
11 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
12 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
13 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
14 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
15 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
16 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
17 provided in section 77-2704.35.
18 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
19 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
20 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
21 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
22 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
23 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
24 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
25 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
26 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
27 marketplace platform operator.
28 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
29 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
30 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
31 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
-59-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
2 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
3 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
4 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
5 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
6 executors.
7 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
8 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
9 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
10 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
11 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
12 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
13 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
14 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been
15 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
16 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
17 account of overpayment.
18 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
19 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
20 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
21 dollars.
22 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
23 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
24 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
25 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
26 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
27 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
28 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
29 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
30 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
31 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
-60-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
2 determination.
3 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
4 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
5 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
6 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided
7 in section 77-27,127.
8 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
9 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
10 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
11 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
12 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
13 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
14 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is
15 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
16 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
17 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
18 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
19 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
20 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
21 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
22 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
23 filed.
24 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
25 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
26 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
27 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
28 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
29 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
30 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
31 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
-61-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
2 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
3 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
4 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
5 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
6 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
7 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
8 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
9 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
10 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
11 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
12 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
13 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
14 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income
15 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
16 return.
17 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
18 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
19 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
20 which the collection is made.
21 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
22 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
23 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
24 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
25 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.
26 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
27 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
28 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
29 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
30 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
31 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
-62-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
2 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
3 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
4 other charges.
5 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
6 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
7 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
8 the state shall permit the allocation.
9 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
10 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
11 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
12 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
13 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
14 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
15 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
16 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
17 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
18 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
19 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
20 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
21 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
22 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
23 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
24 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
25 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of
26 section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable. This subsection shall not
27 apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision (2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii)
28 or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
29 Sec. 40. Section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
30 2024, is amended to read:
31 77-2711 (1)(a) The Tax Commissioner shall enforce sections
-63-

1 77-2701.04 to 77-2713 and may prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and
2 regulations relating to the administration and enforcement of such
3 sections.
4 (b) The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the extent to which any
5 ruling or regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.
6 (2) The Tax Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors,
7 investigators, assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient
8 administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and may delegate
9 authority to his or her representatives to conduct hearings, prescribe
10 regulations, or perform any other duties imposed by such act.
11 (3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing,
12 using, or otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a
13 retailer shall keep such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent
14 papers in such form as the Tax Commissioner may reasonably require.
15 (b) Every such seller, retailer, or person shall keep such records
16 for not less than three years from the making of such records unless the
17 Tax Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
18 (4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him
19 or her may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any
20 person selling property and any person liable for the use tax and may
21 investigate the character of the business of the person in order to
22 verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the
23 person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the
24 examination of any person selling property or of any person liable for
25 the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as to the accuracy of the reporting
26 of city and county sales and use taxes for which the person is liable
27 under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections 13-319, 13-324, 13-2813,
28 and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made between the various
29 counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the tax due. The
30 Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
31 exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person

2 (5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her
3 records at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records
4 available to the Tax Commissioner at all times.

6 require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in
7 his, her, or their possession or custody information relating to sales of
8 property, the storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to
9 the tax. The report shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and
10 shall set forth the names and addresses of purchasers of the property,
11 the sales price of the property, the date of sale, and such other
12 information as the Tax Commissioner may require.
13 (7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner or
14 any official or employee of the Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, or
15 the Department of Administrative Services to make known in any manner
16 whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an
17 investigation of records and activities of any retailer or any other
18 person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty or the
19 amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any
20 particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any return, or to permit
21 any return or copy thereof, or any book containing any abstract or
22 particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person not connected
23 with the Tax Commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
24 prohibit (a) the delivery to a taxpayer, his or her duly authorized
25 representative, or his or her successors, receivers, trustees, executors,
26 administrators, assignees, or guarantors, if directly interested, of a

27 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
28 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
29 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only

10 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified

12 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable

16 and
17 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
18 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
19 unauthorized access and disclosure.
20 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
21 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
22 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
23 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
24 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
25 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
26 longer be retained by the member states.
27 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
28 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
29 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
30 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
31 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
-72-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
2 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought

4 such request.

6 General.

1 credits which appear on property tax statements. Property tax credits
2 granted under the act shall be credited against the amount of property
3 taxes owed to school districts.
4 (2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each
5 parcel, the county treasurer shall multiply the amount disbursed to the
6 county under subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school
7 district taxes levied in the prior year on the parcel to the school
8 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
9 county. The amount so determined shall be the property tax credit for
10 that parcel.
11 (3) If the real property owner qualifies for a homestead exemption

18 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
19 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall
20 immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection to the School

31 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the

4 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
5 the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on or before
6 January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
7 (5) The county treasurer shall disburse amounts received under
8 subsection (4) of this section, which are credited against the amount of
9 property taxes owed to school districts, in the same manner as if such
10 funds had been received in the form of property tax payments for property
11 taxes owed to school districts, meaning any amounts attributable to
12 divided taxes pursuant to section 18-2147 of the Community Development
13 Law shall be remitted to the applicable authority for which such taxes
