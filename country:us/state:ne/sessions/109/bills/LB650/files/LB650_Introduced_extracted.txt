2025 2025

2 time the gross receipts are realized under the accounting basis used by
3 the retailer to maintain his or her books and records.

5 retailer from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase
6 price and until collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the
7 retailer and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other
8 debts. The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the consumer
9 constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this state.
10 (b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state

10 sale of property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the

12 to the effect that the property is purchased for the purpose of
13 reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an exemption certificate pursuant

15 pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of a resale
16 certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
17 conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was
18 exempt or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
19 (g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
20 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle
21 Registration Act, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental
22 or lease price, except as otherwise provided within this section.
23 (h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
24 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of
25 one year or more, the lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales
26 tax on the gross receipts and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such
27 vehicle. If such election is made, it shall be made pursuant to the
28 following conditions:
29 (i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with
30 the Tax Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax
31 Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all

1 conditions of this subsection and all rules and regulations of the Tax
2 Commissioner;
3 (ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for
4 a period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the
5 lessor elects to terminate the election;
6 (iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of
7 the lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except
8 vehicles to be leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the
9 lessor a valid common or contract carrier exemption certificate. If the
10 lessor rents or leases other vehicles for periods of less than one year,
11 such lessor shall maintain his or her books and records and his or her
12 accounting procedure as the Tax Commissioner prescribes; and
13 (iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the
14 contents and form of the notice of election, a procedure for the
15 determination of the tax base of vehicles which are under an existing
16 lease at the time such election becomes effective, the method and manner
17 for terminating such election, and such other rules and regulations as
18 may be necessary for the proper administration of this subdivision.

4 furnish such certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
5 shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than
6 twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser
7 does not register such motorboat within thirty days of the purchase
8 thereof, the tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter be
9 paid by the purchaser to the county treasurer. If the tax is not paid on
10 or before the thirtieth day after its purchase, the county treasurer
11 shall also collect from the purchaser interest from the thirtieth day
12 through the date of payment and sales tax penalties as provided in the
13 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The county treasurer shall report and remit
14 the tax so collected to the Tax Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the
15 following month. The county treasurer, for his or her collection fee,
16 shall deduct and withhold for the use of the county general fund, from
17 all amounts required to be collected under this subsection, the
18 collection fee permitted to be deducted by any retailer collecting the
19 sales tax. The collection fee shall be forfeited if the county treasurer
20 violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the collection of the use
21 tax.
22 (ii) In the rental or lease of motorboats, the tax shall be
23 collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price.
24 (k)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of an all-terrain
25 vehicle as defined in section 60-103 or a utility-type vehicle as defined
26 in section 60-135.01 shall be the liability of the purchaser. The tax
27 shall be collected by the county treasurer or by an approved licensed
28 dealer participating in the electronic dealer services system pursuant to
29 section 60-1507 at the time the purchaser makes application for the
30 certificate of title for the all-terrain vehicle or utility-type vehicle.
31 At the time of the sale of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-type
-15-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 vehicle, the seller shall (A) state on the sales invoice the dollar
2 amount of the tax imposed under this section and (B) furnish to the
3 purchaser a certified statement of the transaction, in such form as the
4 Tax Commissioner prescribes, setting forth as a minimum the total sales
5 price, the allowance for any trade-in, and the difference between the
6 two. The sales tax due shall be computed on the difference between the
7 total sales price and the allowance for any trade-in as disclosed by such
8 certified statement. Any seller who willfully understates the amount upon
9 which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one thousand
10 dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to
11 the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such
12 certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon
13 conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five
14 dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not
15 obtain a certificate of title for such all-terrain vehicle or utility-
16 type vehicle within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed
17 by this section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to
18 the county treasurer. If the tax is not paid on or before the thirtieth
19 day after its purchase, the county treasurer shall also collect from the
20 purchaser interest from the thirtieth day through the date of payment and
21 sales tax penalties as provided in the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The
22 county treasurer shall report and remit the tax so collected to the Tax
23 Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month. The county
24 treasurer, for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold for
25 the use of the county general fund, from all amounts required to be
26 collected under this subsection, the collection fee permitted to be
27 deducted by any retailer collecting the sales tax. The collection fee
28 shall be forfeited if the county treasurer violates any rule or
29 regulation pertaining to the collection of the use tax.
30 (ii) In the rental or lease of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-
31 type vehicle, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or
-16-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 lease price.
2 (iii) County treasurers are appointed as sales and use tax
3 collectors for all sales of all-terrain vehicles or utility-type vehicles
4 made outside of this state to purchasers or users of all-terrain vehicles
5 or utility-type vehicles which are required to have a certificate of
6 title in this state. The county treasurer shall collect the applicable
7 use tax from the purchaser of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-type
8 vehicle purchased outside of this state at the time application for a
9 certificate of title is made. The full use tax on the purchase price
10 shall be collected by the county treasurer if a sales or occupation tax
11 was not paid by the purchaser in the state of purchase. If a sales or
12 occupation tax was lawfully paid in the state of purchase at a rate less
13 than the tax imposed in this state, use tax must be collected on the
14 difference as a condition for obtaining a certificate of title in this
15 state.
16 (l) The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules
17 and regulations for determining the amount subject to the taxes imposed
18 by this section so as to insure that the full amount of any applicable
19 tax is paid in cases in which a sale is made of which a part is subject
20 to the taxes imposed by this section and a part of which is not so
21 subject and a separate accounting is not practical or economical.
22 (2) A use tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other
23 consumption in this state of property purchased, leased, or rented from
24 any retailer and on any transaction the gross receipts of which are
25 subject to tax under subsection (1) of this section on or after June 1,
26 1967, for storage, use, or other consumption in this state at the rate
27 set as provided in subsection (1) of this section on the sales price of
28 the property or, in the case of leases or rentals, of the lease or rental
29 prices.
30 (a) Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this
31 state property purchased from a retailer or leased or rented from another
-17-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 person for such purpose shall be liable for the use tax at the rate in
2 effect when his or her liability for the use tax becomes certain under
3 the accounting basis used to maintain his or her books and records. His
4 or her liability shall not be extinguished until the use tax has been
5 paid to this state, except that a receipt from a retailer engaged in
6 business in this state or from a retailer who is authorized by the Tax
7 Commissioner, under such rules and regulations as he or she may
8 prescribe, to collect the sales tax and who is, for the purposes of the
9 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 relating to the sales tax, regarded as a
10 retailer engaged in business in this state, which receipt is given to the
11 purchaser pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be
12 sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to
13 which the receipt refers.
14 (b) Every retailer engaged in business in this state and selling,
15 leasing, or renting property for storage, use, or other consumption in
16 this state shall, at the time of making any sale, collect any tax which
17 may be due from the purchaser and shall give to the purchaser, upon
18 request, a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Tax
19 Commissioner.
20 (c) The Tax Commissioner, in order to facilitate the proper
21 administration of the use tax, may designate such person or persons as he
22 or she may deem necessary to be use tax collectors and delegate to such
23 persons such authority as is necessary to collect any use tax which is
24 due and payable to the State of Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner may
25 require of all persons so designated a surety bond in favor of the State
26 of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of state funds so
27 collected. The Tax Commissioner may require any tax official, city,
28 county, or state, to collect the use tax on behalf of the state. All
29 persons designated to or required to collect the use tax shall account
30 for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
31 Nothing in this subdivision shall be so construed as to prevent the Tax
-18-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 Commissioner or his or her employees from collecting any use taxes due
2 and payable to the State of Nebraska.
3 (d) All persons designated to collect the use tax and all persons
4 required to collect the use tax shall forward the total of such
5 collections to the Tax Commissioner at such time and in such manner as
6 the Tax Commissioner may prescribe. Such collectors of the use tax shall
7 deduct and withhold from the amount of taxes collected two and one-half
8 three percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each
9 month as reimbursement for the cost of collecting the tax. Any such
10 deduction shall be forfeited to the State of Nebraska if such collector
11 violates any rule, regulation, or directive of the Tax Commissioner.
12 (e) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
13 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, it shall be
14 presumed that property sold, leased, or rented by any person for delivery
15 in this state is sold, leased, or rented for storage, use, or other
16 consumption in this state until the contrary is established. The burden
17 of proving the contrary is upon the person who purchases, leases, or
18 rents the property.
19 (f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
20 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, for the sale
21 of property to an advertising agency which purchases the property as an
22 agent for a disclosed or undisclosed principal, the advertising agency is
23 and remains liable for the sales and use tax on the purchase the same as
24 if the principal had made the purchase directly.
25 Sec. 6. Section 77-2704.36, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
26 2024, is amended to read:
27 77-2704.36 (1) Sales and use tax shall not be imposed on the gross
28 receipts from the sale, lease, or rental of:

-19-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 (b) Baling Net wrap, baling wire , and twine purchased for use in
2 commercial agriculture.
3 (2) For purposes of this section:

7 welfare of animal life, including fans, curtains, and climate control
8 equipment within livestock buildings, or (D) collecting or processing an
9 agricultural product on a farm or ranch, regardless of the degree of
10 attachment to any real property; and
11 (ii) Agricultural machinery and equipment includes, but is not
12 limited to, header trailers, head haulers, header transports, and seed
13 tender trailers and excludes any current tractor model as defined in

19 or bedding; and
20 (d) Twine means a strong string of two or more strands twisted
21 together used in the baling of livestock feed or bedding.
22 Sec. 7. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
23 2024, is amended to read:
24 77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska
25 Revenue Act of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner
26 monthly on or before the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each
27 monthly period unless otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
28 Act of 1967.
29 (b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each
30 monthly period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require,
31 a return for such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with
-20-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 the Tax Commissioner in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may
2 prescribe and containing such information as the Tax Commissioner deems
3 necessary for the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of
4 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he or she deems it necessary in order to
5 insure payment to or facilitate the collection by the state of the amount
6 of sales or use taxes due, may require returns and payment of the amount
7 of such taxes for periods other than monthly periods in the case of a
8 particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case may be. The Tax
9 Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and tax
10 payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
11 tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
12 agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers',
13 or purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars,
14 quarterly returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine
15 hundred dollars or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly
16 returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand
17 dollars or more. The Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow
18 an annual return for seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax
19 liability exceeds the amounts listed in this subdivision.
20 The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
21 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
22 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
23 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
24 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
25 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
26 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
27 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
28 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
29 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
30 amount shall be imposed.
31 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
-21-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
2 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
3 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
4 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
5 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use
6 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
7 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
8 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
9 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
10 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
11 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
12 but need not be verified by oath.
13 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
14 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
15 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
16 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
17 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
18 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
19 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
20 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
21 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
22 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
23 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
24 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
25 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
26 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
27 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
28 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
29 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
30 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
31 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
-22-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
2 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
3 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
4 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
5 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the
6 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
7 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
8 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
9 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
10 notified the Tax Commissioner.
11 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
12 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
13 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
14 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
15 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
16 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
17 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
18 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
19 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
20 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
21 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
22 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
23 penalty shall be five dollars.
24 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
25 due from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three
26 percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to
27 reimburse himself or herself for the cost of collecting the tax.
28 Taxpayers filing a combined return as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii)
29 of this subsection shall compute such collection fees on the basis of the
30 receipts and liability of each licensed location.
31 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
-23-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
2 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
3 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
4 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
5 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
6 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
7 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
8 provided in section 77-2704.35.
9 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
10 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
11 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
12 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
13 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
14 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
15 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
16 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
17 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
18 marketplace platform operator.
19 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
20 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
21 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
22 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
23 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
24 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
25 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
26 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
27 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
28 executors.
29 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
30 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
31 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
-24-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
2 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
3 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
4 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
5 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been
6 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
7 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
8 account of overpayment.
9 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
10 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
11 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
12 dollars.
13 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
14 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
15 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
16 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
17 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
18 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
19 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
20 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
21 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
22 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
23 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
24 determination.
25 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
26 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
27 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
28 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided
29 in section 77-27,127.
30 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
31 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
-25-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
2 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
3 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
4 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
5 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is
6 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
7 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
8 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
9 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
10 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
11 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
12 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
13 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
14 filed.
15 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
16 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
17 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
18 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
19 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
20 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
21 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
22 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
23 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
24 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
25 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
26 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
27 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
28 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
29 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
30 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
31 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
-26-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
2 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
3 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
4 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
5 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income
6 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
7 return.
8 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
9 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
10 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
11 which the collection is made.
12 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
13 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
14 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
15 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
16 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.
17 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
18 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
19 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
20 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
21 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
22 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
23 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
24 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
25 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
26 other charges.
27 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
28 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
29 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
30 the state shall permit the allocation.
31 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
-27-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
2 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
3 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
4 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
5 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
6 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
7 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
8 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
9 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
10 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
11 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
12 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
13 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
14 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
15 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
16 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of
17 section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable. This subsection shall not
18 apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision (2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii)
19 or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
20 Sec. 8. Section 77-2715.07, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
21 2024, is amended to read:
22 77-2715.07 (1) There shall be allowed to qualified resident
23 individuals as a nonrefundable credit against the income tax imposed by
24 the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967:

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 there is a sale, the tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the
2 time the gross receipts are realized under the accounting basis used by
3 the retailer to maintain his or her books and records.
4 (a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the
5 retailer from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase
6 price and until collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the
7 retailer and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other
8 debts. The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the consumer
9 constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this state.
10 (b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state
11 to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or
12 part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will
13 not be added to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property
14 sold, rented, or leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will
15 be refunded. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a

21 price on the sales check or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.
22 (d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment,
23 collection, and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of
24 the retailer in collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax
25 Commissioner to provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be
26 collected from the consumer or user to effectuate the computation and
27 collection of the tax imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such
28 schedule or schedules shall provide that the tax shall be collected from
29 the consumer or user uniformly on sales according to brackets based on
30 sales prices of the item or items. Retailers may compute the tax due on
31 any transaction on an item or an invoice basis. The rounding rule

1 provided in section 77-3,117 applies.
2 (e) The use of tokens or stamps for the purpose of collecting or
3 enforcing the collection of the taxes imposed in the Nebraska Revenue Act
4 of 1967 or for any other purpose in connection with such taxes is
5 prohibited.
6 (f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions
7 of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the retail
8 sales tax, it shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to
9 the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a
10 sale of property is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the
11 sale unless he or she takes from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate
12 to the effect that the property is purchased for the purpose of
13 reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an exemption certificate pursuant
14 to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a direct payment permit
15 pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of a resale
16 certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
17 conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was
18 exempt or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
19 (g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
20 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle
21 Registration Act, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental
22 or lease price, except as otherwise provided within this section.
23 (h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers,
24 semitrailers, and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of
25 one year or more, the lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales
26 tax on the gross receipts and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such
27 vehicle. If such election is made, it shall be made pursuant to the
28 following conditions:
29 (i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with
30 the Tax Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax
31 Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all
-11-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 conditions of this subsection and all rules and regulations of the Tax
2 Commissioner;
3 (ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for
4 a period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the
5 lessor elects to terminate the election;
6 (iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of

17 register such motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation on the
18 highways of this state within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the
19 tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the
20 purchaser to the county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles. If

23 collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price.
24 (k)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of an all-terrain
25 vehicle as defined in section 60-103 or a utility-type vehicle as defined

28 dealer participating in the electronic dealer services system pursuant to

31 At the time of the sale of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-type
-15-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 vehicle, the seller shall (A) state on the sales invoice the dollar
2 amount of the tax imposed under this section and (B) furnish to the
3 purchaser a certified statement of the transaction, in such form as the
4 Tax Commissioner prescribes, setting forth as a minimum the total sales

10 dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to
11 the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such
12 certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon
13 conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five
14 dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not
15 obtain a certificate of title for such all-terrain vehicle or utility-
16 type vehicle within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed
17 by this section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to
18 the county treasurer. If the tax is not paid on or before the thirtieth

28 shall be forfeited if the county treasurer violates any rule or
29 regulation pertaining to the collection of the use tax.
30 (ii) In the rental or lease of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-
31 type vehicle, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or
-16-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 lease price.
2 (iii) County treasurers are appointed as sales and use tax
3 collectors for all sales of all-terrain vehicles or utility-type vehicles
4 made outside of this state to purchasers or users of all-terrain vehicles
5 or utility-type vehicles which are required to have a certificate of
6 title in this state. The county treasurer shall collect the applicable
7 use tax from the purchaser of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-type
8 vehicle purchased outside of this state at the time application for a
9 certificate of title is made. The full use tax on the purchase price
10 shall be collected by the county treasurer if a sales or occupation tax
11 was not paid by the purchaser in the state of purchase. If a sales or
12 occupation tax was lawfully paid in the state of purchase at a rate less
13 than the tax imposed in this state, use tax must be collected on the
14 difference as a condition for obtaining a certificate of title in this
15 state.
16 (l) The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules
17 and regulations for determining the amount subject to the taxes imposed
18 by this section so as to insure that the full amount of any applicable
19 tax is paid in cases in which a sale is made of which a part is subject
20 to the taxes imposed by this section and a part of which is not so
21 subject and a separate accounting is not practical or economical.
22 (2) A use tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other
23 consumption in this state of property purchased, leased, or rented from
24 any retailer and on any transaction the gross receipts of which are
25 subject to tax under subsection (1) of this section on or after June 1,
26 1967, for storage, use, or other consumption in this state at the rate
27 set as provided in subsection (1) of this section on the sales price of
28 the property or, in the case of leases or rentals, of the lease or rental
29 prices.
30 (a) Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this
31 state property purchased from a retailer or leased or rented from another
-17-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 person for such purpose shall be liable for the use tax at the rate in
2 effect when his or her liability for the use tax becomes certain under
3 the accounting basis used to maintain his or her books and records. His
4 or her liability shall not be extinguished until the use tax has been
5 paid to this state, except that a receipt from a retailer engaged in
6 business in this state or from a retailer who is authorized by the Tax
7 Commissioner, under such rules and regulations as he or she may
8 prescribe, to collect the sales tax and who is, for the purposes of the
9 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 relating to the sales tax, regarded as a
10 retailer engaged in business in this state, which receipt is given to the
11 purchaser pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be
12 sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to
13 which the receipt refers.
14 (b) Every retailer engaged in business in this state and selling,
15 leasing, or renting property for storage, use, or other consumption in
16 this state shall, at the time of making any sale, collect any tax which
17 may be due from the purchaser and shall give to the purchaser, upon
18 request, a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Tax
19 Commissioner.
20 (c) The Tax Commissioner, in order to facilitate the proper
21 administration of the use tax, may designate such person or persons as he
22 or she may deem necessary to be use tax collectors and delegate to such
23 persons such authority as is necessary to collect any use tax which is
24 due and payable to the State of Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner may
25 require of all persons so designated a surety bond in favor of the State
26 of Nebraska to insure against any misappropriation of state funds so
27 collected. The Tax Commissioner may require any tax official, city,
28 county, or state, to collect the use tax on behalf of the state. All
29 persons designated to or required to collect the use tax shall account
30 for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
31 Nothing in this subdivision shall be so construed as to prevent the Tax
-18-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 Commissioner or his or her employees from collecting any use taxes due
2 and payable to the State of Nebraska.
3 (d) All persons designated to collect the use tax and all persons
4 required to collect the use tax shall forward the total of such
5 collections to the Tax Commissioner at such time and in such manner as
6 the Tax Commissioner may prescribe. Such collectors of the use tax shall
7 deduct and withhold from the amount of taxes collected two and one-half
8 three percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each
9 month as reimbursement for the cost of collecting the tax. Any such
10 deduction shall be forfeited to the State of Nebraska if such collector
11 violates any rule, regulation, or directive of the Tax Commissioner.
12 (e) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
13 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, it shall be
14 presumed that property sold, leased, or rented by any person for delivery
15 in this state is sold, leased, or rented for storage, use, or other
16 consumption in this state until the contrary is established. The burden
17 of proving the contrary is upon the person who purchases, leases, or
18 rents the property.
19 (f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska
20 Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, for the sale
21 of property to an advertising agency which purchases the property as an
22 agent for a disclosed or undisclosed principal, the advertising agency is
23 and remains liable for the sales and use tax on the purchase the same as
24 if the principal had made the purchase directly.

26 2024, is amended to read:
27 77-2704.36 (1) Sales and use tax shall not be imposed on the gross

22 Sec. 7. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
23 2024, is amended to read:
24 77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska
25 Revenue Act of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner
26 monthly on or before the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each
27 monthly period unless otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
28 Act of 1967.
29 (b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each
30 monthly period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require,
31 a return for such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with
-20-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 the Tax Commissioner in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may
2 prescribe and containing such information as the Tax Commissioner deems
3 necessary for the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of
4 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he or she deems it necessary in order to
5 insure payment to or facilitate the collection by the state of the amount
6 of sales or use taxes due, may require returns and payment of the amount
7 of such taxes for periods other than monthly periods in the case of a
8 particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case may be. The Tax
9 Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and tax
10 payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
11 tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
12 agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers',
13 or purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars,
14 quarterly returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine
15 hundred dollars or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly
16 returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand
17 dollars or more. The Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow
18 an annual return for seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax
19 liability exceeds the amounts listed in this subdivision.
20 The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
21 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
22 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
23 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
24 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
25 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
26 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
27 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
28 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
29 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
30 amount shall be imposed.
31 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
-21-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
2 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
3 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
4 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
5 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use
6 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
7 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
8 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
9 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
10 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
11 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
12 but need not be verified by oath.
13 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
14 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
15 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
16 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
17 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
18 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
19 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
20 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
21 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
22 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
23 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
24 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
25 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
26 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
27 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
28 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
29 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
30 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
31 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
-22-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
2 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
3 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
4 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
5 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the
6 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
7 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
8 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
9 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
10 notified the Tax Commissioner.
11 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
12 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
13 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
14 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
15 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
16 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
17 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
18 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
19 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
20 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
21 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
22 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
23 penalty shall be five dollars.
24 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
25 due from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three
26 percent of the first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to
27 reimburse himself or herself for the cost of collecting the tax.
28 Taxpayers filing a combined return as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii)
29 of this subsection shall compute such collection fees on the basis of the
30 receipts and liability of each licensed location.
31 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
-23-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
2 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
3 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
4 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
5 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
6 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
7 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
8 provided in section 77-2704.35.
9 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
10 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
11 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
12 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
13 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
14 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
15 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
16 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
17 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
18 marketplace platform operator.
19 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
20 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
21 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
22 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
23 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
24 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
25 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
26 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
27 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
28 executors.
29 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
30 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
31 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
-24-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
2 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
3 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
4 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
5 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been
6 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
7 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
8 account of overpayment.
9 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
10 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
11 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
12 dollars.
13 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
14 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
15 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
16 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
17 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
18 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
19 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
20 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
21 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
22 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
23 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
24 determination.
25 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
26 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
27 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
28 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided

30 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
31 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
-25-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
2 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
3 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
4 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
5 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is
6 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
7 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
8 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
9 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
10 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
11 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
12 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
13 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
14 filed.
15 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
16 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
17 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
18 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
19 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
20 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
21 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
22 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
23 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
24 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
25 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
26 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
27 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
28 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
29 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
30 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
31 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
-26-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
2 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
3 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
4 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
5 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income
6 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
7 return.
8 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
9 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
10 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
11 which the collection is made.
12 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
13 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
14 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
15 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
16 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.
17 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
18 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
19 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
20 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
21 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
22 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
23 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
24 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
25 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
26 other charges.
27 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
28 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
29 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
30 the state shall permit the allocation.
31 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
-27-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
1 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
2 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
3 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
4 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
5 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
6 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
7 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
8 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
9 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
10 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
11 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
12 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
13 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
14 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
15 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
16 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of
17 section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable. This subsection shall not
18 apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision (2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii)
19 or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.

28 that were necessary for the original establishment of such good life
29 district.
30 (9) After establishment of a good life district pursuant to this
31 section and after any modification is made to the boundaries of a good
-80-

1 life district pursuant to this section, the department shall transmit to
2 any city or village which includes such good life district within its
3 boundaries or within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction (a) all
4 information held by the department related to the application and
5 approval of the application, (b) all documentation which describes the
6 property included within the good life district, and (c) all
7 documentation transmitted to the applicant for such good life district
8 with approval of the application and establishment of the good life
9 district. Such city or village shall be subject to the same
10 confidentiality restrictions as provided in subsection (3) of section
11 77-4404, except that all such documents, plans, and specifications
12 included in the application which the city or village determine define or

15 (10) After establishment of a good life district that exceeds one
16 thousand acres in size, the good life district applicant may apply to the
17 department to establish development and design standards for the good
18 life district. Such standards may include, but are not limited to,
19 standards for architectural design, landscape design, construction
20 materials, and sustainability, but may not require property owners to
21 utilize specific contractors, professionals, suppliers, or service
22 providers. The department may approve the standards after holding a
23 hearing after one hundred eighty days' notice to all property owners in
24 the district if the department finds that the standards will ensure a
25 comprehensive and cohesive character and aesthetic for development in the
26 good life district, and that the standards will further the purposes of
27 the Good Life Transformational Projects Act. The development and design
28 standards must be commercially reasonable and consistent with terminology
29 and accepted practices in the architecture industry, must not conflict
30 with any building code or other similar law or regulation, and must not
31 impose an undue burden on property owners in the district. If approved,

4 zoning, building code, comprehensive plan, or similar requirements of the
5 city or village, which requirements of the city or village shall control
6 to the extent of any conflict with any design standards established by
7 the department.
8 (11) Demonstration of meeting the required new development costs for
9 purposes of subdivision (2)(a) of this section may be established by
10 evidence submitted by the good life district applicant, the city or
11 village where the good life district is located, or any other person
12 which submits satisfactory evidence to the department.
