conclusive proof that such real estate is vacant and abandoned. If the real
estate is not registered as vacant and abandoned pursuant to such an ordinance,
the purchaser or assignee shall not be obligated to proceed under subdivision

shall be equal to the amount received from such sale, minus (i) the amount that
would have been needed to redeem such property, (ii) the amount needed to pay
all encumbrances on such property, and (iii) an administrative fee of five
hundred dollars or reasonable attorney's fees in the event of judicial
foreclosure, which may be retained by the grantee to offset the costs incurred

surplus shall be equal to the assessed value of such property as reflected in
the records of the county assessor at the time of the application for the tax
deed, minus (i) the amount that would have been needed to redeem such property,

which the real property was sold. It is made the duty of each and every county
treasurer of the State of Nebraska to enter on the tax sale records of his or
her office a cancellation of all tax sales on which the time specified in

issued, by surrendering the same in court, proceed in the district court of the
county in which the land is situated to foreclose the lien for taxes
represented by the tax sale certificate or tax deed and all subsequent tax
liens thereon, excluding any lien on real estate for special assessments levied
by any sanitary and improvement district which special assessments have not
been previously offered for sale by the county treasurer, in the same manner

otherwise specifically provided by sections 77-1903 to 77-1917.

nine months after the expiration of three years from the date of sale of the
any real estate for taxes or special assessments.

the sale of such real estate for taxes or special assessments.
(c) If the real estate is registered as vacant and abandoned pursuant to a
vacant property registration ordinance adopted by a municipality, it shall be
conclusive proof that such real estate is vacant and abandoned. If the real
estate is not registered as vacant and abandoned pursuant to such an ordinance,
the holder of the tax sale certificate or tax deed shall not be obligated to
proceed under subdivision (2)(a) of this section, but may instead choose to
proceed under subdivision (2)(b) of this section, and no deed subsequently
issued to such holder shall be deemed invalid due to noncompliance with

estate should it be determined that such real estate is not vacant and
abandoned.
(d) If the holder of the tax sale certificate or tax deed determines real
estate to be vacant and abandoned pursuant to this subsection, the holder shall
submit an affidavit to the county treasurer affirming that the real estate is
vacant and abandoned.
Sec. 35. Section 77-1909, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:

special assessments have not been previously offered for sale by the county
treasurer, and award to the plaintiff an attorney's fee, unless waived by the
plaintiff, in an amount equal to ten percent of the amount due plus, for good
cause shown, reasonable attorney's fees in excess of the ten percent, which
shall be taxed as part of the costs in the action and apportioned equitably as
other costs.

Sec. 37. Section 77-2703, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2703 (1) There is hereby imposed a tax at the rate provided in section
77-2701.02 upon the gross receipts from all sales of tangible personal property
sold at retail in this state; the gross receipts of every person engaged as a
public utility, as a community antenna television service operator, or as a
satellite service operator, any person involved in the connecting and
installing of the services defined in subdivision (2)(a), (b), (d), or (e) of

Section 15:
section 77-2701.16, or every person engaged as a retailer of intellectual or
entertainment properties referred to in subsection (3) of section 77-2701.16;
the gross receipts from the sale of admissions in this state; the gross
receipts from the sale of warranties, guarantees, service agreements, or
maintenance agreements when the items covered are subject to tax under this

Section 16:
section; beginning January 1, 2008, the gross receipts from the sale of bundled
transactions when one or more of the products included in the bundle are
taxable; the gross receipts from the provision of services defined in
subsection (4) of section 77-2701.16; and the gross receipts from the sale of
products delivered electronically as described in subsection (9) of section
77-2701.16. Except as provided in section 77-2701.03, when there is a sale, the
tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the time the gross receipts are
realized under the accounting basis used by the retailer to maintain his or her
books and records.
(a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the retailer
from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase price and until
collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the retailer and shall be
recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts. The tax required to be
collected by the retailer from the consumer constitutes a debt owed by the
retailer to this state.
(b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state to
the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or part
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will not be added
to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property sold, rented, or
leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will be refunded. The
provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a public utility.
(c) The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the purchaser,
unless otherwise provided by statute or by rule and regulation of the Tax
Commissioner, shall be displayed separately from the list price, the price
advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other price on the sales check
or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.
(d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment, collection,
and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of the retailer in
collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to
provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be collected from the
consumer or user to effectuate the computation and collection of the tax
imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such schedule or schedules shall
provide that the tax shall be collected from the consumer or user uniformly on
sales according to brackets based on sales prices of the item or items.
Retailers may compute the tax due on any transaction on an item or an invoice
basis. The rounding rule provided in section 77-3,117 applies.
(e) The use of tokens or stamps for the purpose of collecting or enforcing
the collection of the taxes imposed in the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 or for
any other purpose in connection with such taxes is prohibited.
(f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions of the
Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the retail sales tax, it
shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to the tax until the
contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale of property is not a
sale at retail is upon the person who makes the sale unless he or she takes
from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate to the effect that the property is
purchased for the purpose of reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an
exemption certificate pursuant to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a
direct payment permit pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of
a resale certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was exempt
or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
(g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers,
and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, the tax
shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price, except as
otherwise provided within this section.
(h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers,
and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of one year or more, the
lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales tax on the gross receipts
and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such vehicle. If such election is
made, it shall be made pursuant to the following conditions:
(i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with the Tax
Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax Commissioner is
satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all conditions of this subsection
and all rules and regulations of the Tax Commissioner;
(ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for a
period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the lessor
elects to terminate the election;
(iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of the
lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except vehicles to be
-16-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the lessor a valid common
or contract carrier exemption certificate. If the lessor rents or leases other
vehicles for periods of less than one year, such lessor shall maintain his or
her books and records and his or her accounting procedure as the Tax
Commissioner prescribes; and
(iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the
contents and form of the notice of election, a procedure for the determination
of the tax base of vehicles which are under an existing lease at the time such
election becomes effective, the method and manner for terminating such
election, and such other rules and regulations as may be necessary for the
proper administration of this subdivision.
(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sales of motor vehicles,

the tax shall be collected by the county treasurer as provided in the Motor
Vehicle Registration Act or by an approved licensed dealer participating in the
electronic dealer services system pursuant to section 60-1507 at the time the
purchaser makes application for the registration of the motor vehicle,
semitrailer, or trailer for operation upon the highways of this state. The tax
imposed by this section on motor vehicles, semitrailers, and trailers
registered pursuant to section 60-3,198 shall be collected by the Department of
Motor Vehicles at the time the purchaser makes application for the registration
of the motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation upon the highways
of this state. At the time of the sale of any motor vehicle, semitrailer, or
trailer, the seller shall (i) state on the sales invoice the dollar amount of
the tax imposed under this section and (ii) furnish to the purchaser a
certified statement of the transaction, in such form as the Tax Commissioner
prescribes, setting forth as a minimum the total sales price, the allowance for
any trade-in, and the difference between the two. The sales tax due shall be
computed on the difference between the total sales price and the allowance for
any trade-in as disclosed by such certified statement. Any seller who willfully
understates the amount upon which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a
penalty of one thousand dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also
be furnished to the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to
furnish such certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall,
upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five
dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not register
such motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation on the highways of
this state within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed by this

Section 17:
section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to the county
treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles. If the tax is not paid on or
before the thirtieth day after its purchase, the county treasurer or Department
of Motor Vehicles shall also collect from the purchaser interest from the
thirtieth day through the date of payment and sales tax penalties as provided
in the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The county treasurer or Department of
Motor Vehicles shall report and remit the tax so collected to the Tax
Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month. The county treasurer,
for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold, from all amounts
required to be collected under this subsection, the collection fee permitted to
be deducted by any retailer collecting the sales tax, all of which shall be
deposited in the county general fund, plus an additional amount equal to one-
half of one percent of all amounts in excess of six thousand dollars remitted
each month. Prior to January 1, 2023, fifty percent of such additional amount
shall be deposited in the county general fund and fifty percent of such
additional amount shall be deposited in the county road fund. On and after
January 1, 2023, seventy-five percent of such additional amount shall be
deposited in the county general fund and twenty-five percent of such additional
amount shall be deposited in the county road fund. In any county with a
population of one hundred fifty thousand inhabitants or more, the county
treasurer shall remit one dollar of his or her collection fee for each of the
first five thousand motor vehicles, semitrailers, or trailers registered with
such county treasurer on or after January 1, 2020, to the State Treasurer for
credit to the Department of Revenue Enforcement Fund. The Department of Motor
Vehicles, for its collection fee, shall deduct, withhold, and deposit in the
Motor Carrier Division Cash Fund the collection fee permitted to be deducted by
any retailer collecting the sales tax. The collection fee for the county
treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles shall be forfeited if the county
treasurer or department violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the
collection of the use tax.
(j)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of a motorboat as
defined in section 37-1204 shall be the liability of the purchaser. The tax

the tax imposed under this section and (B) furnish to the purchaser a certified
statement of the transaction, in such form as the Tax Commissioner prescribes,
setting forth as a minimum the total sales price, the allowance for any trade-
in, and the difference between the two. The sales tax due shall be computed on
the difference between the total sales price and the allowance for any trade-in
as disclosed by such certified statement. Any seller who willfully understates
the amount upon which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one
thousand dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to
-17-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such certified
statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof,
be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one
hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not register such motorboat within
thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed by this section shall
immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to the county treasurer. If the
tax is not paid on or before the thirtieth day after its purchase, the county
treasurer shall also collect from the purchaser interest from the thirtieth day
through the date of payment and sales tax penalties as provided in the Nebraska
Revenue Act of 1967. The county treasurer shall report and remit the tax so
collected to the Tax Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month.
The county treasurer, for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold
for the use of the county general fund, from all amounts required to be

Section 19:
section and (B) furnish to the purchaser a certified statement of the

purchase thereof, the tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter
be paid by the purchaser to the county treasurer. If the tax is not paid on or
before the thirtieth day after its purchase, the county treasurer shall also
collect from the purchaser interest from the thirtieth day through the date of
payment and sales tax penalties as provided in the Nebraska Revenue Act of

Section 20:
1967. The county treasurer shall report and remit the tax so collected to the
Tax Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month. The county
treasurer, for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold for the use
of the county general fund, from all amounts required to be collected under
this subsection, the collection fee permitted to be deducted by any retailer
collecting the sales tax. The collection fee shall be forfeited if the county
treasurer violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the collection of the
use tax.
(ii) In the rental or lease of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-type
vehicle, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price.
(iii) County treasurers are appointed as sales and use tax collectors for
all sales of all-terrain vehicles or utility-type vehicles made outside of this
state to purchasers or users of all-terrain vehicles or utility-type vehicles
which are required to have a certificate of title in this state. The county
treasurer shall collect the applicable use tax from the purchaser of an all-
terrain vehicle or a utility-type vehicle purchased outside of this state at
the time application for a certificate of title is made. The full use tax on
the purchase price shall be collected by the county treasurer if a sales or
occupation tax was not paid by the purchaser in the state of purchase. If a
sales or occupation tax was lawfully paid in the state of purchase at a rate
less than the tax imposed in this state, use tax must be collected on the
difference as a condition for obtaining a certificate of title in this state.
(l) The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules and
regulations for determining the amount subject to the taxes imposed by this

Section 21:
section so as to insure that the full amount of any applicable tax is paid in
cases in which a sale is made of which a part is subject to the taxes imposed
by this section and a part of which is not so subject and a separate accounting
is not practical or economical.
(2) A use tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption
in this state of property purchased, leased, or rented from any retailer and on
any transaction the gross receipts of which are subject to tax under subsection
(1) of this section on or after June 1, 1967, for storage, use, or other
consumption in this state at the rate set as provided in subsection (1) of this

Section 22:
section on the sales price of the property or, in the case of leases or
rentals, of the lease or rental prices.
(a) Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this state
property purchased from a retailer or leased or rented from another person for
-18-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
such purpose shall be liable for the use tax at the rate in effect when his or
her liability for the use tax becomes certain under the accounting basis used
to maintain his or her books and records. His or her liability shall not be
extinguished until the use tax has been paid to this state, except that a
receipt from a retailer engaged in business in this state or from a retailer
who is authorized by the Tax Commissioner, under such rules and regulations as
he or she may prescribe, to collect the sales tax and who is, for the purposes
of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 relating to the sales tax, regarded as a
retailer engaged in business in this state, which receipt is given to the
purchaser pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be sufficient
to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which the
receipt refers.
(b) Every retailer engaged in business in this state and selling, leasing,
or renting property for storage, use, or other consumption in this state shall,
at the time of making any sale, collect any tax which may be due from the
purchaser and shall give to the purchaser, upon request, a receipt therefor in
the manner and form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
(c) The Tax Commissioner, in order to facilitate the proper administration
of the use tax, may designate such person or persons as he or she may deem
necessary to be use tax collectors and delegate to such persons such authority
as is necessary to collect any use tax which is due and payable to the State of
Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner may require of all persons so designated a
surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure against any
misappropriation of state funds so collected. The Tax Commissioner may require
any tax official, city, county, or state, to collect the use tax on behalf of
the state. All persons designated to or required to collect the use tax shall
account for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
Nothing in this subdivision shall be so construed as to prevent the Tax
Commissioner or his or her employees from collecting any use taxes due and
payable to the State of Nebraska.
(d) All persons designated to collect the use tax and all persons required
to collect the use tax shall forward the total of such collections to the Tax
Commissioner at such time and in such manner as the Tax Commissioner may
prescribe. Such collectors of the use tax shall deduct and withhold from the
amount of taxes collected two and one-half three percent of the first three
five thousand dollars remitted each month as reimbursement for the cost of
collecting the tax. Any such deduction shall be forfeited to the State of
Nebraska if such collector violates any rule, regulation, or directive of the
Tax Commissioner.
(e) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue
Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, it shall be presumed that
property sold, leased, or rented by any person for delivery in this state is
sold, leased, or rented for storage, use, or other consumption in this state
until the contrary is established. The burden of proving the contrary is upon
the person who purchases, leases, or rents the property.
(f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue
Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, for the sale of property to
an advertising agency which purchases the property as an agent for a disclosed
or undisclosed principal, the advertising agency is and remains liable for the
sales and use tax on the purchase the same as if the principal had made the
purchase directly.
Sec. 38. Section 77-2706.02, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
77-2706.02 (1) This section applies on and after July 1, 2026.
(2) The appointment of purchasing agents shall be recognized for the
purpose of permitting a construction contractor to purchase materials tax free
based on the buyer-based exemption of the contractor's client for items that
are physically annexed to the structure and which subsequently belong to the
client who is eligible for the buyer-based exemption. The appointment of
purchasing agents shall be in writing and occur prior to having any buyer-based
tax-exempt items annexed to real estate in the construction, improvement, or
repair. The contractor who has been appointed as a purchasing agent may
purchase the materials tax free or may apply for a refund of or use as a credit
against a future use tax liability the tax paid on inventory items annexed to
real estate in the construction, improvement, or repair of a project that
belongs to the client who is eligible for the buyer-based exemption.
(3) A client described in subsection (2) of this section which enters into
a contract of construction, improvement, or repair with respect to buyer-based
tax-exempt items annexed to real estate without first issuing a purchasing
agent authorization to a construction contractor prior to such items being
annexed to real estate in the project may apply to the Tax Commissioner for a
refund of any sales and use tax paid by the contractor on such items physically
annexed to real estate in the construction, improvement, or repair.
(4) For purposes of this section, client means a nonprofit entity.
Sec. 39. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner monthly on or before
the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each monthly period unless
otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967.
(b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each monthly
period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require, a return for
such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner
-19-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may prescribe and containing
such information as the Tax Commissioner deems necessary for the proper
administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he
or she deems it necessary in order to insure payment to or facilitate the
collection by the state of the amount of sales or use taxes due, may require
returns and payment of the amount of such taxes for periods other than monthly
periods in the case of a particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case
may be. The Tax Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and
tax payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers', or
purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars, quarterly
returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine hundred dollars
or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly returns shall be
required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand dollars or more. The
Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow an annual return for
seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax liability exceeds the amounts
listed in this subdivision.
The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making monthly
remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic funds transfer or
for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to the streamlined sales
and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations may establish a method of
determining the amount of the payment that will result in substantially all of
the tax liability being paid each quarter. At least once each year, the
difference between the amount paid and the amount due shall be reconciled. If
the difference is more than ten percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty
percent of the unpaid amount shall be imposed.
(ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state of the
tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all licensed
locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of this
subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own eighty
percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use tax, a
return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in this state and
by every person who has purchased property, the storage, use, or other
consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has not paid the use
tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
(iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent but
need not be verified by oath.
(iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a cash
basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting basis which
correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the sales and use tax
returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on the same accounting
basis that is used for the regular books and records, except that on credit,
conditional, and installment sales, the retailer who keeps his or her books on
an accrual basis may report such sales on the cash basis and pay the tax upon
the collections made during each month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells,
assigns, or otherwise disposes of an account receivable, he or she shall be
deemed to have received the full balance of the consideration for the original
sale and shall be liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of
the total sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer to a
subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the sales tax on
the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior to the time the
customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary does not obtain a
Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a surety bond in favor of
the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the tax and any interest and penalty
imposed thereon under this section in an amount not less than two times the
amount of tax payable on outstanding accounts receivable held by the subsidiary
as of the end of the prior calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax
permit or a surety bond in accordance with this section shall result in the
payment on the next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously
remitted. When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting
credit, conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having notified
the Tax Commissioner.
(c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail any required return
together with a remittance of the net amount of the tax due to the office of
the Tax Commissioner on or before the required filing date. Failure to file the
return, filing after the required filing date, failure to remit the net amount
of the tax due, or remitting the net amount of the tax due after the required
filing date shall be cause for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten
percent of the amount of tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-
five dollars, whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a county
treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the penalty shall
be five dollars.
(d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise due
from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three percent of the
first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to reimburse himself or
-20-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
herself for the cost of collecting the tax. Taxpayers filing a combined return
as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii) of this subsection shall compute such
collection fees on the basis of the receipts and liability of each licensed
location.
(e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit sales
taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must include all sales into
Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but may claim credit for any
sales taxes collected and remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform with
respect to such retailer's sales. Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due
on sales into Nebraska as provided in section 77-2704.35.
(f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to
collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to Nebraska
to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can establish that the
error was due to insufficient or incorrect information given to the multivendor
marketplace platform by the seller and relied on by the multivendor marketplace
platform. This subdivision shall not apply if the multivendor marketplace
platform and the seller are related persons under either section 267(b) or (c)
or section 707(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also
the multivendor marketplace platform operator.
(2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been erroneously
or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the purchaser
qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax Commissioner shall set
forth that fact in his or her records and the excess amount collected or paid
may be credited on any sales, use, or income tax amounts then due and payable
from the person under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be
refunded to the person by whom it was paid or his or her successors,
administrators, or executors.
(b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with the
Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her attorney,
executor, or administrator within three years from the required filing date
following the close of the period for which the overpayment was made, within
six months after any determination becomes final under section 77-2709, or
within six months from the date of overpayment with respect to such
determinations, whichever of these three periods expires later, unless the
credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been given. Failure to file a
claim within the time prescribed in this subsection shall constitute a waiver
of any demand against the state on account of overpayment.
(c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which the
claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two dollars.
(d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing shall
constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The claimant and the
Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-hundred-eighty-day period. If
a hearing has not been requested and the Tax Commissioner has neither allowed
nor disallowed a claim within either the one hundred eighty days or the period
agreed to by the claimant and the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed
to have been allowed.
(e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in part,
the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the claimant in
the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.
(f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the taxpayer
seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided in section
77-27,127.
(g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without authority, or
of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, interest
shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such credit or refund at the rate
specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted,
from the date such sum was paid or from the date the return was required to be
filed, whichever date is later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or,
in the case of a credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit
is allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess of
actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest shall be
allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
(h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally determined
or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed.
(i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof which is
erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is erroneously allowed by
issuing a deficiency determination within one year from the date of refund or
credit or within the period otherwise allowed for issuing a deficiency
determination, whichever expires later.
(j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not including
interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as such section
existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated pursuant to 26
-21-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges or interest; sales
or use taxes charged on the purchase price; uncollectible amounts on property
that remains in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is
paid; and expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt and repossessed
property.
(ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during which
the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. A
claimant who is not required to file federal income tax returns may deduct a
bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt is written off
as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for
a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was
required to file a federal income tax return.
(iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is subsequently
collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so collected must be paid
and reported on the return filed for the period in which the collection is
made.
(iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales for
the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim may be
filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for refund claims.
The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due date of the return on
which the bad debt could first be claimed.
(v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified service
provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the retailer, any bad
debt allowance provided by this section. The certified service provider shall
credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt allowance or refund received
to the retailer.
(vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously claimed
bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied first
proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and the sales
tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other charges.
(vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party claiming
the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts among the member
states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the state shall permit
the allocation.
(3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section involves
a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or section 13-319,
13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be refunded is at least five
thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city, village,
county, or municipal county of such claim within twenty days after receiving
the claim. If the Tax Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax
is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the
affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall
give the city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county shall make
its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax Commissioner within
twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The Tax Commissioner shall
then deduct such refund from the applicable tax proceeds in accordance with the
selection when he or she deducts refunds pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814,
or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable.
This subsection shall not apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision
(2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii) or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
Sec. 40. Section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2711 (1)(a) The Tax Commissioner shall enforce sections 77-2701.04 to
77-2713 and may prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and regulations relating to
the administration and enforcement of such sections.
(b) The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the extent to which any ruling or
regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.
(2) The Tax Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors, investigators,
assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient administration of the
Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and may delegate authority to his or her
representatives to conduct hearings, prescribe regulations, or perform any
other duties imposed by such act.
(3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing, using, or
otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a retailer shall keep
such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent papers in such form as
the Tax Commissioner may reasonably require.
(b) Every such seller, retailer, or person shall keep such records for not
less than three years from the making of such records unless the Tax
Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
(4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him or her
may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any person selling
property and any person liable for the use tax and may investigate the
character of the business of the person in order to verify the accuracy of any
return made or, if no return is made by the person, to ascertain and determine
the amount required to be paid. In the examination of any person selling
property or of any person liable for the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as
to the accuracy of the reporting of city and county sales and use taxes for
which the person is liable under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections
13-319, 13-324, 13-2813, and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made
between the various counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the
-22-
LB650 LB650
2025 2025
tax due. The Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person having
custody of the records for providing such copies.
(5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her records
at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records available to
the Tax Commissioner at all times.
(6) In administration of the use tax, the Tax Commissioner may require the
filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in his, her, or
their possession or custody information relating to sales of property, the
storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to the tax. The report
shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and shall set forth the names
and addresses of purchasers of the property, the sales price of the property,
the date of sale, and such other information as the Tax Commissioner may
require.
(7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner or any
official or employee of the Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, or the
Department of Administrative Services to make known in any manner whatever the
business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an investigation of
records and activities of any retailer or any other person visited or examined
in the discharge of official duty or the amount or source of income, profits,
losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any
return, or to permit any return or copy thereof, or any book containing any
abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person not
connected with the Tax Commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to prohibit (a) the delivery to a taxpayer, his or her duly authorized
representative, or his or her successors, receivers, trustees, executors,
administrators, assignees, or guarantors, if directly interested, of a
certified copy of any return or report in connection with his or her tax, (b)
the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of
particular reports or returns and the items thereof, (c) the inspection by the
Attorney General, other legal representative of the state, or county attorney
of the reports or returns of any taxpayer when either (i) information on the
reports or returns is considered by the Attorney General to be relevant to any
action or proceeding instituted by the taxpayer or against whom an action or
proceeding is being considered or has been commenced by any state agency or the
county or (ii) the taxpayer has instituted an action to review the tax based
thereon or an action or proceeding against the taxpayer for collection of tax
or failure to comply with the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 is being considered
or has been commenced, (d) the furnishing of any information to the United
States Government or to states allowing similar privileges to the Tax
Commissioner, (e) the disclosure of information and records to a collection
agency contracting with the Tax Commissioner pursuant to sections 77-377.01 to
77-377.04, (f) the disclosure to another party to a transaction of information
and records concerning the transaction between the taxpayer and the other
party, (g) the disclosure of information pursuant to section 77-27,195,
77-5731, 77-6837, 77-6839, or 77-6928, or (h) the disclosure of information to
the Department of Labor necessary for the administration of the Employment
Security Law, the Contractor Registration Act, or the Employee Classification
Act.
(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, the
Tax Commissioner may permit the Postal Inspector of the United States Postal
Service or his or her delegates to inspect the reports or returns of any person
filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 when information on the
reports or returns is relevant to any action or proceeding instituted or being
considered by the United States Postal Service against such person for the
fraudulent use of the mails to carry and deliver false and fraudulent tax
returns to the Tax Commissioner with the intent to defraud the State of
Nebraska or to evade the payment of Nebraska state taxes.
(9) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, the
Tax Commissioner may permit other tax officials of this state to inspect the
tax returns, reports, and applications filed under sections 77-2701.04 to
77-2713, but such inspection shall be permitted only for purposes of enforcing
a tax law and only to the extent and under the conditions prescribed by the
rules and regulations of the Tax Commissioner.
(10) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, the
Tax Commissioner may, upon request, provide the county board of any county
which has exercised the authority granted by section 81-3716 with a list of the
names and addresses of the hotels located within the county for which lodging
sales tax returns have been filed or for which lodging sales taxes have been
remitted for the county's County Visitors Promotion Fund under the Nebraska
Visitors Development Act.
The information provided by the Tax Commissioner shall indicate only the
names and addresses of the hotels located within the requesting county for
which lodging sales tax returns have been filed for a specified period and the
fact that lodging sales taxes remitted by or on behalf of the hotel have
constituted a portion of the total sum remitted by the state to the county for
a specified period under the provisions of the Nebraska Visitors Development
Act. No additional information shall be revealed.
(11)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (7) of this section,
the Tax Commissioner shall, upon written request by the Auditor of Public
Accounts or the office of Legislative Audit, make tax returns and tax return
information open to inspection by or disclosure to the Auditor of Public
Accounts or employees of the office of Legislative Audit for the purpose of and

the audit of the Department of Revenue shall be stored in a secure place in the
Department of Revenue.
(b) No employee of the Auditor of Public Accounts or the office of
Legislative Audit shall disclose to any person, other than another Auditor of
Public Accounts or office employee whose official duties require such
disclosure, any return or return information described in the Nebraska Revenue
Act of 1967 in a form which can be associated with or otherwise identify,

(16)(a) The purpose of this subsection is to set forth the state's policy
for the protection of the confidentiality rights of all participants in the
system operated pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement and of
the privacy interests of consumers who deal with model 1 sellers.
(b) For purposes of this subsection:
(i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a person;
(ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
(iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
identifies a person.
(c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers is to
preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity. With very
limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform its tax
calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without retaining the
personally identifiable information of consumers.
(d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined sales and
use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only if that
certified service provider certifies that:
(i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the fundamental
precept of anonymity is respected;
(ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained to the
extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to exempt
purchasers;
(iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
information practices, including what information it collects, how it collects
the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at all, it retains
the information, and whether it discloses the information to member states.
Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy policy statement accessible
by the public on the website of the certified service provider;
(iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure the
validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a consumer's
status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased; and
(v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
unauthorized access and disclosure.
(e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers, including
exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the collection, use,
and retention of personally identifiable information.
(f) When any personally identifiable information that has been collected
and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth in subdivision
(16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no longer be retained by
the member states.
(g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual is
retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable access by
such individual to his or her own information in the state's possession and a
right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
(h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by that
state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally identifiable
information, the state from whom the information is sought should make a
reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of such request.
(i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney General.
(j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and
maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully applicable and
binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not enlarge or limit the
state's authority to:
(i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement and
state law;
(ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information Act,
disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
(iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
taxpayer information;

(iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of federal
return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the Internal
Revenue Service; and

governmental purposes.

after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the property tax credit
provided in this section results in a property tax liability on the homestead
that is less than zero, the amount of the credit which cannot be used by the
taxpayer shall be returned to the Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the
year the amount disbursed to the county was disbursed. The Property Tax
Administrator shall immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection
to the School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund. Upon the return of any
funds under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a
report with the Property Tax Administrator, on a form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner, indicating the amount of funds distributed to each school
district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the amount of
unused credits returned.
(4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be equal
to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of this section
multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied in the prior year
on all real property in the county to the school district taxes levied in the
prior year on all real property in the state. By September 15, 2024, and by
September 15 of each year thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount to be disbursed under this subsection to each county and
shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The
disbursements to the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on
or before January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
(5) The county treasurer shall disburse amounts received under subsection
(4) of this section, which are credited against the amount of property taxes
owed to school districts, in the same manner as if such funds had been received
in the form of property tax payments for property taxes owed to school
districts, meaning any amounts attributable to divided taxes pursuant to

Section 37:
section 18-2147 of the Community Development Law shall be remitted to the
applicable authority for which such taxes were divided.
(6) The School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund shall be used for
purposes of making the disbursements to counties required under subsection (4)
of this section.

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Sections 1 to 8 of this act shall be known and may be cited as
the Community Development Assistance Act.
Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby finds that areas of chronic economic
distress in the State of Nebraska are a detriment to the economic well-being,
health, and safety of the citizens of Nebraska. The Legislature further
contends that current governmental solutions have not been able to completely
resolve certain problems such as overcrowding, unemployment, and poor health
and sanitary conditions in a community which lead to further deterioration.
Such problems cannot be remedied by the government alone, but can be alleviated
through a partnership between the government and private enterprise. It is
therefore declared to be public policy in this state to encourage contributions
by business firms and individuals that offer and provide community and
neighborhood assistance and community services.
Sec. 3. For purposes of the Community Development Assistance Act, unless
the context otherwise requires:
(1) Area of chronic economic distress means an area of the state which
meets any of the following conditions:
(a) An unemployment rate which exceeds the statewide average unemployment
rate;
(b) A per capita income below the statewide average per capita income; or
(c) A population loss between the two most recent federal decennial
censuses;
(2) Business firm means any business entity, including a corporation, a
fiduciary, a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a limited liability company, a
corporation having an election in effect under Chapter 1, subchapter S, of the
Internal Revenue Code, subject to the state income tax imposed by section
77-2715 or 77-2734.02, an insurance company paying premium or related
retaliatory taxes in this state pursuant to section 44-150 or 77-908, or a
financial institution paying the tax imposed pursuant to sections 77-3801 to
77-3807;
(3) Community assistance means furnishing financial assistance, labor,
material, or technical advice to aid in the physical improvement of any part or
all of a community development area;
(4) Community betterment organization means (a) any organization
performing community services or offering community assistance in a community
development area and to which contributions are tax deductible under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States Department of
the Treasury and (b) a county, city, or village performing community services
or offering community assistance in a community development area;
(5) Community development area means any village, city, county,
unincorporated area of a county, or census tract which has been designated by
the department as an area of chronic economic distress;
-1-

development area: (a) Employment training; (b) human services; (c) medical
services; (d) physical facility and neighborhood development services; (e)

prevention activities, including, but not limited to, (i) the instruction of

services, (iv) community, youth, day care, and senior citizen centers, (v) in-
home services, (vi) home improvement services and programs, and (vii) any legal
enterprise which aids in the prevention or reduction of crime;

assistance or community services in a community development area may apply any
time during the fiscal year to the department to have one or more programs
certified for tax credit status as provided in sections 5 to 8 of this act. The
proposal shall set forth the program to be conducted, the community development
area, the estimated amount to be required for completion of the program or the
annual estimated amount required for an ongoing program, the plans for
implementing the program, and the amount of contributions committed or
anticipated for such activities or services.
Sec. 5. If the subdivision of local government has adopted a community
development plan for an area which includes the area in which the community
betterment organization is providing community assistance or community
services, the organization shall submit a copy of the program proposal to the
chief executive officer of such subdivision. If the program proposal is
consistent with the adopted community development plan, the chief executive
officer shall so certify to the department for the department's approval or
disapproval. If the program proposal is not consistent with the adopted
community development plan of the local subdivision, the chief executive
officer shall so indicate and the proposal shall not be approved by the
department. If the proposed activities are consistent with the adopted
community development plan, but for other reasons they are not viewed as
appropriate by the local subdivision, the chief executive officer shall so
indicate and the department shall review the program proposal and approve or
disapprove it. The local subdivision shall review the proposal within forty-
five days from the date of receipt for review. If the subdivision does not
issue its finding concerning the proposal within forty-five days after receipt,
the proposal shall be deemed approved. The department shall approve or
disapprove a program proposal submitted pursuant to section 4 of this act
within forty-five days of receipt by the department.
Sec. 6. (1) The director shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
for the approval or disapproval of the program proposals submitted pursuant to
section 5 of this act taking into account the economic need level and the
geographic distribution of the population of the community development area.
The director shall also adopt and promulgate rules and regulations concerning
the amount of the tax credit for which a program shall be certified. The tax
credits shall be available for contributions to a certified program which may
qualify as a charitable contribution deduction on the federal income tax return
filed by the business firm or individual making such contribution. The decision
of the department to approve or disapprove all or any portion of a proposal
shall be in writing. If the proposal is approved, the maximum tax credit
allowance for the certified program shall be stated along with the approval.
The maximum tax credit allowance approved by the department shall be final for
the fiscal year in which the program is certified. A copy of all decisions
shall be transmitted to the Tax Commissioner. A copy of all credits allowed to
business firms under sections 44-150 and 77-908 shall be transmitted to the
Director of Insurance.
(2) For all business firms and individuals eligible for the credit allowed
by section 7 of this act, except for insurance companies paying premium and
related retaliatory taxes in this state pursuant to section 44-150 or 77-908,
the Tax Commissioner shall provide for the manner in which the credit allowed
by section 7 of this act shall be taken and the forms on which such credit
shall be allowed. The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations for the method of providing tax credits. The Director of Insurance
shall provide for the manner in which the credit allowed by section 7 of this

which such credit shall be allowed. The Director of Insurance may adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations for the method of providing the tax credit.
The Tax Commissioner shall allow against any income tax due from the insurance
companies paying premium and related retaliatory taxes in this state pursuant
to section 44-150 or 77-908 a credit for the credit provided by section 7 of
this act and allowed by the Director of Insurance.
Sec. 7. (1) Any business firm or individual which plans to or which has
contributed to a certified program of a community betterment organization may
apply to the department for authorization for a tax credit for the contribution
to the certified program in an amount up to but not exceeding the maximum tax
credit allowed by the department. The maximum tax credit allowed by the
department for each approved business firm or individual shall be in an amount
which does not exceed forty percent of the total amount contributed by the
business firm or individual during its taxable year to any programs certified
pursuant to section 5 of this act. The director shall send a copy of the

approved application which includes the amount of the tax credit to be allowed
and a certification by the department that the contribution has been paid as

grant a tax credit against any tax due under sections 77-2715, 77-2734.02, and
77-3801 to 77-3807 and to the Director of Insurance who shall grant a tax
credit against any premium and related retaliatory taxes due under sections
44-150 and 77-908.
(2) No tax credit shall be granted to any business firm or individual in
this state pursuant to the Community Development Assistance Act for activities
that are a part of its normal course of business. Any tax credit balance may be
carried over and applied against the business firm's or individual's tax
liability for the next five years immediately succeeding the tax year in which
the credit was first allowed.
Sec. 8. The total amount of tax credit granted for programs approved and
certified under the Community Development Assistance Act by the department for

installing of the services defined in subdivision (2)(a), (b), (d), or (e) of
section 77-2701.16, or every person engaged as a retailer of intellectual or
entertainment properties referred to in subsection (3) of section 77-2701.16;
the gross receipts from the sale of admissions in this state; the gross
receipts from the sale of warranties, guarantees, service agreements, or
maintenance agreements when the items covered are subject to tax under this
section; beginning January 1, 2008, the gross receipts from the sale of bundled
transactions when one or more of the products included in the bundle are
taxable; the gross receipts from the provision of services defined in
subsection (4) of section 77-2701.16; and the gross receipts from the sale of
products delivered electronically as described in subsection (9) of section
77-2701.16. Except as provided in section 77-2701.03, when there is a sale, the
tax shall be imposed at the rate in effect at the time the gross receipts are
realized under the accounting basis used by the retailer to maintain his or her
books and records.
(a) The tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the retailer
from the consumer. It shall constitute a part of the purchase price and until
collected shall be a debt from the consumer to the retailer and shall be
recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts. The tax required to be
collected by the retailer from the consumer constitutes a debt owed by the
retailer to this state.
(b) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise, hold out, or state to
the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or part
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer, that it will not be added
to the selling, renting, or leasing price of the property sold, rented, or
leased, or that, if added, it or any part thereof will be refunded. The
provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a public utility.
(c) The tax required to be collected by the retailer from the purchaser,
unless otherwise provided by statute or by rule and regulation of the Tax
Commissioner, shall be displayed separately from the list price, the price
advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other price on the sales check
or other proof of sales, rentals, or leases.
(d) For the purpose of more efficiently securing the payment, collection,
and accounting for the sales tax and for the convenience of the retailer in
collecting the sales tax, it shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to
provide a schedule or schedules of the amounts to be collected from the
consumer or user to effectuate the computation and collection of the tax
imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Such schedule or schedules shall
provide that the tax shall be collected from the consumer or user uniformly on
sales according to brackets based on sales prices of the item or items.
Retailers may compute the tax due on any transaction on an item or an invoice
basis. The rounding rule provided in section 77-3,117 applies.
(e) The use of tokens or stamps for the purpose of collecting or enforcing
the collection of the taxes imposed in the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 or for
any other purpose in connection with such taxes is prohibited.
(f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions of the
Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the retail sales tax, it
shall be presumed that all gross receipts are subject to the tax until the
contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale of property is not a
sale at retail is upon the person who makes the sale unless he or she takes
from the purchaser (i) a resale certificate to the effect that the property is
purchased for the purpose of reselling, leasing, or renting it, (ii) an
exemption certificate pursuant to subsection (7) of section 77-2705, or (iii) a
direct payment permit pursuant to sections 77-2705.01 to 77-2705.03. Receipt of
a resale certificate, exemption certificate, or direct payment permit shall be
conclusive proof for the seller that the sale was made for resale or was exempt
or that the tax will be paid directly to the state.
(g) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers,
and truck-tractors as defined in the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, the tax
shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price, except as
otherwise provided within this section.
(h) In the rental or lease of automobiles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers,
and truck-tractors as defined in the act, for periods of one year or more, the
lessor may elect not to collect and remit the sales tax on the gross receipts
and instead pay a sales tax on the cost of such vehicle. If such election is
made, it shall be made pursuant to the following conditions:
(i) Notice of the desire to make such election shall be filed with the Tax
Commissioner and shall not become effective until the Tax Commissioner is
satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with all conditions of this subsection
and all rules and regulations of the Tax Commissioner;
(ii) Such election when made shall continue in force and effect for a
period of not less than two years and thereafter until such time as the lessor
elects to terminate the election;
(iii) When such election is made, it shall apply to all vehicles of the
lessor rented or leased for periods of one year or more except vehicles to be
-16-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
leased to common or contract carriers who provide to the lessor a valid common
or contract carrier exemption certificate. If the lessor rents or leases other
vehicles for periods of less than one year, such lessor shall maintain his or
her books and records and his or her accounting procedure as the Tax
Commissioner prescribes; and
(iv) The Tax Commissioner by rule and regulation shall prescribe the
contents and form of the notice of election, a procedure for the determination
of the tax base of vehicles which are under an existing lease at the time such
election becomes effective, the method and manner for terminating such
election, and such other rules and regulations as may be necessary for the
proper administration of this subdivision.
(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sales of motor vehicles,
semitrailers, and trailers as defined in sections 60-339, 60-348, and 60-354
shall be the liability of the purchaser and, with the exception of motor
vehicles, semitrailers, and trailers registered pursuant to section 60-3,198,
the tax shall be collected by the county treasurer as provided in the Motor
Vehicle Registration Act or by an approved licensed dealer participating in the
electronic dealer services system pursuant to section 60-1507 at the time the
purchaser makes application for the registration of the motor vehicle,
semitrailer, or trailer for operation upon the highways of this state. The tax
imposed by this section on motor vehicles, semitrailers, and trailers
registered pursuant to section 60-3,198 shall be collected by the Department of
Motor Vehicles at the time the purchaser makes application for the registration
of the motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation upon the highways
of this state. At the time of the sale of any motor vehicle, semitrailer, or
trailer, the seller shall (i) state on the sales invoice the dollar amount of
the tax imposed under this section and (ii) furnish to the purchaser a
certified statement of the transaction, in such form as the Tax Commissioner
prescribes, setting forth as a minimum the total sales price, the allowance for
any trade-in, and the difference between the two. The sales tax due shall be
computed on the difference between the total sales price and the allowance for
any trade-in as disclosed by such certified statement. Any seller who willfully
understates the amount upon which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a
penalty of one thousand dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also
be furnished to the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to
furnish such certified statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall,
upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five
dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not register
such motor vehicle, semitrailer, or trailer for operation on the highways of
this state within thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed by this
section shall immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to the county
treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles. If the tax is not paid on or
before the thirtieth day after its purchase, the county treasurer or Department
of Motor Vehicles shall also collect from the purchaser interest from the
thirtieth day through the date of payment and sales tax penalties as provided
in the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The county treasurer or Department of
Motor Vehicles shall report and remit the tax so collected to the Tax
Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month. The county treasurer,
for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold, from all amounts
required to be collected under this subsection, the collection fee permitted to
be deducted by any retailer collecting the sales tax, all of which shall be
deposited in the county general fund, plus an additional amount equal to one-
half of one percent of all amounts in excess of six thousand dollars remitted
each month. Prior to January 1, 2023, fifty percent of such additional amount
shall be deposited in the county general fund and fifty percent of such
additional amount shall be deposited in the county road fund. On and after
January 1, 2023, seventy-five percent of such additional amount shall be
deposited in the county general fund and twenty-five percent of such additional
amount shall be deposited in the county road fund. In any county with a
population of one hundred fifty thousand inhabitants or more, the county
treasurer shall remit one dollar of his or her collection fee for each of the
first five thousand motor vehicles, semitrailers, or trailers registered with
such county treasurer on or after January 1, 2020, to the State Treasurer for
credit to the Department of Revenue Enforcement Fund. The Department of Motor
Vehicles, for its collection fee, shall deduct, withhold, and deposit in the
Motor Carrier Division Cash Fund the collection fee permitted to be deducted by
any retailer collecting the sales tax. The collection fee for the county
treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles shall be forfeited if the county
treasurer or department violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the
collection of the use tax.
(j)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of a motorboat as
defined in section 37-1204 shall be the liability of the purchaser. The tax
shall be collected by the county treasurer at the time the purchaser makes
application for the registration of the motorboat. At the time of the sale of a
motorboat, the seller shall (A) state on the sales invoice the dollar amount of
the tax imposed under this section and (B) furnish to the purchaser a certified
statement of the transaction, in such form as the Tax Commissioner prescribes,
setting forth as a minimum the total sales price, the allowance for any trade-
in, and the difference between the two. The sales tax due shall be computed on
the difference between the total sales price and the allowance for any trade-in
as disclosed by such certified statement. Any seller who willfully understates
the amount upon which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one
thousand dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to
-17-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such certified
statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof,
be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one
hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not register such motorboat within
thirty days of the purchase thereof, the tax imposed by this section shall
immediately thereafter be paid by the purchaser to the county treasurer. If the
tax is not paid on or before the thirtieth day after its purchase, the county
treasurer shall also collect from the purchaser interest from the thirtieth day
through the date of payment and sales tax penalties as provided in the Nebraska
Revenue Act of 1967. The county treasurer shall report and remit the tax so
collected to the Tax Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month.
The county treasurer, for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold
for the use of the county general fund, from all amounts required to be
collected under this subsection, the collection fee permitted to be deducted by
any retailer collecting the sales tax. The collection fee shall be forfeited if
the county treasurer violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the
collection of the use tax.
(ii) In the rental or lease of motorboats, the tax shall be collected by
the lessor on the rental or lease price.
(k)(i) The tax imposed by this section on the sale of an all-terrain
vehicle as defined in section 60-103 or a utility-type vehicle as defined in
section 60-135.01 shall be the liability of the purchaser. The tax shall be
collected by the county treasurer or by an approved licensed dealer
participating in the electronic dealer services system pursuant to section
60-1507 at the time the purchaser makes application for the certificate of
title for the all-terrain vehicle or utility-type vehicle. At the time of the
sale of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-type vehicle, the seller shall (A)
state on the sales invoice the dollar amount of the tax imposed under this
section and (B) furnish to the purchaser a certified statement of the
transaction, in such form as the Tax Commissioner prescribes, setting forth as
a minimum the total sales price, the allowance for any trade-in, and the
difference between the two. The sales tax due shall be computed on the
difference between the total sales price and the allowance for any trade-in as
disclosed by such certified statement. Any seller who willfully understates the
amount upon which the sales tax is due shall be subject to a penalty of one
thousand dollars. A copy of such certified statement shall also be furnished to
the Tax Commissioner. Any seller who fails or refuses to furnish such certified
statement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof,
be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one
hundred dollars. If the purchaser does not obtain a certificate of title for
such all-terrain vehicle or utility-type vehicle within thirty days of the
purchase thereof, the tax imposed by this section shall immediately thereafter
be paid by the purchaser to the county treasurer. If the tax is not paid on or
before the thirtieth day after its purchase, the county treasurer shall also
collect from the purchaser interest from the thirtieth day through the date of
payment and sales tax penalties as provided in the Nebraska Revenue Act of
1967. The county treasurer shall report and remit the tax so collected to the
Tax Commissioner by the fifteenth day of the following month. The county
treasurer, for his or her collection fee, shall deduct and withhold for the use
of the county general fund, from all amounts required to be collected under
this subsection, the collection fee permitted to be deducted by any retailer
collecting the sales tax. The collection fee shall be forfeited if the county
treasurer violates any rule or regulation pertaining to the collection of the
use tax.
(ii) In the rental or lease of an all-terrain vehicle or a utility-type
vehicle, the tax shall be collected by the lessor on the rental or lease price.
(iii) County treasurers are appointed as sales and use tax collectors for
all sales of all-terrain vehicles or utility-type vehicles made outside of this
state to purchasers or users of all-terrain vehicles or utility-type vehicles
which are required to have a certificate of title in this state. The county
treasurer shall collect the applicable use tax from the purchaser of an all-
terrain vehicle or a utility-type vehicle purchased outside of this state at
the time application for a certificate of title is made. The full use tax on
the purchase price shall be collected by the county treasurer if a sales or
occupation tax was not paid by the purchaser in the state of purchase. If a
sales or occupation tax was lawfully paid in the state of purchase at a rate
less than the tax imposed in this state, use tax must be collected on the
difference as a condition for obtaining a certificate of title in this state.
(l) The Tax Commissioner shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules and
regulations for determining the amount subject to the taxes imposed by this
section so as to insure that the full amount of any applicable tax is paid in
cases in which a sale is made of which a part is subject to the taxes imposed
by this section and a part of which is not so subject and a separate accounting
is not practical or economical.
(2) A use tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption
in this state of property purchased, leased, or rented from any retailer and on
any transaction the gross receipts of which are subject to tax under subsection
(1) of this section on or after June 1, 1967, for storage, use, or other
consumption in this state at the rate set as provided in subsection (1) of this
section on the sales price of the property or, in the case of leases or
rentals, of the lease or rental prices.
(a) Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this state
property purchased from a retailer or leased or rented from another person for
-18-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
such purpose shall be liable for the use tax at the rate in effect when his or
her liability for the use tax becomes certain under the accounting basis used
to maintain his or her books and records. His or her liability shall not be
extinguished until the use tax has been paid to this state, except that a
receipt from a retailer engaged in business in this state or from a retailer
who is authorized by the Tax Commissioner, under such rules and regulations as
he or she may prescribe, to collect the sales tax and who is, for the purposes
of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 relating to the sales tax, regarded as a
retailer engaged in business in this state, which receipt is given to the
purchaser pursuant to subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be sufficient
to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which the
receipt refers.
(b) Every retailer engaged in business in this state and selling, leasing,
or renting property for storage, use, or other consumption in this state shall,
at the time of making any sale, collect any tax which may be due from the
purchaser and shall give to the purchaser, upon request, a receipt therefor in
the manner and form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
(c) The Tax Commissioner, in order to facilitate the proper administration
of the use tax, may designate such person or persons as he or she may deem
necessary to be use tax collectors and delegate to such persons such authority
as is necessary to collect any use tax which is due and payable to the State of
Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner may require of all persons so designated a
surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure against any
misappropriation of state funds so collected. The Tax Commissioner may require
any tax official, city, county, or state, to collect the use tax on behalf of
the state. All persons designated to or required to collect the use tax shall
account for such collections in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
Nothing in this subdivision shall be so construed as to prevent the Tax
Commissioner or his or her employees from collecting any use taxes due and
payable to the State of Nebraska.
(d) All persons designated to collect the use tax and all persons required
to collect the use tax shall forward the total of such collections to the Tax
Commissioner at such time and in such manner as the Tax Commissioner may
prescribe. Such collectors of the use tax shall deduct and withhold from the
amount of taxes collected two and one-half three percent of the first three
five thousand dollars remitted each month as reimbursement for the cost of
collecting the tax. Any such deduction shall be forfeited to the State of
Nebraska if such collector violates any rule, regulation, or directive of the
Tax Commissioner.
(e) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue
Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, it shall be presumed that
property sold, leased, or rented by any person for delivery in this state is
sold, leased, or rented for storage, use, or other consumption in this state
until the contrary is established. The burden of proving the contrary is upon
the person who purchases, leases, or rents the property.
(f) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue
Act of 1967 and to prevent evasion of the use tax, for the sale of property to
an advertising agency which purchases the property as an agent for a disclosed
or undisclosed principal, the advertising agency is and remains liable for the
sales and use tax on the purchase the same as if the principal had made the
purchase directly.
Sec. 38. Section 77-2706.02, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
77-2706.02 (1) This section applies on and after July 1, 2026.
(2) The appointment of purchasing agents shall be recognized for the
purpose of permitting a construction contractor to purchase materials tax free
based on the buyer-based exemption of the contractor's client for items that
are physically annexed to the structure and which subsequently belong to the
client who is eligible for the buyer-based exemption. The appointment of
purchasing agents shall be in writing and occur prior to having any buyer-based
tax-exempt items annexed to real estate in the construction, improvement, or
repair. The contractor who has been appointed as a purchasing agent may
purchase the materials tax free or may apply for a refund of or use as a credit
against a future use tax liability the tax paid on inventory items annexed to
real estate in the construction, improvement, or repair of a project that
belongs to the client who is eligible for the buyer-based exemption.
(3) A client described in subsection (2) of this section which enters into
a contract of construction, improvement, or repair with respect to buyer-based
tax-exempt items annexed to real estate without first issuing a purchasing
agent authorization to a construction contractor prior to such items being
annexed to real estate in the project may apply to the Tax Commissioner for a
refund of any sales and use tax paid by the contractor on such items physically
annexed to real estate in the construction, improvement, or repair.
(4) For purposes of this section, client means a nonprofit entity.
Sec. 39. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner monthly on or before
the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each monthly period unless
otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967.
(b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each monthly
period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require, a return for
such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner
-19-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may prescribe and containing
such information as the Tax Commissioner deems necessary for the proper
administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he
or she deems it necessary in order to insure payment to or facilitate the
collection by the state of the amount of sales or use taxes due, may require
returns and payment of the amount of such taxes for periods other than monthly
periods in the case of a particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case
may be. The Tax Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and
tax payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers', or
purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars, quarterly
returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine hundred dollars
or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly returns shall be
required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand dollars or more. The
Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow an annual return for
seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax liability exceeds the amounts
listed in this subdivision.
The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making monthly
remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic funds transfer or
for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to the streamlined sales
and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations may establish a method of
determining the amount of the payment that will result in substantially all of
the tax liability being paid each quarter. At least once each year, the
difference between the amount paid and the amount due shall be reconciled. If
the difference is more than ten percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty
percent of the unpaid amount shall be imposed.
(ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state of the
tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all licensed
locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of this
subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own eighty
percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use tax, a
return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in this state and
by every person who has purchased property, the storage, use, or other
consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has not paid the use
tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
(iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent but
need not be verified by oath.
(iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a cash
basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting basis which
correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the sales and use tax
returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on the same accounting
basis that is used for the regular books and records, except that on credit,
conditional, and installment sales, the retailer who keeps his or her books on
an accrual basis may report such sales on the cash basis and pay the tax upon
the collections made during each month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells,
assigns, or otherwise disposes of an account receivable, he or she shall be
deemed to have received the full balance of the consideration for the original
sale and shall be liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of
the total sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer to a
subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the sales tax on
the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior to the time the
customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary does not obtain a
Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a surety bond in favor of
the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the tax and any interest and penalty
imposed thereon under this section in an amount not less than two times the
amount of tax payable on outstanding accounts receivable held by the subsidiary
as of the end of the prior calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax
permit or a surety bond in accordance with this section shall result in the
payment on the next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously
remitted. When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting
credit, conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having notified
the Tax Commissioner.
(c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail any required return
together with a remittance of the net amount of the tax due to the office of
the Tax Commissioner on or before the required filing date. Failure to file the
return, filing after the required filing date, failure to remit the net amount
of the tax due, or remitting the net amount of the tax due after the required
filing date shall be cause for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten
percent of the amount of tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-
five dollars, whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a county
treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the penalty shall
be five dollars.
(d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise due
from him or her on his or her tax return, two and one-half three percent of the
first three five thousand dollars remitted each month to reimburse himself or
-20-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
herself for the cost of collecting the tax. Taxpayers filing a combined return
as allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii) of this subsection shall compute such
collection fees on the basis of the receipts and liability of each licensed
location.
(e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit sales
taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must include all sales into
Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but may claim credit for any
sales taxes collected and remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform with
respect to such retailer's sales. Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due
on sales into Nebraska as provided in section 77-2704.35.
(f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to
collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to Nebraska
to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can establish that the
error was due to insufficient or incorrect information given to the multivendor
marketplace platform by the seller and relied on by the multivendor marketplace
platform. This subdivision shall not apply if the multivendor marketplace
platform and the seller are related persons under either section 267(b) or (c)
or section 707(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also
the multivendor marketplace platform operator.
(2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been erroneously
or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the purchaser
qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax Commissioner shall set
forth that fact in his or her records and the excess amount collected or paid
may be credited on any sales, use, or income tax amounts then due and payable
from the person under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be
refunded to the person by whom it was paid or his or her successors,
administrators, or executors.
(b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with the
Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her attorney,
executor, or administrator within three years from the required filing date
following the close of the period for which the overpayment was made, within
six months after any determination becomes final under section 77-2709, or
within six months from the date of overpayment with respect to such
determinations, whichever of these three periods expires later, unless the
credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been given. Failure to file a
claim within the time prescribed in this subsection shall constitute a waiver
of any demand against the state on account of overpayment.
(c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which the
claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two dollars.
(d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing shall
constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The claimant and the
Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-hundred-eighty-day period. If
a hearing has not been requested and the Tax Commissioner has neither allowed
nor disallowed a claim within either the one hundred eighty days or the period
agreed to by the claimant and the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed
to have been allowed.
(e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in part,
the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the claimant in
the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.
(f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the taxpayer
seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided in section
77-27,127.
(g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without authority, or
of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, interest
shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such credit or refund at the rate
specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted,
from the date such sum was paid or from the date the return was required to be
filed, whichever date is later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or,
in the case of a credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit
is allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess of
actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest shall be
allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
(h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally determined
or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed.
(i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof which is
erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is erroneously allowed by
issuing a deficiency determination within one year from the date of refund or
credit or within the period otherwise allowed for issuing a deficiency
determination, whichever expires later.
(j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not including
interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as such section
existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated pursuant to 26
-21-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges or interest; sales
or use taxes charged on the purchase price; uncollectible amounts on property
that remains in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is
paid; and expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt and repossessed
property.
(ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during which
the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. A
claimant who is not required to file federal income tax returns may deduct a
bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt is written off
as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for
a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was
required to file a federal income tax return.
(iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is subsequently
collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so collected must be paid
and reported on the return filed for the period in which the collection is
made.
(iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales for
the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim may be
filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for refund claims.
The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due date of the return on
which the bad debt could first be claimed.
(v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified service
provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the retailer, any bad
debt allowance provided by this section. The certified service provider shall
credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt allowance or refund received
to the retailer.
(vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously claimed
bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied first
proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and the sales
tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other charges.
(vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party claiming
the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts among the member
states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the state shall permit
the allocation.
(3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section involves
a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or section 13-319,
13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be refunded is at least five
thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city, village,
county, or municipal county of such claim within twenty days after receiving
the claim. If the Tax Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax
is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the
affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall
give the city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county shall make
its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax Commissioner within
twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The Tax Commissioner shall
then deduct such refund from the applicable tax proceeds in accordance with the
selection when he or she deducts refunds pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814,
or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable.
This subsection shall not apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision
(2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii) or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.

the amount required to be paid. In the examination of any person selling
property or of any person liable for the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as
to the accuracy of the reporting of city and county sales and use taxes for
which the person is liable under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections
13-319, 13-324, 13-2813, and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made

shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and shall set forth the names
and addresses of purchasers of the property, the sales price of the property,

require.
(7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner or any

the privacy interests of consumers who deal with model 1 sellers.
(b) For purposes of this subsection:
(i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a person;
(ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
(iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
identifies a person.
(c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers is to
preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity. With very
limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform its tax
calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without retaining the
personally identifiable information of consumers.
(d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined sales and
use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only if that
certified service provider certifies that:
(i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the fundamental
precept of anonymity is respected;
(ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained to the
extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to exempt
purchasers;
(iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
information practices, including what information it collects, how it collects
the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at all, it retains
the information, and whether it discloses the information to member states.
Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy policy statement accessible
by the public on the website of the certified service provider;
(iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure the
validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a consumer's
status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased; and
(v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
unauthorized access and disclosure.
(e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers, including
exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the collection, use,
and retention of personally identifiable information.
(f) When any personally identifiable information that has been collected
and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth in subdivision
(16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no longer be retained by
the member states.
(g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual is
retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable access by
such individual to his or her own information in the state's possession and a
right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
(h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by that
state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally identifiable
information, the state from whom the information is sought should make a
reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of such request.
(i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney General.
(j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and
maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully applicable and
binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not enlarge or limit the
state's authority to:
(i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement and
state law;
(ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information Act,
disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
(iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
taxpayer information;

(iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of federal
return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the Internal
Revenue Service; and

Sec. 57. Section 77-7305, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-7305 (1) The School District Property Tax Relief Act shall apply to tax
year 2024 and each tax year thereafter. The property tax relief shall be in the
form of property tax credits which appear on property tax statements. Property
tax credits granted under the act shall be credited against the amount of
property taxes owed to school districts. The total amount of property tax
relief granted under the act shall be determined as follows:
(a) For tax year 2024, the minimum total amount of relief granted under
the act shall be seven hundred fifty million dollars. For tax year 2025, the
minimum total amount of relief granted under the act shall be seven hundred
eighty million dollars. For tax year 2026, the minimum total amount of relief
granted under the act shall be eight hundred eight million dollars. For tax
year 2027, the minimum total amount of relief granted under the act shall be

total amount of relief granted under the act shall be eight hundred seventy
million dollars. For tax year 2029, the minimum total amount of relief granted

act shall be the minimum total amount of relief from the prior year, excluding
any additional relief provided pursuant to subdivision (1)(b) of this section,
with such amount then increased by three percent; and .
(b) If money is transferred to the School District Property Tax Relief
Credit Fund pursuant to section 77-4602, such amount shall be added to the
minimum amount required under subdivision (1)(a) of this section when
determining the total amount of relief granted under the act for the tax year
in which the transfer occurs. If no such transfer occurs in a given tax year,
the minimum amount required under subdivision (1)(a) of this section shall be
the total amount of relief granted under the act for such tax year. The relief
shall be in the form of property tax credits which appear on property tax
statements. Property tax credits granted under the act shall be credited
against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts.
(2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each parcel,
the county treasurer shall multiply the amount disbursed to the county under
subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
in the prior year on the parcel to the school district taxes levied in the
prior year on all real property in the county. The amount so determined shall
be the property tax credit for that parcel.
(3) If the real property owner qualifies for a homestead exemption under
-35-

LB650 LB650
2025 2025
sections 77-3501 to 77-3529, the owner shall also be qualified for the property
tax credit provided in this section to the extent of any remaining liability
after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the property tax credit
provided in this section results in a property tax liability on the homestead
that is less than zero, the amount of the credit which cannot be used by the
taxpayer shall be returned to the Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the
year the amount disbursed to the county was disbursed. The Property Tax
Administrator shall immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection
to the School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund. Upon the return of any
funds under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a
report with the Property Tax Administrator, on a form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner, indicating the amount of funds distributed to each school
district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the amount of
unused credits returned.
(4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be equal
to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of this section
multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied in the prior year
on all real property in the county to the school district taxes levied in the
prior year on all real property in the state. By September 15, 2024, and by
September 15 of each year thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount to be disbursed under this subsection to each county and
shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The
disbursements to the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on
or before January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
(5) The county treasurer shall disburse amounts received under subsection
(4) of this section, which are credited against the amount of property taxes
owed to school districts, in the same manner as if such funds had been received
in the form of property tax payments for property taxes owed to school
districts, meaning any amounts attributable to divided taxes pursuant to
section 18-2147 of the Community Development Law shall be remitted to the
applicable authority for which such taxes were divided.
(6) The School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund shall be used for
purposes of making the disbursements to counties required under subsection (4)
of this section.
