24 (3) The Property Tax Administrator annually shall make and issue
25 comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of
26 assessment, the degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall
27 compliance with assessment requirements for each major class of real
28 property subject to the property tax in each county. The comprehensive

1 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The

4 Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and
5 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property

10 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections
11 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make
12 and issue a comprehensive study developed in compliance with
13 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques to establish the level
14 of value if in his or her opinion the level of value cannot be developed
15 through the use of the comprehensive assessment ratio studies developed
16 in subsection (3) of this section.
17 (5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically
18 report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property
19 assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the

23 of assessed valuation, including school districts and other political
24 subdivisions, as well as intercounty comparisons of assessed valuation,
25 including school districts and other political subdivisions. The Property
26 Tax Administrator shall include analysis of real property sales pursuant
