Sec. 6. Section 76-901, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
76-901 There is hereby imposed a tax on the grantor executing the deed as
defined in section 76-203 upon the transfer of a beneficial interest in or
legal title to real estate at the rate of two dollars and thirty-two twenty-
five cents for each one thousand dollars value or fraction thereof. For
purposes of sections 76-901 to 76-908, value means (1) in the case of any deed,
not a gift, the amount of the full actual consideration thereof, paid or to be
paid, including the amount of any lien or liens assumed, and (2) in the case of
a gift or any deed with nominal consideration or without stated consideration,
the current market value of the property transferred. Such tax shall be
evidenced by stamps to be attached to the deed. All deeds purporting to
transfer legal title or beneficial interest shall be presumed taxable unless it
clearly appears on the face of the deed or sufficient documentary proof is
presented to the register of deeds that the instrument is exempt under section
76-902.
Sec. 7. Section 76-903, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
76-903 The Tax Commissioner shall design such stamps in such denominations
as in his or her judgment will be the most advantageous to all persons
concerned. When any deed subject to the tax imposed by section 76-901 is
offered for recordation, the register of deeds shall ascertain and compute the
amount of the tax due thereon and shall collect such amount as a prerequisite
to acceptance of the deed for recordation. If a dispute arises concerning the
taxability of the transfer, the register of deeds shall not record the deed
until the disputed tax is paid. If a disputed tax has been paid, the taxpayer
may file for a refund pursuant to section 76-908. The taxpayer may also seek a
declaratory ruling pursuant to rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by
the Department of Revenue. From each two dollars and thirty-two twenty-five
cents of tax collected pursuant to section 76-901, the register of deeds shall
retain fifty cents to be placed in the county general fund and shall remit the
balance to the State Treasurer who shall credit ninety-five cents of such
amount to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, twenty-five cents of such amount
to the Site and Building Development Fund, twenty-five cents of such amount to
the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund, and thirty cents of such amount to
the Behavioral Health Services Fund, and seven cents of such amount to the
Domestic Violence and Sex Trafficking Survivor Housing Assistance Fund.
Sec. 8. Section 77-1327, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
77-1327 (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that accurate and
comprehensive information be developed by the Property Tax Administrator and
made accessible to the taxing officials and property owners in order to ensure
the uniformity and proportionality of the assessments of real property
valuations in the state in accordance with law and to provide the statistical
and narrative reports pursuant to section 77-5027.
(2) All transactions of real property for which the statement required in
section 76-214 is filed shall be available for development of a sales file by
the Property Tax Administrator. All transactions with stated consideration of
more than one hundred dollars or upon which more than two dollars and thirty-
-2-

LB78 LB78
2025 2025
two twenty-five cents in documentary stamp taxes are paid shall be considered
sales. All sales shall be deemed to be arm's length transactions unless
determined to be otherwise under professionally accepted mass appraisal
techniques. The Department of Revenue shall not overturn a determination made
by a county assessor regarding the qualification of a sale unless the
department reviews the sale and determines through the review that the
determination made by the county assessor is incorrect.
(3) The Property Tax Administrator annually shall make and issue
comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of assessment, the
degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall compliance with assessment
requirements for each major class of real property subject to the property tax
in each county. The comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be developed
in compliance with professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques and shall
employ such statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The
comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file as
developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the Property
Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and quality of
assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property Tax
Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by section
79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in establishing
assessed valuations.
(4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural and
horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections 77-1343 to
77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make and issue a
comprehensive study developed in compliance with professionally accepted mass
appraisal techniques to establish the level of value if in his or her opinion
the level of value cannot be developed through the use of the comprehensive
assessment ratio studies developed in subsection (3) of this section.
(5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically
report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property
assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the
Property Tax Administrator shall deem appropriate. The Property Tax
Administrator shall so construct and maintain the system used to collect and
analyze the data to enable him or her to make intracounty comparisons of
assessed valuation, including school districts and other political
subdivisions, as well as intercounty comparisons of assessed valuation,
including school districts and other political subdivisions. The Property Tax
Administrator shall include analysis of real property sales pursuant to land
contracts and similar transfers at the time of execution of the contract or
similar transfer.
Sec. 9. Original sections 29-2260, 76-901, 76-903, and 77-1327, Reissue
Revised Statutes of Nebraska, are repealed.
