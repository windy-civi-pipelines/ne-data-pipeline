AMENDMENTS TO LB78
Introduced by Guereca, 7.
1 1. Insert the following new section:
2 Sec. 5. Section 29-2260, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 29-2260 (1) Whenever a person is adjudicated to be as described in
5 subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247, his or her
6 disposition shall be governed by the Nebraska Juvenile Code.
7 (2) Whenever a court considers sentence for an offender convicted of
8 either a misdemeanor or a felony for which mandatory or mandatory minimum
9 imprisonment is not specifically required, the court may withhold
10 sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the nature and
11 circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of
12 the offender, the court finds that imprisonment of the offender is
13 necessary for protection of the public because:
14 (a) The risk is substantial that during the period of probation the
15 offender will engage in additional criminal conduct;
16 (b) The offender is in need of correctional treatment that can be
17 provided most effectively by commitment to a correctional facility; or
18 (c) A lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the
19 offender's crime or promote disrespect for law.
20 (3) The following grounds, while not controlling the discretion of
21 the court, shall be accorded weight in favor of withholding sentence of
22 imprisonment:
23 (a) The crime neither caused nor threatened serious harm;
24 (b) The offender did not contemplate that his or her crime would
25 cause or threaten serious harm;
26 (c) The offender acted under strong provocation;
27 (d) Substantial grounds were present tending to excuse or justify
