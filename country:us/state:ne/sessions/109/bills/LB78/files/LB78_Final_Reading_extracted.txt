18 interest in or legal title to real estate at the rate of two dollars and
19 thirty-two twenty-five cents for each one thousand dollars value or
20 fraction thereof. For purposes of sections 76-901 to 76-908, value means
21 (1) in the case of any deed, not a gift, the amount of the full actual
22 consideration thereof, paid or to be paid, including the amount of any
23 lien or liens assumed, and (2) in the case of a gift or any deed with
24 nominal consideration or without stated consideration, the current market
25 value of the property transferred. Such tax shall be evidenced by stamps
26 to be attached to the deed. All deeds purporting to transfer legal title
27 or beneficial interest shall be presumed taxable unless it clearly
28 appears on the face of the deed or sufficient documentary proof is
29 presented to the register of deeds that the instrument is exempt under
30 section 76-902.
31 Sec. 7. Section 76-903, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
-5-
LB78 LB78
2025 2025
1 amended to read:
2 76-903 The Tax Commissioner shall design such stamps in such
3 denominations as in his or her judgment will be the most advantageous to
4 all persons concerned. When any deed subject to the tax imposed by
5 section 76-901 is offered for recordation, the register of deeds shall
6 ascertain and compute the amount of the tax due thereon and shall collect
7 such amount as a prerequisite to acceptance of the deed for recordation.
8 If a dispute arises concerning the taxability of the transfer, the
9 register of deeds shall not record the deed until the disputed tax is
10 paid. If a disputed tax has been paid, the taxpayer may file for a refund
11 pursuant to section 76-908. The taxpayer may also seek a declaratory
12 ruling pursuant to rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the
13 Department of Revenue. From each two dollars and thirty-two twenty-five
14 cents of tax collected pursuant to section 76-901, the register of deeds
15 shall retain fifty cents to be placed in the county general fund and
16 shall remit the balance to the State Treasurer who shall credit ninety-
17 five cents of such amount to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, twenty-
18 five cents of such amount to the Site and Building Development Fund,
19 twenty-five cents of such amount to the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust

21 Fund, and seven cents of such amount to the Domestic Violence and Sex
22 Trafficking Survivor Housing Assistance Fund.
23 Sec. 8. Section 77-1327, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 77-1327 (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that accurate and
26 comprehensive information be developed by the Property Tax Administrator
27 and made accessible to the taxing officials and property owners in order
28 to ensure the uniformity and proportionality of the assessments of real
29 property valuations in the state in accordance with law and to provide
30 the statistical and narrative reports pursuant to section 77-5027.
31 (2) All transactions of real property for which the statement
-6-
LB78 LB78
2025 2025
1 required in section 76-214 is filed shall be available for development of
2 a sales file by the Property Tax Administrator. All transactions with
3 stated consideration of more than one hundred dollars or upon which more
4 than two dollars and thirty-two twenty-five cents in documentary stamp
5 taxes are paid shall be considered sales. All sales shall be deemed to be
6 arm's length transactions unless determined to be otherwise under
7 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques. The Department of
8 Revenue shall not overturn a determination made by a county assessor
9 regarding the qualification of a sale unless the department reviews the
10 sale and determines through the review that the determination made by the
11 county assessor is incorrect.
12 (3) The Property Tax Administrator annually shall make and issue
13 comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of
14 assessment, the degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall
15 compliance with assessment requirements for each major class of real
16 property subject to the property tax in each county. The comprehensive
17 assessment ratio studies shall be developed in compliance with
18 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques and shall employ such
19 statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
20 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The
21 comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file
22 as developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the
23 Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and
24 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property
25 Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by
26 section 79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in
27 establishing assessed valuations.
28 (4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural
29 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections
30 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make
31 and issue a comprehensive study developed in compliance with
-7-
LB78 LB78
2025 2025
1 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques to establish the level
2 of value if in his or her opinion the level of value cannot be developed
3 through the use of the comprehensive assessment ratio studies developed
4 in subsection (3) of this section.
5 (5) County assessors and other taxing officials shall electronically
6 report data on the assessed valuation and other features of the property
7 assessment process for such periods and in such form and content as the
8 Property Tax Administrator shall deem appropriate. The Property Tax
9 Administrator shall so construct and maintain the system used to collect
10 and analyze the data to enable him or her to make intracounty comparisons
11 of assessed valuation, including school districts and other political
12 subdivisions, as well as intercounty comparisons of assessed valuation,
13 including school districts and other political subdivisions. The Property
14 Tax Administrator shall include analysis of real property sales pursuant
15 to land contracts and similar transfers at the time of execution of the
16 contract or similar transfer.
17 Sec. 9. Original sections 29-2260, 76-901, 76-903, and 77-1327,
18 Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, are repealed.

14 cents of tax collected pursuant to section 76-901, the register of deeds
15 shall retain fifty cents to be placed in the county general fund and

4 than two dollars and thirty-two twenty-five cents in documentary stamp
5 taxes are paid shall be considered sales. All sales shall be deemed to be
6 arm's length transactions unless determined to be otherwise under
7 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques. The Department of
8 Revenue shall not overturn a determination made by a county assessor
9 regarding the qualification of a sale unless the department reviews the
10 sale and determines through the review that the determination made by the
11 county assessor is incorrect.
12 (3) The Property Tax Administrator annually shall make and issue
13 comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of
14 assessment, the degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall
15 compliance with assessment requirements for each major class of real
16 property subject to the property tax in each county. The comprehensive
17 assessment ratio studies shall be developed in compliance with
18 professionally accepted mass appraisal techniques and shall employ such
19 statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
20 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The
21 comprehensive assessment ratio studies shall be based upon the sales file
22 as developed in subsection (2) of this section and shall be used by the
23 Property Tax Administrator for the analysis of the level of value and
24 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property
25 Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by
26 section 79-1016. Such studies may also be used by assessing officials in
27 establishing assessed valuations.
28 (4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural
29 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections
30 77-1343 to 77-1347.01, the Property Tax Administrator shall annually make
