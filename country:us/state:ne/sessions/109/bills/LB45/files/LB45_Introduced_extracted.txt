10 program offered by the grant recipient. If available, the department may

13 to expand training and mentorship opportunities. The department shall
14 review the reports prior to awarding any future grants to make sure that
15 the grant funds are used appropriately and to measure the effectiveness
16 and impact of the grant program. Following the submission of annual
17 reports, the department shall provide feedback to each grant recipient,
18 highlighting areas of strength and areas for potential improvement based
19 on program performance data. The department shall compile an annual
20 report of best practices from high-performing grant recipients and
