1 amended to read:
2 81-2224 The department shall reimburse each designated area agency
3 on aging for seventy-five percent of the actual cost of providing
4 eligible activities and services as defined in section 81-2222. Such
5 reimbursement shall be made from (1) state funds appropriated by the
6 Legislature, including, but not limited to, cash fund appropriations as
7 described in section 2 of this act, (2) federal funds allocated to the
8 department, including federal funds allocated under the Older Americans
9 Act, as now or hereafter amended, and (3) other funds as available. The
10 payments shall be made by the department on or before the twentieth day

13 plan and budget for each designated area agency on aging, the
14 reimbursement to each area agency on aging shall be proportionately
15 reduced. If an area agency on aging chooses to exceed the budget approved
16 by the department, costs in excess of the approved budget shall not be
17 reimbursed by the department.
