not limited to, cash fund appropriations as described in section 2 of this act,
(2) federal funds allocated to the department, including federal funds
allocated under the Older Americans Act, as now or hereafter amended, and (3)

department-approved plan and budget for each designated area agency on aging,
the reimbursement to each area agency on aging shall be proportionately
reduced. If an area agency on aging chooses to exceed the budget approved by
the department, costs in excess of the approved budget shall not be reimbursed
by the department.
