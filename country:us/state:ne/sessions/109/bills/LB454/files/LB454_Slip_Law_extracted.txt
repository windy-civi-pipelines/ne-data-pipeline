enrollment standards, (b) is enrolled as a network provider with the department
and a regional behavioral health authority, and (c) is contracted with a

of such money, to regional behavioral health authorities for acquisition or
rehabilitation of housing to assist such persons. The division shall manage and
distribute such funds based upon a formula established by the division, in
consultation with regional behavioral health authorities and the department, in
a manner consistent with and reasonably calculated to promote the purposes of
the public behavioral health system enumerated in section 71-803. The division
shall contract with each regional behavioral health authority for the provision
of such assistance. Each regional behavioral health authority may contract with
qualifying public, private, or nonprofit entities for the provision of such
assistance.
(b) For purposes of this subsection:
(i) Adult with serious mental illness means a person eighteen years of age
or older who has, or at any time during the immediately preceding twelve months
has had, a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of sufficient
duration to meet diagnostic criteria identified in the most recent edition of

payments, security and utility deposits, landlord risk mitigation payments, and
