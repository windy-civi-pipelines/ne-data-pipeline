1 Section 1. Section 13-3202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 13-3202 The Legislature finds that:
4 (1) Energy efficiency, grid resiliency, and the use of renewable
5 energy are important for preserving the health and economic well-being of
6 Nebraska’s citizens. Using less energy decreases the cost of living and
7 keeps the cost of public power low by delaying the need for additional
8 power plants. By building the market for energy efficiency, grid
9 resiliency, and renewable energy products, economic development will be
10 encouraged and new jobs will be created for Nebraskans in the energy
11 efficiency, grid resiliency, and renewable energy job sectors;
12 (2) To further these goals, the state should promote energy
13 efficiency improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable
14 energy systems;
15 (3) The upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements, grid
16 resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems prohibit many
17 property owners from making improvements. Therefore, it is necessary to
18 authorize municipalities to implement an alternative financing method
19 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts; and
20 (4) Public purposes will be served by providing municipalities with
21 the authority to finance the installation of energy efficiency
22 improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems
23 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts. Such public
24 purposes include, but are not limited to, reduced energy and water costs,
25 reduced greenhouse gas emissions, economic stimulation and development,
26 improved property valuation, and increased employment.
27 Sec. 2. Section 13-3203, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 13-3203 For purposes of the Property Assessed Clean Energy Act:

24 Sec. 6. Section 18-2102, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 18-2102 It is hereby found and declared that there exist in cities
27 of all classes and villages of this state areas which have deteriorated
28 and become substandard and blighted because of the unsafe, insanitary,
29 inadequate, or overcrowded condition of the dwellings therein, or because
30 of inadequate planning of the area, or excessive land coverage by the
31 buildings thereon, or the lack of proper light and air and open space, or
-9-
LB288 LB288
2025 2025
1 because of the defective design and arrangement of the buildings thereon,
2 or faulty street or lot layout, or congested traffic conditions, or
3 economically or socially undesirable land uses, or the lack of affordable
4 housing in the area. Such conditions or a combination of some or all of
5 them have resulted and will continue to result in making such areas
6 economic or social liabilities harmful to the social and economic well-
7 being of the entire communities in which they exist, needlessly
8 increasing public expenditures, imposing onerous municipal burdens,
9 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, substantially impairing or
10 arresting the sound growth of municipalities, aggravating traffic
11 problems, substantially impairing or arresting the elimination of traffic
12 hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities, and depreciating
13 general community-wide values. The existence of such areas contributes
14 substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime,
15 necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
16 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
17 prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment and the treatment of
18 juvenile delinquency, and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire,
19 and accident protection and other public services and facilities. These
20 conditions are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory process in
21 the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by
22 the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids herein
23 provided. The elimination of such conditions and the acquisition and
24 preparation of land in or necessary to the renewal of substandard and
25 blighted areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in
26 accordance with general plans and redevelopment plans of communities and
27 any assistance which may be given by any state public body in connection
28 therewith are public uses and purposes for which public money may be
29 expended and private property acquired. The necessity in the public
30 interest for the provisions of the Community Development Law is hereby
31 declared to be a matter of legislative determination.
-10-
LB288 LB288
2025 2025
1 It is further found and declared that the prevention and elimination
2 of blight is a matter of state policy, public interest, and statewide
3 concern and within the powers and authority inhering in and reserved to
4 the state, in order that the state and its municipalities shall not
5 continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease,
6 promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of
7 their revenue.
8 It is further found and declared that certain substandard and
9 blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance,
10 and disposition, subject to use restrictions, as provided in the
11 Community Development Law, since the prevailing conditions of decay may
12 make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or
13 rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the
14 means provided in the Community Development Law, be susceptible of
15 conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and
16 evils, hereinbefore enumerated, may be eliminated, remedied, or
17 prevented; and that salvageable substandard and blighted areas can be
18 conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action and the
19 cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in
20 such areas.
21 Sec. 7. Section 18-2103, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,

10 improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special assessment
11 delinquency exceeding the fair value of the land, defective or unusual
12 conditions of title, improper subdivision, or obsolete or no platting, or
13 the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by fire and
14 other causes, or any combination of such factors, substantially impairs

1 Section 1. Section 13-3202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 13-3202 The Legislature finds that:
4 (1) Energy efficiency, grid resiliency, and the use of renewable
5 energy are important for preserving the health and economic well-being of
6 Nebraska’s citizens. Using less energy decreases the cost of living and
7 keeps the cost of public power low by delaying the need for additional
8 power plants. By building the market for energy efficiency, grid
9 resiliency, and renewable energy products, economic development will be
10 encouraged and new jobs will be created for Nebraskans in the energy
11 efficiency, grid resiliency, and renewable energy job sectors;
12 (2) To further these goals, the state should promote energy
13 efficiency improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable
14 energy systems;
15 (3) The upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements, grid
16 resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems prohibit many
17 property owners from making improvements. Therefore, it is necessary to
18 authorize municipalities to implement an alternative financing method
19 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts; and
20 (4) Public purposes will be served by providing municipalities with
21 the authority to finance the installation of energy efficiency
22 improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems
23 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts. Such public
24 purposes include, but are not limited to, reduced energy and water costs,
25 reduced greenhouse gas emissions, economic stimulation and development,
26 improved property valuation, and increased employment.
27 Sec. 2. Section 13-3203, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 13-3203 For purposes of the Property Assessed Clean Energy Act:
30 (1) Assessment contract means a contract entered into between a
31 municipality, a property owner, and, if applicable, a third-party lender
-2-

LB288 LB288
2025 2025
1 under which the municipality agrees to provide financing for an energy
2 project in exchange for a property owner’s agreement to pay an annual
3 assessment for a period not to exceed the weighted average useful life of
4 the energy project;
5 (2) Clean energy assessment district means a district created by a
6 municipality to provide financing for energy projects;
7 (3) Energy efficiency improvement means any acquisition,
8 installation, or modification benefiting publicly or privately owned
9 property that is designed to reduce the electric, gas, water, or other
10 utility demand or consumption of the buildings on, or to be constructed
11 on, such property or to promote the efficient and effective management of
12 natural resources or storm water, including, but not limited to:
13 (a) Insulation in walls, roofs, floors, foundations, or heating and
14 cooling distribution systems;
15 (b) Storm windows and doors; multiglazed windows and doors; heat-
16 absorbing or heat-reflective glazed and coated window and door systems;
17 and additional glazing, reductions in glass area, and other window and
18 door system modifications that reduce energy consumption;
19 (c) Automated energy control systems;
20 (d) Heating, ventilating, or air conditioning and distribution
21 system modifications or replacements;
22 (e) Caulking, weatherstripping, and air sealing;
23 (f) Replacement or modification of lighting fixtures to reduce the
24 energy use of the lighting system;
25 (g) Energy recovery systems, including, but not limited to,
26 cogeneration and trigeneration systems;
27 (h) Daylighting systems;
28 (i) Installation or upgrade of electrical wiring or outlets to
29 charge a motor vehicle that is fully or partially powered by electricity;
30 (j) Facilities providing for water conservation or pollutant
31 control;
-3-

LB288 LB288
2025 2025
1 (k) Roofs designed to reduce energy consumption or support
2 additional loads necessitated by other energy efficiency improvements;
3 (l) Installation of energy-efficient fixtures, including, but not
4 limited to, water heating systems, escalators, and elevators;
5 (m) Energy efficiency related items if so long as the cost of the
6 energy efficiency related items financed by the municipality does not
7 exceed twenty-five percent of the total cost of the energy project; and
8 (n) Any other installation or modification of equipment, devices, or
9 materials approved as a utility cost-saving measure by the municipality;
10 (4) Energy efficiency related item means any repair, replacement,
11 improvement, or modification to real property that is necessary or
12 desirable in conjunction with an energy efficiency improvement,
13 including, but not limited to, structural support improvements and the
14 repair or replacement of any building components, paved surfaces, or
15 fixtures disrupted or altered by the installation of an energy efficiency
16 improvement;
17 (5) Energy project means the installation or modification of an
18 energy efficiency improvement or grid resiliency improvement or the
19 acquisition, installation, or improvement of a renewable energy system;
20 (6) Grid resiliency improvement means any acquisition, installation,
21 or modification benefiting publicly or privately owned property that is
22 designed to anticipate, prepare for, withstand, respond to, and rapidly
23 recover from major power disruptions, including, but not limited to:
24 (a) Backup power generators;
25 (b) Backup power generators powered by renewable energy resources;

24 Sec. 6. Section 18-2102, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 18-2102 It is hereby found and declared that there exist in cities
27 of all classes and villages of this state areas which have deteriorated
28 and become substandard and blighted because of the unsafe, insanitary,
29 inadequate, or overcrowded condition of the dwellings therein, or because
30 of inadequate planning of the area, or excessive land coverage by the
31 buildings thereon, or the lack of proper light and air and open space, or
-9-

LB288 LB288
2025 2025
1 because of the defective design and arrangement of the buildings thereon,
2 or faulty street or lot layout, or congested traffic conditions, or
3 economically or socially undesirable land uses, or the lack of affordable
4 housing in the area. Such conditions or a combination of some or all of
5 them have resulted and will continue to result in making such areas
6 economic or social liabilities harmful to the social and economic well-
7 being of the entire communities in which they exist, needlessly
8 increasing public expenditures, imposing onerous municipal burdens,
9 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, substantially impairing or
10 arresting the sound growth of municipalities, aggravating traffic
11 problems, substantially impairing or arresting the elimination of traffic
12 hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities, and depreciating
13 general community-wide values. The existence of such areas contributes
14 substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime,
15 necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
16 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
17 prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment and the treatment of
18 juvenile delinquency, and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire,
19 and accident protection and other public services and facilities. These
20 conditions are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory process in
21 the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by
22 the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids herein
23 provided. The elimination of such conditions and the acquisition and
24 preparation of land in or necessary to the renewal of substandard and
25 blighted areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in
26 accordance with general plans and redevelopment plans of communities and
27 any assistance which may be given by any state public body in connection
28 therewith are public uses and purposes for which public money may be
29 expended and private property acquired. The necessity in the public
30 interest for the provisions of the Community Development Law is hereby
31 declared to be a matter of legislative determination.
-10-

LB288 LB288
2025 2025
1 It is further found and declared that the prevention and elimination
2 of blight is a matter of state policy, public interest, and statewide
3 concern and within the powers and authority inhering in and reserved to
4 the state, in order that the state and its municipalities shall not
5 continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease,
6 promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of
7 their revenue.
8 It is further found and declared that certain substandard and
9 blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance,
10 and disposition, subject to use restrictions, as provided in the
11 Community Development Law, since the prevailing conditions of decay may
12 make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or
13 rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the
14 means provided in the Community Development Law, be susceptible of
15 conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and
16 evils, hereinbefore enumerated, may be eliminated, remedied, or
17 prevented; and that salvageable substandard and blighted areas can be
18 conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action and the
19 cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in
20 such areas.
