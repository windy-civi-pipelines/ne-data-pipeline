E AND R AMENDMENTS TO LB 288
Introduced by Guereca, 7, Chairman Enrollment and Review
1 1. Strike the original sections and all amendments thereto and
2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Section 13-3202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 13-3202 The Legislature finds that:
6 (1) Energy efficiency, grid resiliency, and the use of renewable
7 energy are important for preserving the health and economic well-being of
8 Nebraska’s citizens. Using less energy decreases the cost of living and
9 keeps the cost of public power low by delaying the need for additional
10 power plants. By building the market for energy efficiency, grid
11 resiliency, and renewable energy products, economic development will be
12 encouraged and new jobs will be created for Nebraskans in the energy
13 efficiency, grid resiliency, and renewable energy job sectors;
14 (2) To further these goals, the state should promote energy
15 efficiency improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable
16 energy systems;
17 (3) The upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements, grid
18 resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems prohibit many
19 property owners from making improvements. Therefore, it is necessary to
20 authorize municipalities to implement an alternative financing method
21 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts; and
22 (4) Public purposes will be served by providing municipalities with
23 the authority to finance the installation of energy efficiency
24 improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems
25 through the creation of clean energy assessment districts. Such public
26 purposes include, but are not limited to, reduced energy and water costs,
27 reduced greenhouse gas emissions, economic stimulation and development,

JNH - 04/28/2025 JNH - 04/28/2025
1 18-2102 It is hereby found and declared that there exist in cities
2 of all classes and villages of this state areas which have deteriorated
3 and become substandard and blighted because of the unsafe, insanitary,
4 inadequate, or overcrowded condition of the dwellings therein, or because
5 of inadequate planning of the area, or excessive land coverage by the
6 buildings thereon, or the lack of proper light and air and open space, or
7 because of the defective design and arrangement of the buildings thereon,
8 or faulty street or lot layout, or congested traffic conditions, or
9 economically or socially undesirable land uses, or the lack of affordable
10 housing in the area. Such conditions or a combination of some or all of
11 them have resulted and will continue to result in making such areas
12 economic or social liabilities harmful to the social and economic well-
13 being of the entire communities in which they exist, needlessly
14 increasing public expenditures, imposing onerous municipal burdens,
15 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, substantially impairing or
16 arresting the sound growth of municipalities, aggravating traffic
17 problems, substantially impairing or arresting the elimination of traffic
18 hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities, and depreciating
19 general community-wide values. The existence of such areas contributes
20 substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime,
21 necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
22 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
23 prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment and the treatment of
24 juvenile delinquency, and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire,
25 and accident protection and other public services and facilities. These
26 conditions are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory process in
27 the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by
28 the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids herein
29 provided. The elimination of such conditions and the acquisition and
30 preparation of land in or necessary to the renewal of substandard and
31 blighted areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in
-9-

LB288 LB288
JNH - 04/28/2025 JNH - 04/28/2025
1 accordance with general plans and redevelopment plans of communities and
2 any assistance which may be given by any state public body in connection
3 therewith are public uses and purposes for which public money may be
4 expended and private property acquired. The necessity in the public
5 interest for the provisions of the Community Development Law is hereby
6 declared to be a matter of legislative determination.
7 It is further found and declared that the prevention and elimination
8 of blight is a matter of state policy, public interest, and statewide
9 concern and within the powers and authority inhering in and reserved to
10 the state, in order that the state and its municipalities shall not
11 continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease,
12 promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of
13 their revenue.
14 It is further found and declared that certain substandard and
15 blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance,
16 and disposition, subject to use restrictions, as provided in the
17 Community Development Law, since the prevailing conditions of decay may
18 make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or
19 rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the
20 means provided in the Community Development Law, be susceptible of
21 conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and
22 evils, hereinbefore enumerated, may be eliminated, remedied, or
23 prevented; and that salvageable substandard and blighted areas can be
24 conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action and the
25 cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in
26 such areas.
27 Sec. 7. Section 18-2103, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
28 2024, is amended to read:
29 18-2103 For purposes of the Community Development Law, unless the
