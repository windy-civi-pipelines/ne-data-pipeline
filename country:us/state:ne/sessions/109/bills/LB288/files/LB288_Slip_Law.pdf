Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Section 13-3202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
13-3202 The Legislature finds that:
(1) Energy efficiency, grid resiliency, and the use of renewable energy
are important for preserving the health and economic well-being of Nebraska’s
citizens. Using less energy decreases the cost of living and keeps the cost of
public power low by delaying the need for additional power plants. By building
the market for energy efficiency, grid resiliency, and renewable energy
products, economic development will be encouraged and new jobs will be created
for Nebraskans in the energy efficiency, grid resiliency, and renewable energy
job sectors;
(2) To further these goals, the state should promote energy efficiency
improvements, grid resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems;
(3) The upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements, grid resiliency
improvements, and renewable energy systems prohibit many property owners from
making improvements. Therefore, it is necessary to authorize municipalities to
implement an alternative financing method through the creation of clean energy
assessment districts; and
(4) Public purposes will be served by providing municipalities with the
authority to finance the installation of energy efficiency improvements, grid
resiliency improvements, and renewable energy systems through the creation of
clean energy assessment districts. Such public purposes include, but are not
limited to, reduced energy and water costs, reduced greenhouse gas emissions,
economic stimulation and development, improved property valuation, and
increased employment.

municipality, a property owner, and, if applicable, a third-party lender under
which the municipality agrees to provide financing for an energy project in
exchange for a property owner’s agreement to pay an annual assessment for a
period not to exceed the weighted average useful life of the energy project;
(2) Clean energy assessment district means a district created by a
municipality to provide financing for energy projects;
(3) Energy efficiency improvement means any acquisition, installation, or

to reduce the electric, gas, water, or other utility demand or consumption of
the buildings on, or to be constructed on, such property or to promote the
efficient and effective management of natural resources or storm water,
including, but not limited to:
(a) Insulation in walls, roofs, floors, foundations, or heating and
cooling distribution systems;

(6) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Community Development Law,
the designation of an area as an extremely blighted area pursuant to this
section shall be valid for a period of no less than twenty-five years from the

Sec. 6. Section 18-2102, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
18-2102 It is hereby found and declared that there exist in cities of all
classes and villages of this state areas which have deteriorated and become
substandard and blighted because of the unsafe, insanitary, inadequate, or
overcrowded condition of the dwellings therein, or because of inadequate
planning of the area, or excessive land coverage by the buildings thereon, or
the lack of proper light and air and open space, or because of the defective
design and arrangement of the buildings thereon, or faulty street or lot
layout, or congested traffic conditions, or economically or socially
undesirable land uses, or the lack of affordable housing in the area. Such
conditions or a combination of some or all of them have resulted and will
continue to result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful
to the social and economic well-being of the entire communities in which they
exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing onerous municipal
burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, substantially impairing
or arresting the sound growth of municipalities, aggravating traffic problems,
substantially impairing or arresting the elimination of traffic hazards and the
improvement of traffic facilities, and depreciating general community-wide
values. The existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly
to the spread of disease and crime, necessitating excessive and
disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution,
punishment and the treatment of juvenile delinquency, and for the maintenance
of adequate police, fire, and accident protection and other public services and
facilities. These conditions are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
process in the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with
effectively by the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids
herein provided. The elimination of such conditions and the acquisition and
preparation of land in or necessary to the renewal of substandard and blighted
areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in accordance with
general plans and redevelopment plans of communities and any assistance which
may be given by any state public body in connection therewith are public uses
and purposes for which public money may be expended and private property
acquired. The necessity in the public interest for the provisions of the
Community Development Law is hereby declared to be a matter of legislative
determination.
It is further found and declared that the prevention and elimination of
blight is a matter of state policy, public interest, and statewide concern and
within the powers and authority inhering in and reserved to the state, in order
that the state and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by
areas which are focal centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency, and
consume an excessive proportion of their revenue.
It is further found and declared that certain substandard and blighted
areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and
disposition, subject to use restrictions, as provided in the Community
Development Law, since the prevailing conditions of decay may make
impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation;
that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in the
Community Development Law, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in
such a manner that the conditions and evils, hereinbefore enumerated, may be
eliminated, remedied, or prevented; and that salvageable substandard and
blighted areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public
action and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of
property in such areas.
Sec. 7. Section 18-2103, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is

platting, or the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by
fire and other causes, or any combination of such factors, substantially
