3 70-650.01 Except as provided in sections 70-1101 to 70-1106,
4 whenever any public power district or public power and irrigation

8 fully paid and redeemed, or have accumulated reserves sufficient for the
9 redemption of, all of the bonds or other obligations of the district
10 evidencing the indebtedness incurred as the cost of construction or the
11 purchase price of its lines, works, and system, then and in that event,
12 whenever any such city or village shall so request, such the said
13 district shall convey without cost all of its right, title, and interest
14 in and to its electric distribution system, as distinguished from its
15 generating plants and transmission lines, to such the said city or
16 village within the territorial limits of which such system is located.
17 The request of such city or village shall be exercised by a resolution

20 been given by the governing body by publication once each week for three
21 successive weeks in some legal newspaper published and of general

7 public power and irrigation district owning the distribution system shall
8 be joined. This section shall not: (1) Prevent the refinancing or
9 changing of the form of the outstanding indebtedness of the district
10 existing on May 4, 1945, where the amount of the outstanding bonds or

12 facilities shall not be increased nor the time of payment extended by any
13 obligations for which the revenue received through the said electric
14 distribution systems is pledged, or (2) prevent the issuance of other and
15 different series of bonds of the district representing the cost of
16 acquisition or construction of additional electric facilities, or the
17 pledging of the revenue of such additional facilities for the payment of
18 such other or further series of bonds, or to prevent the board of
