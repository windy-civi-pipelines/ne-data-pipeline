LB362 LB362
2025 2025
1 the act.
2 Sec. 60. Section 86-435, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 86-435 (1) A local governing body may incur any nonrecurring or
5 recurring charges for the installation, maintenance, and operation of 911
6 service and shall pay such costs out of general funds which may be
7 supplemented by funds from the imposition of a service surcharge. A local
8 governing body incurring costs for 911 service may impose a uniform
9 service surcharge of up to fifty cents per month on each telephone number
10 or functional equivalent of service users whose primary place of use is
11 within the local governing body's 911 service area, except for those
12 service users served by wireless carriers as defined in section 86-456
13 and those service users who have no access to 911 service. The initial
14 service surcharge may be imposed at any time subsequent to the execution
15 of an agreement for 911 service with a service supplier.
16 (2) Except in a county containing a city of the metropolitan class,
17 such uniform service surcharge in subsection (1) of this section may be
18 increased by an additional amount not to exceed fifty cents per month.
19 Such additional increase shall be made only after:
20 (a) Publication of notices for a public hearing. Such notices shall:
21 (i) Be published at least once a week for three consecutive weeks in
22 a legal newspaper published or of general circulation in the areas
23 affected;

25 (iii) Set forth the purpose of the public hearing and the purpose of
26 the increase; and
27 (b) A public hearing is held pursuant to such notices.
28 (3) If 911 service is to be provided for a territory which is
29 included in whole or in part in the jurisdiction of two or more local
30 governing bodies, the agreement for such service shall be entered into by
31 each such local governing body unless any such local governing body
-47-

LB362 LB362
2025 2025
1 expressly excludes itself from the agreement. Such an agreement shall
2 provide that each local governing body which is a customer of 911 service
3 will pay for its portion of the service. Nothing in this subsection shall
4 be construed to prevent two or more local governing bodies from entering
5 into a contract which establishes a separate legal entity for the purpose
6 of entering into such an agreement as the customer of the service
7 supplier or any supplier of equipment for 911 service.
8 (4) If a local governing body's 911 service area includes a local
9 exchange area which intersects governmental boundary lines, the affected
10 governmental units may cooperate to provide 911 service through an
11 agreement as provided in the Interlocal Cooperation Act or the Joint
12 Public Agency Act. The agreement shall provide for the assessment of a
13 uniform service surcharge within a local governing body's 911 service
14 area. The service surcharge on each telephone number or functional
15 equivalent of service users whose primary place of use is within the
16 local governing body's 911 service area, except for those service users
17 served by wireless carriers as defined in section 86-456 and those
18 service users who have no access to 911 service, shall be the same as the
19 amount allowed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.
20 (5) Funds generated by the service surcharge shall be expended only
21 for the purchase, installation, maintenance, and operation of
22 telecommunications equipment and telecommunications-related services
23 required for the provision of 911 service.
24 Sec. 61. Section 86-436, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 86-436 (1) A service user shall pay service surcharges in each 911
27 service area where the service user has its primary place of use and
28 receives 911 service, except that an individual service user shall not be
29 required to pay on a single periodic billing service surcharges on more
30 than one hundred telephone numbers or functional equivalents in any
31 single 911 service area. Every service user shall be liable for any
-48-

LB362 LB362
2025 2025
1 service surcharge billed to such user until the surcharge has been paid
2 to the service supplier.
3 (2) The duty of a service supplier to bill a service surcharge to a
4 service user shall commence at such time as may be specified by the local
5 governing body. A service surcharge shall be collected as far as
6 practicable at the same time as and along with the charges for service in
7 accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.
8 (3) A service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal
9 action to enforce the collection of any service surcharge imposed
10 pursuant to section 60 of this act 86-435. Such action may be brought by
11 or on behalf of the local governing body imposing the charge or the
12 separate legal entity formed pursuant to such section. A service supplier
13 shall annually provide the local governing body a list of the amounts
14 uncollected along with the names and addresses of those service users who
15 carry a balance that can be determined by the service supplier to be for
16 nonpayment of any service surcharge. The service supplier shall not be
17 liable for such uncollected amounts.
18 Sec. 62. Section 86-437, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 86-437 (1) The amount of service surcharges collected in one
21 calendar quarter by a service supplier shall be remitted to the local
22 governing body no later than sixty days after the close of that calendar
23 quarter. At the time of the remittance, the service supplier shall file a
24 return for the remittance with the local governing body in such form as
25 the local governing body and the service supplier agree upon. The service
26 supplier shall maintain a record of the amount of service surcharges
27 collected. The record shall be maintained for a period of one year after
28 the date the amount was billed. A local governing body may at its own
29 expense require an annual audit of a service supplier's books and records
30 concerning the collection and remittance of a service surcharge.
31 (2) On or before April 30 of each year, each service supplier shall

2 Commission for each of its exchanges (a) whether 911 service or E-911

15 Communications Systems Act.
16 Sec. 63. Section 86-438, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 86-438 Each calendar year, the local governing body shall establish
19 the rate of the service surcharge, not to exceed the amount authorized by
20 section 60 of this act 86-435, that together with any surplus revenue
21 carried forward will produce sufficient revenue to fund the expenditures
22 necessary to develop, install, and operate 911 emergency telephone
23 communications systems throughout the state described in section 86-421.
24 Amounts collected in excess of such necessary expenditures within a given
25 year shall be carried forward to the next year. A local governing body
26 shall make its determination of the rate no later than September 1 of
27 each year and, if it is a new rate, shall fix the new rate to take effect
28 commencing with the first billing period of each service user on or
29 following the next January 1. The local governing body shall notify by
30 certified or registered mail every service supplier of any change in the
31 rate at least ninety days before the new rate becomes effective.

7 end of any fiscal year shall remain in the fund for payments during any
8 succeeding year, except that if 911 service is discontinued, money
9 remaining in the fund after payment of all costs related to 911 service
10 have been made shall be transferred to the general fund of the public
11 safety agency or proportionately to the general fund of each
12 participating public safety agency.
13 Sec. 65. Section 86-440, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
