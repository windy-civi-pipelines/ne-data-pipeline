user shall be liable for any service surcharge billed to such user until the
surcharge has been paid to the service supplier.
(2) The duty of a service supplier to bill a service surcharge to a
service user shall commence at such time as may be specified by the local
governing body. A service surcharge shall be collected as far as practicable at
the same time as and along with the charges for service in accordance with the
regular billing practice of the service supplier.
(3) A service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal action
to enforce the collection of any service surcharge imposed pursuant to section
60 of this act 86-435. Such action may be brought by or on behalf of the local
governing body imposing the charge or the separate legal entity formed pursuant
to such section. A service supplier shall annually provide the local governing

the amount of service surcharges collected. The record shall be maintained for
a period of one year after the date the amount was billed. A local governing
body may at its own expense require an annual audit of a service supplier's
books and records concerning the collection and remittance of a service
surcharge.
(2) On or before April 30 of each year, each service supplier shall report
for the preceding calendar year to the commission Public Service Commission for
each of its exchanges (a) whether 911 service or E-911 service is provided in
that exchange, (b) the level of the service surcharge, (c) to which local
governing body the service surcharge is being submitted, and (d) the amount of
revenue collected by the service surcharge.
(3) The commission shall compile and place the information from such
reports required in subsection (2) of this section into its annual

necessary expenditures within a given year shall be carried forward to the next
year. A local governing body shall make its determination of the rate no later
than September 1 of each year and, if it is a new rate, shall fix the new rate
to take effect commencing with the first billing period of each service user on
or following the next January 1. The local governing body shall notify by

shall remain in the fund for payments during any succeeding year, except that
if 911 service is discontinued, money remaining in the fund after payment of
all costs related to 911 service have been made shall be transferred to the
