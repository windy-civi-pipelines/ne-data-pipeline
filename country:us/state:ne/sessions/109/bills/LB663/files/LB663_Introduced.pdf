1 Section 1. Section 23-114.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
2 is amended to read:
3 23-114.01 (1) In order to avail itself of the powers conferred by
4 section 23-114, the county board shall appoint a planning commission to
5 be known as the county planning commission. The members of the commission
6 shall be residents of the county to be planned and shall be appointed
7 with due consideration to geographical and population factors. Since the
8 primary focus of concern and control in county planning and land-use
9 regulatory programs is the unincorporated area, a majority of the members
10 of the commission shall be residents of unincorporated areas, except that
11 this requirement shall not apply to joint planning commissions. Members
12 of the commission shall hold no county or municipal office, except that a
13 member may also be a member of a city, village, or other type of planning
14 commission. The term of each member shall be three years, except that
15 approximately one-third of the members of the first commission shall
16 serve for terms of one year, one-third for terms of two years, and one-
17 third for terms of three years. All members shall hold office until their
18 successors are appointed. Members of the commission may be removed by a
19 majority vote of the county board for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or
20 malfeasance in office or other good and sufficient cause upon written
21 charges being filed with the county board and after a public hearing has
22 been held regarding such charges. Vacancies occurring otherwise than
23 through the expiration of terms shall be filled for the unexpired terms
24 by individuals appointed by the county board. Members of the commission
25 shall be compensated for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in
26 connection with their duties in an amount to be fixed by the county
27 board. Reimbursement for mileage shall be made at the rate provided in
28 section 81-1176. Each county board may provide a per diem payment for
29 members of the commission of not to exceed fifteen dollars for each day
30 that each such member attends meetings of the commission or is engaged in
31 matters concerning the commission, but no member shall receive more than
-2-

2025 2025
1 one thousand dollars in any one year. Such per diem payments shall be in
2 addition to and separate from compensation for expenses.
3 (2) Each member of the commission and the county board shall
4 undertake two hours of education per term on topics specific to the role
5 of the commissioner or board member when addressing matters subject to
6 this section. Such education shall be developed and presented by the
7 respective county attorney.
8 (3) (2) The commission: (a) Shall prepare and adopt as its policy
9 statement a comprehensive development plan and such implemental means as
10 a capital improvement program, subdivision regulations, building codes,
11 and a zoning resolution; (b) shall consult with and advise public
12 officials and agencies, public utilities, civic organizations,
13 educational institutions, and citizens relating to the promulgation of
14 implemental programs; (c) may delegate authority to any of the groups
15 named in subdivision (b) of this subsection to conduct studies and make
16 surveys for the commission; and (d) shall make preliminary reports on its
17 findings and hold public hearings before submitting its final reports.
18 The county board shall not hold its public meetings or take action on
19 matters relating to the comprehensive development plan, capital
20 improvements, building codes, subdivision development, or zoning until it
21 has received the recommendations of the commission.
22 (4)(a) (3) The commission may, with the consent of the governing
23 body, in its own name: (i) Make and enter into contracts with public or
24 private bodies; (ii) receive contributions, bequests, gifts, or grants of
25 funds from public or private sources; (iii) expend the funds appropriated
26 to it by the county board; (iv) employ agents and employees; and (v)
27 acquire, hold, and dispose of property.
28 (b) The commission may, on its own authority: (i) Make arrangements
29 consistent with its program; (ii) conduct or sponsor special studies or
30 planning work for any public body or appropriate agency; (iii) receive
31 grants, remuneration, or reimbursement for such studies or work; and (iv)
-3-

2025 2025
1 at its public hearings, summon witnesses, administer oaths, and compel
2 the giving of testimony.
3 (5)(a) (4) In all counties in the state, the county planning
4 commission may grant conditional uses or special exceptions to property
5 owners for the use of their property if the county board of commissioners
6 or supervisors has officially and generally authorized the commission to
7 exercise such powers and has approved the standards and procedures the
8 commission adopted for equitably and judiciously granting such
9 conditional uses or special exceptions. The granting of a conditional use
10 permit or special exception shall only allow property owners to put their
11 property to a special use if it is among those uses specifically
12 identified in the county zoning regulations as classifications of uses
13 which may require special conditions or requirements to be met by the
14 owners before a use permit or building permit is authorized.
15 (b) The applicant for a conditional use permit or special exception
16 for a livestock operation specifically identified in the county zoning
17 regulations as a classification of use which may require special
18 conditions or requirements to be met within an area of a county zoned for
19 agricultural use may request a determination of the special conditions or
20 requirements to be imposed by the county planning commission or by the
21 county board of commissioners or supervisors if the board has not
22 authorized the commission to exercise such authority. Upon request the
23 commission or board shall issue such determination of the special
24 conditions or requirements to be imposed in a timely manner. Such special
25 conditions or requirements to be imposed may include, but are not limited
26 to, the submission of information that may be separately provided to
27 state or federal agencies in applying to obtain the applicable state and
28 federal permits. Granting a conditional use permit or special exception
29 by the commission or county board shall be based solely on county zoning
30 regulations. Nothing in this section shall be construed to release the
31 applicant from complying with applicable rules and regulations of any
-4-

LB663 LB663
2025 2025
1 local, state, or federal agency or with any applicable state or federal
2 permit requirements. A commission or county board shall not require an
3 applicant for a conditional use permit or special exception to apply for
4 or obtain any other permit from a federal, state, or local agency as a
5 condition for granting such conditional use permit or special exception.
6 The granting of a conditional use permit or special exception by a
7 commission or county board shall not relieve the applicant of any
8 requirement to obtain other necessary permits from any federal, state, or
9 local agency.
10 (c) The commission or the board may request and review, prior to
11 making a determination of the special conditions or requirements to be
12 imposed, reasonable information relevant to the conditional use or
13 special exception. If a determination of the special conditions or
14 requirements to be imposed has been made, final permit approval may be
15 withheld subject only to a final review by the commission or county board
16 to determine whether there is a substantial change in the applicant's
17 proposed use of the property upon which the determination was based and
18 that the applicant has met, or will meet, the special conditions or
19 requirements imposed in the determination. When making the determination
20 as to whether the special use permit application should be approved or
21 denied, the commission and board shall presume that the applicant for the
22 permit will comply with all local, state, and federal requirements. The
23 burden of proof to the contrary shall rest on the party challenging said
24 presumption. Without factual evidence contrary to the application, the
25 commission or board shall approve the application.
26 (d) For purposes of this section, substantial change shall include
27 any significant alteration in the original application including a
28 significant change in the design or location of buildings or facilities,
29 in waste disposal methods or facilities, or in capacity.
30 (6) (5) The power to grant conditional uses or special exceptions as
31 set forth in subsection (5) (4) of this section shall be the exclusive
-5-

LB663 LB663
2025 2025
1 authority of the commission, except that the county board of
2 commissioners or supervisors may choose to retain for itself the power to
3 grant conditional uses or special exceptions for those classifications of
4 uses specified in the county zoning regulations. The county board of
5 commissioners or supervisors may exercise such power if it has formally
6 adopted standards and procedures for granting such conditional uses or
7 special exceptions in a manner that is equitable and which will promote
8 the public interest. In any county other than a county in which is
9 located a city of the primary class, an appeal of a decision by the
10 county planning commission or county board of commissioners or
11 supervisors regarding a conditional use or special exception shall be
12 made to the district court. In any county in which is located a city of
13 the primary class, an appeal of a decision by the county planning
14 commission regarding a conditional use or special exception shall be made
15 to the county board of commissioners or supervisors, and an appeal of a
16 decision by the county board of commissioners or supervisors regarding a
17 conditional use or special exception shall be made to the district court.
18 (7)(a) (6) Whenever a county planning commission or county board is
19 authorized to grant conditional uses or special exceptions pursuant to
20 subsection (5) (4) or (6) (5) of this section, the planning commission or
21 county board shall, with its decision to grant or deny a conditional use
22 permit or special exception, issue a statement of factual findings
23 arising from the record of proceedings that support the granting or
24 denial of the conditional use permit or special exception. If a county
25 planning commission's role is advisory to the county board, the county
26 planning commission shall submit such statement with its recommendation
27 to the county board as to whether to approve or deny a conditional use
28 permit or special exception.
29 (b) Upon receipt of an application, the planning commission shall
30 have thirty days to determine if the application is complete. If the
31 commission determines the application is incomplete, within ten days
-6-

LB663 LB663
2025 2025
1 following such determination, the commission shall notify the applicant
2 in writing as to what information is required to make the application
3 complete. The commission shall have thirty days after receipt of any
4 additional information provided by the applicant to redetermine if the
5 application is complete. Within ninety days after receiving a complete
6 application, the commission shall:
7 (i) If the commission has the authority to grant or deny a
8 conditional use permit or special exception, grant or deny such
9 application; or
10 (ii) If the commission does not have the authority to grant or deny
11 a conditional use permit or special exception, make a recommendation to
12 the board that such application be granted or denied.
13 (c) Once the board has received the recommendation of the
14 commission, the board shall have thirty days to make its own
15 determination if the application is complete. If the board determines the
16 application is incomplete, within ten days following such determination,
17 the board shall notify the applicant in writing as to what information is
18 required to make the application complete. Once the applicant provides
19 the information necessary to complete the application, the board shall
20 have thirty days to determine if the application is complete. Not later
21 than ninety days after receiving a complete application as determined by
22 the board, the board shall decide whether to grant or deny a conditional
23 use permit or special exception.
24 Sec. 2. Original section 23-114.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of
25 Nebraska, is repealed.
