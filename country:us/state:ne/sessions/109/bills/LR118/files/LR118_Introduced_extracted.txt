ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 118
Cavanaugh, M., 6; Clements, 2; DeKay, 40; Dorn, 30; Guereca, 7;

Storm, 23; Wordekemper, 15.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine and formulate a standardized method of classifying and valuing property
relating to biofuel facilities.
The valuation and classification of property, both real property and
improvements, as it pertains to biofuel facilities varies among counties and
assessors in the state, creating inconsistencies in taxation and property
assessments from county to county. These inconsistencies may create financial
burdens on biofuel producers and inhibit further investment and development of
the renewable energy industry.
A more uniform and equitable system for valuing and classifying property
related to biofuel facilities would provide clarity for assessors, entities
funded by property taxes, property owners, and developers and could stimulate
growth in the future of our biofuel sector.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Revenue Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
