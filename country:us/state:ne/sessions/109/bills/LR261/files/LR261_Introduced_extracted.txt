Section 1:
LR261 LR261
2025 2025
ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 261
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the fiscal impact of unfunded, statutorily mandated tuition and fee
waivers on Nebraska's public university, state colleges, community colleges,
and the Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education and to assess the
broader implications of these waivers and the lack of corresponding state
appropriation funding for the lost tuition and fee revenue on students,
institutional budgets, and the state's higher education systems. This study
shall include, but need not be limited to, the examination of:
(1) The financial impact of such unfunded, mandated tuition waivers on
public higher education institutions;
(2) The long-term sustainability of such waivers;
(3) The degree to which such waivers support Nebraska's strategic
workforce development objectives; and
(4) Legislative solutions, including Legislative Bill 307, One Hundred
Ninth Legislature, First Session, 2025, and funding mechanisms to ensure that
such programs do not unduly burden Nebraska's public universities and colleges.
In conducting this interim study, the Appropriations Committee of the
Legislature may create a working group composed of representatives from the
University of Nebraska, state colleges, community colleges, the Coordinating
Commission for Postsecondary Education, the Nebraska Statewide Workforce and
Education Reporting System, and other relevant education and legislative
stakeholders to identify key issues, gather input from affected parties, and
propose potential solutions.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Appropriations Committee of the Legislature shall be
-1-

resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
