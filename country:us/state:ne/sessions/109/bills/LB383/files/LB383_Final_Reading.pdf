8 record owner of the property and who, if anyone, holds an instrument in
9 the nature of a security device which affects the property.
10 (9) If the answer to an inquiry states that the record owner of the
11 property is any person other than the person who was in possession of it

13 forfeiture hearing to a date past the time any criminal action is pending
14 against the owner upon request of any party.
15 (b) If the owner of the property has filed an answer denying that
16 the property is subject to forfeiture, then the burden is on the
17 petitioner to prove that the property is subject to forfeiture. However,
18 if an answer has not been filed by the owner of the property, the
19 petition for forfeiture may be introduced into evidence and is prima
20 facie evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. The burden of
21 proof placed upon the petitioner in regard to property forfeited under

23 (c) At the hearing any claimant of any right, title, or interest in
24 the property may prove his or her lien, encumbrance, security interest,
25 other interest in the nature of a security interest, mortgage, or deed of
26 trust to be bona fide and created without actual knowledge or consent
27 that the property was to be used so as to cause the property to be
28 subject to forfeiture.
29 (d) If it is found that the property is subject to forfeiture, then
30 the judge shall forfeit the property. However, if proof at the hearing
31 discloses that the interest of any bona fide lienholder, any secured
-16-

LB383 LB383
2025 2025
1 party, any other person holding an interest in the property in the nature
2 of a security interest, or any holder of a bona fide encumbrance,
3 mortgage, or deed of trust is greater than or equal to the present value
4 of the property, the court shall order the property released to him or
5 her. If the interest is less than the present value of the property and
6 if the proof shows that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court
7 shall order the property forfeited.
8 (13) Unless otherwise provided in this section, all personal
9 property which is forfeited under this section shall be liquidated and,
10 after deduction of court costs and the expense of liquidation, the
11 proceeds shall be remitted to the county treasurer of the county in which
12 the seizure was made. The county treasurer shall remit all such proceeds
13 from property forfeited pursuant to this section to the State Treasurer
14 for distribution in accordance with Article VII, section 5, of the
15 Constitution of Nebraska.
16 (14) All money forfeited under this section shall be remitted in the
17 same manner as provided in subsection (13) of this section.
18 (15) All real estate forfeited under this section shall be sold to
19 the highest bidder at a public auction for cash, the auction to be
20 conducted by the county sheriff or his or her designee at such place, on
21 such notice, and in accordance with the same procedure, as far as
22 practicable, as is required in the case of sales of land under execution
23 at law. The proceeds of the sale shall first be applied to the cost and
24 expense in administering and conducting the sale, then to the
25 satisfaction of all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, and encumbrances of
26 record on the property. The remaining proceeds shall be remitted in the
27 same manner as provided in subsection (13) of this section.
28 (16) The forfeiture procedure set forth in this section is the sole
29 remedy of any claimant, and no court shall have jurisdiction to interfere
30 therewith by replevin, by injunction, by supersedeas, or by any other
31 manner.
