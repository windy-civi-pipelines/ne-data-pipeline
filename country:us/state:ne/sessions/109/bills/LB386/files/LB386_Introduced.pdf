1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current
5 mental health system, including a shortage of mental health care
6 professionals and long travel distances to receive care. These issues
7 have had a negative impact on those suffering from mental health issues
8 and their communities, particularly in rural parts of the state;
9 (2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
10 crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to
11 respond and take the individual into emergency protective custody until
12 the individual can be transported to an available mental health treatment
13 facility. This places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies,
14 particularly in rural parts of the state, which is compounded by the
15 shortage of mental health bed space and long travel distances to
16 facilities;
17 (3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and
18 the state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the
19 negative impact of mental health issues on individuals and law
20 enforcement agencies;
21 (4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
22 communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
23 efficiently and cost-effectively; and
24 (5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of
25 cooperation and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those
26 suffering from mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that
27 interact with them.
28 Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
29 Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
30 provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental
31 health beds and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to
-2-

LB386 LB386
2025 2025
1 service the region.
2 (2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate
3 a method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to
4 address the impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those
5 suffering from mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that
6 can be replicated statewide.
7 (3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency
8 for the pilot program. The selected agency shall:
9 (a) Have an existing jail facility with the capacity to add mental
10 health beds, either at that facility or elsewhere;
11 (b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement
12 agencies;
13 (c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
14 additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues
15 and law enforcement agencies; and
16 (d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies
17 through a memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds
18 provide a regional benefit.
19 (4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health
20 Expansion Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result
21 in the incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing
22 in the act should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is
23 to expand mental health services provided by law enforcement agencies to
24 individuals temporarily in custody for mental health issues.
25 Sec. 4. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
26 Justice shall administer the pilot program and, in addition to the
27 requirements set out in section 3 of this act, develop grant eligibility,
28 application, and audit requirements.
29 (2) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
30 carry out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
31 (3) The commission shall identify grant funding to carry out the

1 (b) The clerk shall issue the warrant of the board directed to the
2 sheriff of the county for the arrest and detention of such person. Such

21 seize and detain such person when the peace officer has probable cause to
22 believe that the person is reported to be absent without authorization as
23 described in this section. Such person shall be returned to the treatment
24 facility or program or shall be taken to a facility or jail as described
25 in section 71-919 until he or she can be returned to such treatment
26 facility or program.
