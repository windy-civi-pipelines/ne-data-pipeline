AMENDMENTS TO LB 179
Introduced by Juarez, 5.
1 1. Strike the original sections and insert the following new
2 sections:
3 Section 1. Section 16-1005, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 16-1005 (1)(a)(i) Prior to October 1, 2025 (1) Until October 1,
6 2013, each police officer shall contribute to the retirement system a sum
7 equal to six percent of his or her salary. Beginning October 1, 2013,
8 until October 1, 2015, each police officer shall contribute to the
9 retirement system a sum equal to six and one-half percent of his or her
10 salary. Beginning October 1, 2015, each police officer shall contribute
11 to the retirement system a sum equal to seven percent of his or her
12 salary.
13 (ii) Beginning October 1, 2025, each police officer shall contribute
14 to the retirement system a sum equal to nine percent of his or her
15 salary.
16 (b) Such payment under subdivision (a) of this subsection shall be
17 made by regular payroll deductions from the police officer's periodic
18 salary and shall be credited to his or her employee account on a monthly
19 basis.
20 (c) Each such account shall also be credited with regular interest.
21 (2) Each city of the first class shall pick up the police officers'
22 contributions required by subsection (1) of this section, and the
23 contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions in
24 determining federal tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, except
25 that the city shall continue to withhold federal income taxes based upon
26 these contributions until the Internal Revenue Service or the federal
27 courts rule that, pursuant to section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue
-1-

1 Code, these contributions shall not be included as gross income of the
2 employee until such time as they are distributed from the retirement
3 system. The city shall pay these employee contributions from the same
4 source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the employee. The
5 city shall pick up these contributions by a salary deduction either
6 through a reduction in the cash salary of the employee or a combination
7 of a reduction in salary and offset against a future salary increase. A
8 police officer shall not be given an option to choose to receive the
9 amount of the required contribution in lieu of having such contribution
10 paid directly to the retirement system.
11 (3) Each police officer shall be entitled to make voluntary cash
12 contributions to the retirement system in an amount not to exceed the
13 contribution limitations established by the Internal Revenue Code.
14 Voluntary contributions shall be credited to the police officer's
15 employee account and shall thereafter be credited with regular interest.
16 A police officer's voluntary contribution shall become a part of the
17 Police Officers Retirement System Fund and shall be held, administered,
18 invested, and distributed in the same manner as any other employee
19 contribution to the retirement system.
20 Sec. 2. Section 16-1027, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 16-1027 (1) At any time before the retirement date, the retiring
23 firefighter may elect to receive his or her pension benefit at retirement
24 either in the form of a straight life annuity or any optional form of
25 annuity benefit established by the retirement committee and provided
26 under a purchased annuity contract. Such optional annuity benefit shall
27 be specified in the funding medium for the retirement system and shall
28 include a straight life annuity with a guarantee of at least sixty
29 monthly payments or an annuity payable for the life of the retiring
30 firefighter and, after the death of the retiree, monthly payments, as
31 elected by the retiring firefighter, of one hundred percent, seventy-five

MJP - 03/10/2025 MJP - 03/10/2025
1 percent, or fifty percent of the amount of annuity payable to the
2 retiring firefighter during his or her life, to the beneficiary selected
3 by the retiring firefighter at the time of the original application for
4 an annuity. For any firefighter whose retirement date is on or after
5 January 1, 1997, the optional benefit forms for the retirement system
6 shall include permitting such firefighter, upon retirement, to receive a
7 payment of his or her retirement value in the form of a single lump-sum
8 payment or in the form of one or more partial payments of such retirement
9 value in an amount and frequency elected by the firefighter a single
10 lump-sum payment of the firefighter's retirement value. For firefighters
11 whose retirement date is prior to January 1, 1997, a single lump-sum
12 payment shall be available only if the city has adopted such distribution
13 option in the funding medium established for the retirement system. The
14 retiring firefighter may further elect to defer the date of the first
15 payment or lump-sum distribution to the first day of any specified month
16 prior to age seventy. In the event the retiring firefighter elects to
17 receive his or her pension benefit in the form of an annuity, the amount
18 of such annuity benefit shall be the amount provided by the annuity
19 contract purchased or otherwise provided by the firefighter's retirement
20 value as of the date of the first payment. Any such annuity contract
21 purchased by the retirement system may be distributed to the retiring
22 firefighter. Upon the payment of a lump sum or the distribution of a
23 paid-up annuity contract, all obligations of the retirement system to pay
24 retirement benefits to the firefighter and his or her beneficiaries shall
25 terminate, without exception.
26 (2) For all firefighters employed on January 1, 1984, the amount of
27 the pension benefit at the retirement date shall not be less than the
28 following amounts:
29 (a) If retirement from the city occurs following age fifty-five with
30 twenty-one years of service with the city, fifty percent of regular pay;
31 (b) If retirement from the city occurs following age fifty but

1 before age fifty-five with at least twenty-one years of service with the
2 city, such firefighter shall receive the actuarial equivalent of the
3 benefit which would otherwise be provided at age fifty-five;
4 (c) If retirement from the city occurs on or after age fifty-five
5 with less than twenty-one years of service with the city, such
6 firefighter shall receive a pension of at least fifty percent of the
7 salary he or she was receiving at the time of retirement multiplied by
8 the ratio of the years of service to twenty-one;
9 (d) For terminations of employment from the city on or after
10 September 9, 1993, if such termination of employment as a firefighter
11 occurs before age fifty-five but after completion of twenty-one years of
12 service with the city, such firefighter shall receive upon the attainment
13 of age fifty-five a pension benefit of fifty percent of regular pay;
14 (e) Unless an optional annuity benefit is selected by the retired
15 firefighter, at the death of any such retired firefighter the same rate
16 of pension as is provided for in this section shall be paid to the
17 surviving spouse of such deceased firefighter during such time as the
18 surviving spouse remains unmarried and, in case there is no surviving
19 spouse, then the minor children, if any, of such deceased firefighter
20 shall equally share such pension benefit during their minority, except
21 that as soon as a child of such deceased firefighter ceases to be a
22 minor, such pension as to such child shall cease; or
23 (f) In the event a retired firefighter or his or her surviving
24 beneficiaries die before the aggregate amount of pension payments
25 received by the firefighter and his or her survivor beneficiaries, if
26 any, equals the total amount in the firefighter's employee account, at
27 the time of the first benefit payment the difference between the total
28 amount in the employee's account and the aggregate amount of pension
29 payments received by the retired firefighter and his or her surviving
30 beneficiaries, if any, shall be paid in a single sum to the firefighter's
31 estate.

1 A firefighter entitled to a minimum pension benefit under this
2 subsection may elect to receive such pension benefit in any form
3 permitted by subsection (1) of this section, including a single lump-sum
4 payment, if the firefighter retires on or after January 1, 1997, or if
5 the city has adopted a lump-sum distribution option for firefighters
6 retiring before January 1, 1997, in the funding medium for the retirement
7 system. If the minimum pension benefit is paid in the form of an optional
8 annuity benefit or a single lump-sum payment, such benefit or payment
9 shall be the actuarial equivalent of the annuity that would otherwise be
10 paid to the firefighter pursuant to this subsection.
11 If the firefighter chooses the single lump-sum payment option, the
12 firefighter may request that the actuarial equivalent be equal to the
13 average of the cost of two annuity contracts based on products available
14 for purchase in Nebraska, if the difference between the cost of the two
15 annuity contracts does not exceed five percent. Of the two annuity
16 contracts used for comparison, one shall be chosen by the firefighter and
17 one shall be chosen by the city. If the difference between the two
18 annuity contracts exceeds five percent, the retirement committee shall
19 review the costs of the two annuity contracts and make a recommendation
20 to the city council as to the amount of the lump-sum payment to be made
21 to the firefighter. The city council shall, after a hearing, determine
22 the amount of the single lump-sum payment due the firefighter. The
23 annuity contracts used for comparison shall all use the same type of sex-
24 neutral basis benefit calculation.
25 (3) If the retirement value of a firefighter entitled to a minimum
26 pension benefit under subsection (2) of this section is not sufficient at
27 the time of the first payment to purchase or provide the required pension
28 benefit, the city shall utilize such funds as may be necessary from the
29 unallocated employer account of the retirement system to purchase or
30 provide for the required pension benefit.
31 (4) Any retiring firefighter whose pension benefit is less than

2 be paid a lump-sum settlement equal to the retirement value in lieu of
3 annuity and shall not be entitled to elect to receive annuity benefits.
4 Sec. 3. Sections 2 and 4 of this act become operative on October 1,
5 2025. The other sections of this act become operative on their effective
6 date.
7 Sec. 4. Original section 16-1027, Reissue Revised Statutes of
8 Nebraska, is repealed.
