AMENDMENTS TO LB89
Introduced by Riepe, 12.
1 1. Strike the original sections and insert the following new
2 sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 7 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Stand With Women Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
6 (1) Males and females possess unique and immutable differences that
7 manifest prior to birth and increase as they age and experience puberty;
8 (2) Differences between the sexes are enduring and may, in some
9 circumstances, warrant the creation of separate social, educational,
10 athletic, or other spaces in order to ensure safety and to allow members
11 of each sex to succeed and thrive;
12 (3) Physical differences between males and females have long made
13 separate and sex-specific sports teams important so that female athletes
14 can have equal opportunities to compete in sports while reducing the risk
15 of physical injury;
16 (4) Physical advantages for males relevant to sports include, on
17 average, a larger body size with more skeletal muscle mass, a lower
18 percentage of body fat, and a greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and
19 aerobic energy;
20 (5) Even at young ages, males typically score higher than females on
21 cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and
22 speed and agility. These differences become more pronounced during and
23 after puberty as males produce higher levels of testosterone. On average,
24 male athletes are bigger, faster, stronger, and more physically powerful
25 than their female counterparts. This results in a significant sports
26 performance gap between the sexes;

LB89 LB89
LPB - 04/22/2025 LPB - 04/22/2025
1 (6) Testosterone provides benefits in relation to athletic
2 performance;
3 (7) Studies have shown that the benefits that natural testosterone
4 provides to male athletes are not significantly diminished through the
5 use of testosterone suppression. Testosterone suppression in males does
6 not result in a level playing field between male and female athletes; and
7 (8) Because of the physical differences between males and females,
8 having separate athletic teams based on the sex of the athlete reduces
9 the chance of injury to female athletes, promotes equality between the
10 sexes, provides opportunities for female athletes to compete against
11 their female peers rather than against male athletes, and allows female
12 athletes to compete on a fair playing field for scholarships and other
13 athletic accomplishments.
14 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Stand With Women Act:
15 (1) Athletic association means a corporation, association, or
16 organization which has as one of its primary purposes the sponsoring or
17 administration of extracurricular interscholastic athletic contests or
18 competitions;
19 (2) Boy means an adolescent human male;
20 (3) Female means an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or
21 would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional
22 disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces,
23 transports, and utilizes eggs for fertilization. Female includes a woman
24 and a girl;
25 (4) Girl means an adolescent human female;
26 (5) Male means an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or
27 would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional
28 disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces,
29 transports, and utilizes sperm for fertilization. Male includes a man and
30 a boy;
31 (6) Man means an adult human male;

26 public school in an interscholastic sport, or a private school that is a
27 member of an athletic association, a team or sport designated for males,
