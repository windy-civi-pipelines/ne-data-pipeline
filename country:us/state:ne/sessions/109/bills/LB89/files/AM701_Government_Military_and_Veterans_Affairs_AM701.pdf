AMENDMENTS TO LB89
Introduced by Government, Military and Veterans Affairs.
1 1. Strike the original sections and insert the following new
2 sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 10 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Stand With Women Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
6 (1) Males and females possess unique and immutable differences that
7 manifest prior to birth and increase as they age and experience puberty;
8 (2) Differences between the sexes are enduring and may, in some
9 circumstances, warrant the creation of separate social, educational,
10 athletic, or other spaces in order to ensure safety and to allow members
11 of each sex to succeed and thrive;
12 (3) Physical differences between males and females have long made
13 separate and sex-specific sports teams important so that female athletes
14 can have equal opportunities to compete in sports while reducing the risk
15 of physical injury;
16 (4) Physical advantages for males relevant to sports include, on
17 average, a larger body size with more skeletal muscle mass, a lower
18 percentage of body fat, and a greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and
19 aerobic energy;
20 (5) Even at young ages, males typically score higher than females on
21 cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and
22 speed and agility. These differences become more pronounced during and
23 after puberty as males produce higher levels of testosterone. On average,
24 male athletes are bigger, faster, stronger, and more physically powerful
25 than their female counterparts. This results in a significant sports
26 performance gap between the sexes;
27 (6) Testosterone provides benefits in relation to athletic

1 performance;
2 (7) Studies have shown that the benefits that natural testosterone
3 provides to male athletes are not significantly diminished through the
4 use of testosterone suppression. Testosterone suppression in males does
5 not result in a level playing field between male and female athletes;
6 (8) Because of the physical differences between males and females,
7 having separate athletic teams based on the sex of the athlete reduces
8 the chance of injury to female athletes, promotes equality between the
9 sexes, provides opportunities for female athletes to compete against
10 their female peers rather than against male athletes, and allows female
11 athletes to compete on a fair playing field for scholarships and other
12 athletic accomplishments;
13 (9) Providing for separate restrooms and locker rooms for females
14 and males advances the important governmental objective of protecting the
15 privacy of individuals and shielding students' bodies from the opposite
16 sex; and
17 (10) Inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives with
18 respect to the definitions of sex, male, female, man, and woman have led
19 to endangerment of single-sex spaces and resources, necessitating
20 clarification of certain terms.
21 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Stand With Women Act:
22 (1) Athletic association means a corporation, association, or
23 organization which has as one of its primary purposes the sponsoring or
24 administration of extracurricular interscholastic athletic contests or
25 competitions;
26 (2) Boy means an adolescent human male;
27 (3) Designate means to post signage or otherwise provide indication
28 at or near the entrance to the restroom or locker room that is readily
29 visible and states that the restroom or locker room is designated as one
30 of the following: For use by females, for use by males, single occupancy,
31 or for use by families;
