1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 10 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Stand With Women Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (1) Males and females possess unique and immutable biological
5 differences that manifest prior to birth and increase as they age and
6 experience puberty;
7 (2) Biological differences between the sexes are enduring and may,
8 in some circumstances, warrant the creation of separate social,
9 educational, athletic, or other spaces in order to ensure safety and to
10 allow members of each sex to succeed and thrive;
11 (3) Physical differences between males and females have long made
12 separate and sex-specific sports teams important so that female athletes
13 can have equal opportunities to compete in sports while reducing the risk
14 of physical injury;
15 (4) Physical advantages for males relevant to sports include, on
16 average, a larger body size with more skeletal muscle mass, a lower
17 percentage of body fat, and a greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and
18 aerobic energy;
19 (5) Even at young ages, males typically score higher than females on
20 cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and
21 speed and agility. These differences become more pronounced during and
22 after puberty as males produce higher levels of testosterone. On average,
23 male athletes are bigger, faster, stronger, and more physically powerful
24 than their female counterparts. This results in a significant sports
25 performance gap between the sexes;
26 (6) Studies have shown that the benefits that natural testosterone
27 provides to male athletes are not significantly diminished through the
28 use of testosterone suppression. Testosterone suppression in males does
29 not result in a level playing field between male and female athletes;
30 (7) Because of the physical differences between males and females,
31 having separate athletic teams based on the biological sex of the athlete
-2-

1 reduces the chance of injury to female athletes, promotes equality
2 between the sexes, provides opportunities for female athletes to compete
3 against their female peers rather than against male athletes, and allows
4 female athletes to compete on a fair playing field for scholarships and
5 other athletic accomplishments;
6 (8) Providing for separate restrooms and locker rooms for females
7 and males advances the important governmental objective of protecting the
8 privacy of individuals and shielding students' bodies from the opposite
9 sex; and
10 (9) Inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives with
11 respect to the definitions of sex, male, female, man, and woman have led
12 to endangerment of single-sex spaces and resources, necessitating
13 clarification of certain terms.
14 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Stand With Women Act:
15 (1) Athletic association means a corporation, association, or
16 organization which has as one of its primary purposes the sponsoring or
17 administration of extracurricular interscholastic athletic contests or
18 competitions;
19 (2) Boy means an adolescent human male;
20 (3) Designate means to post signage at or near the entrance to the
21 restroom or locker room that is readily visible and states that the
22 restroom or locker room is either for use by females or for use by males;
23 (4) Female means a person whose biological reproductive system is
24 organized around the production of ova. Female includes a woman and a
25 girl;
26 (5) Girl means an adolescent human female;
27 (6) Male means a person whose biological reproductive system is
28 organized around the production of sperm. Male includes a man and a boy;
29 (7) Man means an adult human male;
30 (8) Postsecondary educational institution means a public or private
31 university, college, or community college located in Nebraska that is a
