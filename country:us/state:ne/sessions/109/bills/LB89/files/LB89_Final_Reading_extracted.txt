1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 7 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Stand With Women Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (1) Males and females possess unique and immutable differences that
5 manifest prior to birth and increase as they age and experience puberty;
6 (2) Differences between the sexes are enduring and may, in some
7 circumstances, warrant the creation of separate social, educational,
8 athletic, or other spaces in order to ensure safety and to allow members
9 of each sex to succeed and thrive;
10 (3) Physical differences between males and females have long made
11 separate and sex-specific sports teams important so that female athletes
12 can have equal opportunities to compete in sports while reducing the risk
13 of physical injury;
14 (4) Physical advantages for males relevant to sports include, on
15 average, a larger body size with more skeletal muscle mass, a lower
16 percentage of body fat, and a greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and
17 aerobic energy;
18 (5) Even at young ages, males typically score higher than females on
19 cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and
20 speed and agility. These differences become more pronounced during and
21 after puberty as males produce higher levels of testosterone. On average,
22 male athletes are bigger, faster, stronger, and more physically powerful
23 than their female counterparts. This results in a significant sports
24 performance gap between the sexes;
25 (6) Testosterone provides benefits in relation to athletic
26 performance;
27 (7) Studies have shown that the benefits that natural testosterone
28 provides to male athletes are not significantly diminished through the
29 use of testosterone suppression. Testosterone suppression in males does
30 not result in a level playing field between male and female athletes; and
31 (8) Because of the physical differences between males and females,
-2-
LB89 LB89
2025 2025
1 having separate athletic teams based on the sex of the athlete reduces
2 the chance of injury to female athletes, promotes equality between the
3 sexes, provides opportunities for female athletes to compete against
4 their female peers rather than against male athletes, and allows female
5 athletes to compete on a fair playing field for scholarships and other
6 athletic accomplishments.
7 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Stand With Women Act:
8 (1) Athletic association means a corporation, association, or
9 organization which has as one of its primary purposes the sponsoring or
10 administration of extracurricular interscholastic athletic contests or
11 competitions;
12 (2) Boy means an adolescent human male;
13 (3) Female means an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or
14 would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional
15 disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces,
16 transports, and utilizes eggs for fertilization. Female includes a woman
17 and a girl;
18 (4) Girl means an adolescent human female;
19 (5) Male means an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or
20 would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional
21 disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces,
22 transports, and utilizes sperm for fertilization. Male includes a man and
23 a boy;
24 (6) Man means an adult human male;
25 (7) Postsecondary educational institution means a university,
26 college, or community college located in Nebraska that is a member
27 institution of an accrediting body recognized by the United States
28 Department of Education;
