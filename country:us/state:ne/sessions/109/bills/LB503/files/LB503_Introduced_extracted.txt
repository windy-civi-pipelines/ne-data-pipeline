17 facility is taxed or in any year in which additional commissioned
18 nameplate capacity is added to a renewable energy generation facility,
19 the taxes on the initial or additional nameplate capacity shall be
20 prorated for the number of days remaining in the calendar year.
21 (iii) When a renewable energy generation facility is decommissioned
22 or made nonoperational by a change in law during a tax year, the taxes
23 shall be prorated for the number of days during which the renewable
24 energy generation facility was not decommissioned or was operational.
25 (iv) When the capacity of a renewable energy generation facility to
26 produce electricity is reduced but the renewable energy generation
27 facility is not decommissioned, the nameplate capacity of the renewable
28 energy generation facility is deemed to be unchanged.
29 (v) In the first year in which a county gains or loses its
30 designation as an American energy friendly county, the increased
31 nameplate capacity tax under subsection (8) of section 1 of this act on
-8-
LB503 LB503
2025 2025
1 owners of privately developed renewable energy generation facilities in
2 such county shall be prorated for the number of days the department
3 designated the county an American energy friendly county during such
4 year.
5 (6)(a) On March 1 of each year, the owner of a renewable energy
6 generation facility shall file with the Department of Revenue a report on
7 the nameplate capacity of the facility for the previous year from January
8 1 through December 31. All taxes shall be due on April 1 and shall be
9 delinquent if not paid on a quarterly basis on April 1 and each quarter
10 thereafter. Delinquent quarterly payments shall draw interest at the rate
11 provided for in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be
12 adjusted.
13 (b) The owner of a renewable energy generation facility is liable
14 for the taxes under this section with respect to the facility, whether or
15 not the owner of the facility is the owner of the land on which the
16 facility is situated.
17 (7) Failure to file a report required by subsection (6) of this
18 section, filing such report late, failure to pay taxes due, or
19 underpayment of such taxes shall result in a penalty of five percent of
20 the amount due being imposed for each quarter the report is overdue or
21 the payment is delinquent, except that the penalty shall not exceed ten
22 thousand dollars.
23 (8) The Department of Revenue shall enforce the provisions of this
24 section. The department may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
25 necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this section.
26 (9) The Department of Revenue shall separately identify the proceeds
27 from the tax imposed by this section and shall pay all such proceeds over
28 to the county treasurer of the county where the renewable energy
29 generation facility is located within thirty days after receipt of such
30 proceeds.

11 facility that commences commercial operation in an American energy
12 friendly county shall, so long as such facility continues commercial
13 operation in an American energy friendly county, pay a nameplate capacity
14 tax at one and one-half times the rate set for other privately developed
15 renewable energy generation facilities in subdivision (1)(a) of section
16 77-6203.
17 (9) The American Energy Friendly Counties Fund is created. The fund
18 shall be administered by the department and shall be used to award grants
19 pursuant to subsection (10) of this section to help qualifying counties
20 become American energy friendly counties. The fund shall consist of money
21 transferred by the Legislature and gifts, grants, or bequests from any
22 source, including money remitted to the fund from any other federal,
23 state, public, and private sources. Any money in the fund available for
24 investment shall be invested by the state investment officer pursuant to
25 the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds
26 Investment Act.
27 (10) The department shall create and administer a grant program to

7 77-6203 (1) The owner of a renewable energy generation facility
8 annually shall pay (a) a nameplate capacity tax equal to the total
9 nameplate capacity of the commissioned renewable energy generation
10 facility multiplied by a tax rate of three thousand five hundred eighteen
11 dollars per megawatt or (b) the nameplate capacity tax described in
12 subsection (8) of section 1 of this act, whichever is applicable.
13 (2) No tax shall be imposed on a renewable energy generation
14 facility:
15 (a) Owned or operated by the federal government, the State of
16 Nebraska, a public power district, a public power and irrigation
17 district, an individual municipality, a registered group of
18 municipalities, an electric membership association, or a cooperative; or
19 (b) That is a customer-generator as defined in section 70-2002.
20 (3) No tax levied pursuant to this section shall be construed to
21 constitute restricted funds as defined in section 13-518 for the first
22 five years after the renewable energy generation facility is
23 commissioned.
24 (4) The presence of one or more renewable energy generation
25 facilities or supporting infrastructure shall not be a factor in the
26 assessment, determination of actual value, or classification under
27 section 77-201 of the real property underlying or adjacent to such
28 facilities or infrastructure.
29 (5)(a) The Department of Revenue shall collect the tax due under
30 this section.

1 renewable energy generation facility is commissioned. A renewable energy
2 generation facility that uses wind as the fuel source which was
3 commissioned prior to July 15, 2010, shall be subject to the tax levied
4 pursuant to sections 77-6201 to 77-6204 on and after January 1, 2010. The
5 amount of property tax on depreciable tangible personal property
6 previously paid on a renewable energy generation facility that uses wind
7 as the fuel source which was commissioned prior to July 15, 2010, which
8 is greater than the amount that would have been paid pursuant to sections
9 77-6201 to 77-6204 from the date of commissioning until January 1, 2010,
10 shall be credited against any tax due under Chapter 77, and any amount so
11 credited that is unused in any tax year shall be carried over to
12 subsequent tax years until fully utilized.
13 (c)(i) The tax for the first calendar year shall be prorated based
14 upon the number of days remaining in the calendar year after the
15 renewable energy generation facility is commissioned.
16 (ii) In the first year in which a renewable energy generation
17 facility is taxed or in any year in which additional commissioned
18 nameplate capacity is added to a renewable energy generation facility,
19 the taxes on the initial or additional nameplate capacity shall be
20 prorated for the number of days remaining in the calendar year.
21 (iii) When a renewable energy generation facility is decommissioned
22 or made nonoperational by a change in law during a tax year, the taxes
23 shall be prorated for the number of days during which the renewable
24 energy generation facility was not decommissioned or was operational.
25 (iv) When the capacity of a renewable energy generation facility to
26 produce electricity is reduced but the renewable energy generation
27 facility is not decommissioned, the nameplate capacity of the renewable
28 energy generation facility is deemed to be unchanged.
29 (v) In the first year in which a county gains or loses its
30 designation as an American energy friendly county, the increased
31 nameplate capacity tax under subsection (8) of section 1 of this act on
-8-

LB503 LB503

1 owners of privately developed renewable energy generation facilities in
2 such county shall be prorated for the number of days the department
3 designated the county an American energy friendly county during such
4 year.
5 (6)(a) On March 1 of each year, the owner of a renewable energy
6 generation facility shall file with the Department of Revenue a report on
7 the nameplate capacity of the facility for the previous year from January
8 1 through December 31. All taxes shall be due on April 1 and shall be
9 delinquent if not paid on a quarterly basis on April 1 and each quarter
10 thereafter. Delinquent quarterly payments shall draw interest at the rate
11 provided for in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be
12 adjusted.
13 (b) The owner of a renewable energy generation facility is liable
14 for the taxes under this section with respect to the facility, whether or
15 not the owner of the facility is the owner of the land on which the
16 facility is situated.
17 (7) Failure to file a report required by subsection (6) of this
18 section, filing such report late, failure to pay taxes due, or
19 underpayment of such taxes shall result in a penalty of five percent of
20 the amount due being imposed for each quarter the report is overdue or
21 the payment is delinquent, except that the penalty shall not exceed ten
22 thousand dollars.
23 (8) The Department of Revenue shall enforce the provisions of this
24 section. The department may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
25 necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this section.
26 (9) The Department of Revenue shall separately identify the proceeds
27 from the tax imposed by this section and shall pay all such proceeds over
28 to the county treasurer of the county where the renewable energy
29 generation facility is located within thirty days after receipt of such
30 proceeds.
