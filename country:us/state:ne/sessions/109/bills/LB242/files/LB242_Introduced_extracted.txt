4 2024, is amended to read:
5 77-1701 (1) The county treasurer shall be ex officio county
6 collector of all taxes levied within the county. The county board shall
7 designate a county official to mail or otherwise deliver a statement of
8 the amount of taxes due and a notice that special assessments are due, to
9 the last-known address of the person, firm, association, or corporation
10 against whom such taxes or special assessments are assessed or to the
11 lending institution or other party responsible for paying such taxes or
12 special assessments. Such statement shall clearly indicate, for each
13 political subdivision, the levy rate and the amount of property taxes due
14 to fund any and all public safety services, regardless of whether such
15 amount is taken as an exception to the political subdivision's property
16 tax request authority under section 13-3404 as defined in section 13-320,
17 county attorneys, and public defenders. Such statement shall also clearly
18 indicate, for each political subdivision, the levy rate and the amount of
19 taxes due as the result of principal or interest payments on bonds issued
20 by the political subdivision and shall show such rate and amount separate
21 from any other levy. When taxes on real property are delinquent for a
22 prior year, the county treasurer shall indicate this information on the
23 current year tax statement in bold letters. The information provided
24 shall inform the taxpayer that delinquent taxes and interest are due for
25 the prior year or years and shall indicate the specific year or years for
26 which such taxes and interest remain unpaid. The language shall read
27 "Back Taxes and Interest Due For", followed by numbers to indicate each
28 year for which back taxes and interest are due and a statement indicating
29 that failure to pay the back taxes and interest may result in the loss of
30 the real property. Failure to receive such statement or notice shall not
31 relieve the taxpayer from any liability to pay such taxes or special
-14-

2025 2025
1 assessments and any interest or penalties accrued thereon. In any county
2 in which a city of the metropolitan class is located, all statements of
3 taxes shall also include notice that special assessments for cutting
4 weeds, removing litter, and demolishing buildings are due.
5 (2) Notice that special assessments are due shall not be required
6 for special assessments levied by sanitary and improvement districts
7 organized under Chapter 31, article 7, except that such notice may be
8 provided by the county at the discretion of the county board or by the
9 sanitary and improvement district with the approval of the county board.
10 (3) A statement of the amount of taxes due and a notice that special
11 assessments are due shall not be required to be mailed or otherwise
12 delivered pursuant to subsection (1) of this section if the total amount
13 of the taxes and special assessments due is less than two dollars.
14 Failure to receive the statement or notice shall not relieve the taxpayer
15 from any liability to pay the taxes or special assessments but shall
16 relieve the taxpayer from any liability for interest or penalties. Taxes
17 and special assessments of less than two dollars shall be added to the
18 amount of taxes and special assessments due in subsequent years and shall
19 not be considered delinquent until the total amount is two dollars or
20 more.
21 Sec. 13. Section 77-7305, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
22 2024, is amended to read:

29 hundred eight million dollars. For tax year 2027, the total amount of
30 relief granted under the act shall be eight hundred thirty-eight million
31 dollars. For tax year 2028, the total amount of relief granted under the

LB242 LB242
2025 2025
1 act shall be eight hundred seventy million dollars. For tax year 2029,
2 the total amount of relief granted under the act shall be nine hundred
3 two million dollars. For tax year 2030 and each tax year thereafter, the
4 total amount of relief granted under the act shall be the total amount of
5 relief from the prior year increased by three percent. The relief shall
6 be in the form of property tax credits which appear on property tax
7 statements. Property tax credits granted under the act shall be credited
8 against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts.
9 (2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each
10 parcel, the county treasurer shall multiply the amount disbursed to the
11 county under subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school
12 district taxes levied in the current prior year on the parcel to the
13 school district taxes levied in the current prior year on all real
14 property in the county. The amount so determined shall be the property
15 tax credit for that parcel.
16 (3) If the real property owner qualifies for a homestead exemption
17 under sections 77-3501 to 77-3529, the owner shall also be qualified for
18 the property tax credit provided in this section to the extent of any
19 remaining liability after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the
20 property tax credit provided in this section results in a property tax
21 liability on the homestead that is less than zero, the amount of the
22 credit which cannot be used by the taxpayer shall be returned to the
23 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
24 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall
25 immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection to the School
26 District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund. Upon the return of any funds
27 under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a
28 report with the Property Tax Administrator, on a form prescribed by the
29 Tax Commissioner, indicating the amount of funds distributed to each
30 school district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the
31 amount of unused credits returned.
-16-
LB242 LB242
2025 2025
1 (4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be
2 equal to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of
3 this section multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
4 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
5 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
6 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year
7 thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall determine the amount to
8 be disbursed under this subsection to each county and shall certify such
9 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
10 the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on or before
11 January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
12 (5) After retaining one percent of the amount The county treasurer
13 shall disburse amounts received under subsection (4) of this section for
14 costs, the county treasurer shall disburse the remaining funds, which are
15 credited against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts,
16 in the same manner as if such funds had been received in the form of
17 property tax payments for property taxes owed to school districts,
18 meaning any amounts attributable to divided taxes pursuant to section
19 18-2147 of the Community Development Law shall be remitted to the
20 applicable authority for which such taxes were divided.
21 (6) The School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund shall be
22 used for purposes of making the disbursements to counties required under
23 subsection (4) of this section.
24 Sec. 14. Original sections 14-109, 15-202, 15-203, 16-205, and
25 17-525, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and sections 13-518,
26 13-3403, 13-3404, 13-3405, 13-3406, 18-1208, 77-1701, and 77-7305,
27 Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
28 Sec. 15. Since an emergency exists, this act takes effect when
29 passed and approved according to law.

2 the total amount of relief granted under the act shall be nine hundred
3 two million dollars. For tax year 2030 and each tax year thereafter, the
4 total amount of relief granted under the act shall be the total amount of
5 relief from the prior year increased by three percent. The relief shall
6 be in the form of property tax credits which appear on property tax
7 statements. Property tax credits granted under the act shall be credited
8 against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts.
9 (2) To determine the amount of the property tax credit for each
10 parcel, the county treasurer shall multiply the amount disbursed to the
11 county under subsection (4) of this section by the ratio of the school
12 district taxes levied in the current prior year on the parcel to the
13 school district taxes levied in the current prior year on all real
14 property in the county. The amount so determined shall be the property
15 tax credit for that parcel.
16 (3) If the real property owner qualifies for a homestead exemption
17 under sections 77-3501 to 77-3529, the owner shall also be qualified for
18 the property tax credit provided in this section to the extent of any
19 remaining liability after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the
20 property tax credit provided in this section results in a property tax
21 liability on the homestead that is less than zero, the amount of the
22 credit which cannot be used by the taxpayer shall be returned to the
23 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
24 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall
25 immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection to the School
26 District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund. Upon the return of any funds
27 under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a
28 report with the Property Tax Administrator, on a form prescribed by the

30 school district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the
31 amount of unused credits returned.
-16-

LB242 LB242
2025 2025
1 (4) The amount disbursed to each county under this section shall be
2 equal to the amount available for disbursement under subsection (1) of
3 this section multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
4 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
5 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
6 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year
7 thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall determine the amount to
8 be disbursed under this subsection to each county and shall certify such
9 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
10 the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on or before
11 January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
12 (5) After retaining one percent of the amount The county treasurer
13 shall disburse amounts received under subsection (4) of this section for
14 costs, the county treasurer shall disburse the remaining funds, which are
15 credited against the amount of property taxes owed to school districts,
16 in the same manner as if such funds had been received in the form of
17 property tax payments for property taxes owed to school districts,
18 meaning any amounts attributable to divided taxes pursuant to section
19 18-2147 of the Community Development Law shall be remitted to the
20 applicable authority for which such taxes were divided.
21 (6) The School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund shall be
22 used for purposes of making the disbursements to counties required under
23 subsection (4) of this section.
