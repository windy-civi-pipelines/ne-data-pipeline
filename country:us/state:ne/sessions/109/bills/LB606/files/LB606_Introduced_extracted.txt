1 purposes of this subsection, release or reentry plan means a

23 component to track the effectiveness of interventions.
24 (c) Any committed offender with a mental illness shall be evaluated
25 before release to ensure that adequate monitoring and treatment of the

27 proceeding under the Nebraska Mental Health Commitment Act or the Sex
28 Offender Commitment Act will take place.
29 (6)(a) Within thirty days after any committed offender has been
30 paroled, all available information regarding such parolee shall be

22 notice is given to the parolee. Intentional failure to comply with the

22 parole.
23 (3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming

15 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
16 refusal to obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's
17 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
18 payment, the board may allow the parolee additional time for payment,
19 reduce the amount of each installment, or revoke the fees or the unpaid
20 portion in whole or in part.
21 (7) No parolee shall be required to pay more than one monthly parole
22 programming fee per month.

16 the committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
17 (b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
18 correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in

1 individual the opportunity to submit written materials to the department

3 (2) If the department division determines, after reviewing the
4 individual's conduct while under supervision and any other relevant
5 facts, that one or more of the conditions of community supervision
6 imposed upon the individual is no longer necessary to reduce the risk of
7 the individual reoffending or is no longer the least restrictive
8 condition compatible with public safety, the department division shall
9 revise the conditions of community supervision so that the individual's

17 the county where the individual resides. The individual shall be informed
18 of his or her right to request counsel, and if counsel is requested the

23 conditions of community supervision, the burden of proof shall be on the
24 individual subject to community supervision to show by clear and
25 convincing evidence (a) that the conditions in question will not reduce
26 the risk of the individual reoffending or otherwise protect the public or
27 (b) that the condition is overly restrictive of the individual's freedom
28 and a less restrictive condition is available which is equally or more
29 effective in reducing the risk of the individual reoffending.

2025 2025
1 the committed offender or the availability of any program. Any
2 modification shall be made only after notice is given to the committed

21 availability of any program. Any modification shall be made only after
22 notice is given to the parolee. Intentional failure to comply with the
23 approved case plan by any parolee as scheduled for any year, or pro rata
24 part thereof, shall cause disciplinary action to be taken by the
25 department division resulting in the forfeiture of up to a maximum of
26 three months' good time for the scheduled year.
27 (7) While the offender is in the custody of the board, reductions of
28 terms granted pursuant to subdivision (2)(a) of this section may be

21 second month of parole supervision and continuing for the duration of the
22 parole.
23 (3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming
24 fee in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that
25 such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the parolee due to
26 limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental

28 that the parolee is unable to pay his or her monthly parole programming
29 fee.

15 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
16 refusal to obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's
17 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
18 payment, the board may allow the parolee additional time for payment,
19 reduce the amount of each installment, or revoke the fees or the unpaid
20 portion in whole or in part.
21 (7) No parolee shall be required to pay more than one monthly parole
22 programming fee per month.

20 (3) The board may parole an offender who is eligible for release to
21 a warrant or detainer. If an offender is paroled to such a warrant or
22 detainer, the board may provide, as a condition of release, that if the
23 charge or charges on which the warrant or detainer is based are
24 dismissed, or are satisfied after conviction and sentence, prior to the
25 expiration of the offender's parole term, the authority to whose warrant
26 or detainer the offender is released shall return the offender to serve
27 the remainder of the parole term or such part as the board may determine.
28 (4) If a person paroled to a warrant or detainer is thereafter
29 sentenced and placed on probation, or released on parole in another

2025 2025
1 imposition of sanctions shall be made only after the individual file has
2 been reviewed. The contents of the individual file shall be confidential
3 unless disclosed in connection with a public hearing and shall not be
4 subject to public inspection except by court order for good cause shown.
5 The contents of the file shall not be accessible to any person under the
6 jurisdiction of the Board of Parole. A person under the jurisdiction of
7 the board may obtain access to his or her medical records by request to
8 the provider pursuant to sections 71-8401 to 71-8407 notwithstanding the
9 fact that such medical records may be a part of his or her parole file.
10 The board and the department Division of Parole Supervision have the
11 authority to withhold decision guideline scores, risk and needs
12 assessment scores, and mental health and psychological records of a
13 person under the jurisdiction of the board when appropriate.
14 (3) Nothing in this section limits in any manner the authority of
15 the Public Counsel to inspect and examine the records and documents of
16 the board and the department Division of Parole Supervision pursuant to
17 sections 81-8,240 to 81-8,254, except that the Public Counsel's access to
18 the medical or mental health records of a person under the jurisdiction
19 of the board shall be subject to his or her consent. The office of Public
20 Counsel shall not disclose the medical or mental health records of a
21 person under the jurisdiction of the board to anyone else, including any
22 other person under the jurisdiction of the board, except as authorized by
23 law.
24 (4) For any person under the jurisdiction of the Board of Parole,
25 the board shall provide such person's (a) name, (b) parole officer, and
26 (c) conditions of parole to the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement
27 and Criminal Justice which shall provide access to such information to
28 law enforcement agencies through the state's criminal justice information
29 system.
30 Sec. 59. Section 83-962, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
31 amended to read:
-71-

LB606 LB606
2025 2025
1 83-962 (1) A correctional system overcrowding emergency shall exist
2 whenever the director certifies that the department's inmate population
3 is over one hundred forty percent of operational design capacity. The
4 director shall so certify within thirty days after the date on which the
5 population first exceeds one hundred forty percent of operational design
6 capacity.
7 (2) During a correctional system overcrowding emergency, the board
8 shall immediately consider or reconsider committed offenders eligible for
9 parole who have not been released on parole.
10 (3) Upon such consideration or reconsideration, and for all other
11 consideration of committed offenders eligible for parole while the
12 correctional system overcrowding emergency is in effect, the board shall
13 order the release of each committed offender unless it is of the opinion
14 that such release should be deferred because:
15 (a) The board has determined that it is more likely than not that
16 the committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
17 (b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
18 correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in
19 the facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a
20 law-abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed
21 offender would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on
22 institutional discipline; or
23 (c) The board has determined that there is a very substantial risk
24 that the committed offender will commit a violent act against a person.
25 (4) In making the determination regarding the risk that a committed
26 offender will not conform to the conditions of parole, the board shall
27 take into account the factors set forth in subsection (2) of section
28 83-1,114 and shall comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of
29 section 83-1,114 and section 83-196.01.
30 (5) The board shall continue granting parole to offenders under this
31 section until the director certifies that the population is at
-72-

1 operational capacity. The director shall so certify within thirty days
2 after the date on which the population first reaches operational
