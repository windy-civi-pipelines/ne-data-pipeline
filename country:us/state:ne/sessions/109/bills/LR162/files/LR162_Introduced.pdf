FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 162
Introduced by McKinney, 11.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine necessary reforms to Nebraska's criminal and prison systems in light of
the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision in State ex rel. Hilgers v. Evnen, 318
Neb. 803 (2025), which upheld the constitutionality of accelerated and
geriatric parole eligibility provisions enacted by Laws 2023, LB50. The study
will focus on the implications of this ruling for parole eligibility,
sentencing structure, overcrowding in correctional facilities, reentry
planning, and equitable application of parole policies for all incarcerated
individuals. The study shall include, but is not limited to, an examination of
the following:
(1) The projected impact of the accelerated and geriatric parole
eligibility provisions upheld by the Nebraska Supreme Court on the state's
prison population, parole board capacity, and reentry services;
(2) The implementation status and timeline for applying the provisions of
Laws 2023, LB50, to eligible incarcerated individuals and ensuring timely
parole hearings;
(3) The existing barriers to parole for individuals serving long-term
consecutive or mandatory sentences and recommendations to enhance fairness and
transparency in eligibility determinations;
(4) The development of a uniform, service-based needs assessment process
for individuals eligible for parole that includes, but is not limited to,
mental health, educational, vocational, and trauma-informed evaluations;
(5) The coordination between the Department of Correctional Services, the
Board of Parole, and reentry organizations to ensure a smooth transition for
individuals released under the new eligibility framework; and
