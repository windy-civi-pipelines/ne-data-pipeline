3 operated by a service provider which is certified or licensed by the

5 assistance program established pursuant to the Medical Assistance Act and
6 Title XIX or XXI of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, the
7 student shall remain a resident of the district in which he or she

29 student, approved special education rates, the department's general
30 experience with special education budgets, and the cost per student in

14 services may be provided through (i) such interim-program school or
15 approved or accredited school, (ii) a contract between the residential
16 setting and the school district in which such residential setting is
17 located, (iii) a contract between the residential setting and another
18 service agency as defined in section 79-1124, or (iv) a combination of
19 such educational service providers.
20 (d) If a school district pays a school district in which a
21 residential setting is located for educational services provided pursuant
22 to subdivision (10)(b) of this section and it is later determined that a
23 different school district was the resident school district for such
24 student at the time such educational services were provided, the school
25 district that was later determined to be the resident school district
26 shall reimburse the school district that initially paid for the
27 educational services one hundred ten percent of the amount paid.
28 (e) A student residing in a residential setting described in this
29 subsection shall be defined as a student with a handicap pursuant to
30 Article VII, section 11, of the Constitution of Nebraska, and as such the

6 enrolling in such school also apply to a student enrolling in such school
7 that has an individualized family service plan, has an individualized
8 education program under the federal Individuals with Disabilities
