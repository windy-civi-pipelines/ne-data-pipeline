2 amended to read:
3 76-1446 (1) Trial of the action for possession shall be held not
4 less than ten nor more than fourteen days after the issuance of the
5 summons, unless additional time is granted pursuant to court order. The
6 action shall be tried by the court without a jury. If the plaintiff
7 serves the summons in the manner provided in section 76-1442.01, the
8 action shall proceed as other actions for possession except that a money

11 restitution of the premises, the court shall declare the forfeiture of
12 the rental agreement, and shall, at the request of the plaintiff or his
13 or her attorney, issue a writ of restitution, directing the constable or
14 sheriff to restore possession of the premises to the plaintiff on a
15 specified date not less more than ten days after issuance of the writ of
16 restitution. The court may order the writ of restitution to be executed
17 on a date less than ten days after its issuance only upon:

19 the safety of other tenants, the landlord, or the landlord's employees or
20 agents; or
21 (b) The informed and express agreement of the parties.
22 (3) The plaintiff shall comply with the Disposition of Personal
