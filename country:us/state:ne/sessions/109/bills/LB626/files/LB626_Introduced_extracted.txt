20 Sec. 2. Section 18-2102, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 18-2102 It is hereby found and declared that there exist in cities
23 of all classes and villages of this state areas which have deteriorated
24 and become substandard and blighted because of the unsafe, insanitary,
25 inadequate, or overcrowded condition of the dwellings therein, or because
26 of inadequate planning of the area, or excessive land coverage by the
27 buildings thereon, or the lack of proper light and air and open space, or
28 because of the defective design and arrangement of the buildings thereon,
29 or faulty street or lot layout, or congested traffic conditions, or
30 economically or socially undesirable land uses, or the lack of affordable
31 housing in the area. Such conditions or a combination of some or all of
-3-
LB626 LB626
2025 2025
1 them have resulted and will continue to result in making such areas
2 economic or social liabilities harmful to the social and economic well-
3 being of the entire communities in which they exist, needlessly
4 increasing public expenditures, imposing onerous municipal burdens,
5 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, substantially impairing or
6 arresting the sound growth of municipalities, aggravating traffic
7 problems, substantially impairing or arresting the elimination of traffic
8 hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities, and depreciating
9 general community-wide values. The existence of such areas contributes
10 substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime,
11 necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
12 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
13 prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment and the treatment of
14 juvenile delinquency, and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire,
15 and accident protection and other public services and facilities. These
16 conditions are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory process in
17 the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by
18 the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids herein
19 provided. The elimination of such conditions and the acquisition and
20 preparation of land in or necessary to the renewal of substandard and
21 blighted areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in
22 accordance with general plans and redevelopment plans of communities and
23 any assistance which may be given by any state public body in connection
24 therewith are public uses and purposes for which public money may be
25 expended and private property acquired. The necessity in the public
26 interest for the provisions of the Community Development Law is hereby
27 declared to be a matter of legislative determination.
28 It is further found and declared that the prevention and elimination
29 of blight is a matter of state policy, public interest, and statewide
30 concern and within the powers and authority inhering in and reserved to
31 the state, in order that the state and its municipalities shall not
-4-
LB626 LB626
2025 2025
1 continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease,
2 promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of
3 their revenue.
4 It is further found and declared that certain substandard and
5 blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance,
6 and disposition, subject to use restrictions, as provided in the
7 Community Development Law, since the prevailing conditions of decay may
8 make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or
9 rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the
10 means provided in the Community Development Law, be susceptible of
11 conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and
12 evils, hereinbefore enumerated, may be eliminated, remedied, or
13 prevented; and that salvageable substandard and blighted areas can be
14 conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action and the
15 cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in
16 such areas.
17 Sec. 3. Section 18-2103, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
18 2024, is amended to read:
19 18-2103 For purposes of the Community Development Law, unless the
20 context otherwise requires:
21 (1) Affordable housing means (a) workforce housing, (b) housing
22 targeted for households earning less than sixty percent of the median

1 (4) (3) Blighted area means an area (a) which, by reason of the
2 presence of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating
3 structures, existence of defective or inadequate street layout, faulty
4 lot layout in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility, or usefulness,

6 improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special assessment
7 delinquency exceeding the fair value of the land, defective or unusual
8 conditions of title, improper subdivision, or obsolete or no platting, or
9 the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by fire and
10 other causes, or any combination of such factors, substantially impairs
11 or arrests the sound growth of the community, retards the provision of
12 housing accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability

27 percent of the city as blighted, a city of the second class shall not
28 designate an area larger than fifty percent of the city as blighted, and

20 Sec. 2. Section 18-2102, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 18-2102 It is hereby found and declared that there exist in cities
23 of all classes and villages of this state areas which have deteriorated
24 and become substandard and blighted because of the unsafe, insanitary,
25 inadequate, or overcrowded condition of the dwellings therein, or because
26 of inadequate planning of the area, or excessive land coverage by the
27 buildings thereon, or the lack of proper light and air and open space, or
28 because of the defective design and arrangement of the buildings thereon,
29 or faulty street or lot layout, or congested traffic conditions, or
30 economically or socially undesirable land uses, or the lack of affordable
31 housing in the area. Such conditions or a combination of some or all of
-3-

LB626 LB626
2025 2025
1 them have resulted and will continue to result in making such areas
2 economic or social liabilities harmful to the social and economic well-
3 being of the entire communities in which they exist, needlessly
4 increasing public expenditures, imposing onerous municipal burdens,
5 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, substantially impairing or
6 arresting the sound growth of municipalities, aggravating traffic
7 problems, substantially impairing or arresting the elimination of traffic
8 hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities, and depreciating
9 general community-wide values. The existence of such areas contributes
10 substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime,
11 necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
12 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
13 prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment and the treatment of
14 juvenile delinquency, and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire,
15 and accident protection and other public services and facilities. These
16 conditions are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory process in
17 the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by
18 the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids herein
19 provided. The elimination of such conditions and the acquisition and
20 preparation of land in or necessary to the renewal of substandard and
21 blighted areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in
22 accordance with general plans and redevelopment plans of communities and
23 any assistance which may be given by any state public body in connection
24 therewith are public uses and purposes for which public money may be
25 expended and private property acquired. The necessity in the public
26 interest for the provisions of the Community Development Law is hereby
27 declared to be a matter of legislative determination.
28 It is further found and declared that the prevention and elimination
29 of blight is a matter of state policy, public interest, and statewide
30 concern and within the powers and authority inhering in and reserved to
31 the state, in order that the state and its municipalities shall not
-4-

LB626 LB626
2025 2025
1 continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease,
2 promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of
3 their revenue.
4 It is further found and declared that certain substandard and
5 blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance,
6 and disposition, subject to use restrictions, as provided in the
7 Community Development Law, since the prevailing conditions of decay may
8 make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or
9 rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the
10 means provided in the Community Development Law, be susceptible of
11 conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and
12 evils, hereinbefore enumerated, may be eliminated, remedied, or
13 prevented; and that salvageable substandard and blighted areas can be
14 conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action and the
15 cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in
16 such areas.
17 Sec. 3. Section 18-2103, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
18 2024, is amended to read:
19 18-2103 For purposes of the Community Development Law, unless the
20 context otherwise requires:
21 (1) Affordable housing means (a) workforce housing, (b) housing
22 targeted for households earning less than sixty percent of the median

25 (2) (1) Area of operation means and includes the area within the

2 presence of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating
3 structures, existence of defective or inadequate street layout, faulty
4 lot layout in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility, or usefulness,

6 improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special assessment
7 delinquency exceeding the fair value of the land, defective or unusual
8 conditions of title, improper subdivision, or obsolete or no platting, or
9 the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by fire and
10 other causes, or any combination of such factors, substantially impairs
11 or arrests the sound growth of the community, retards the provision of
12 housing accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability

28 designate an area larger than fifty percent of the city as blighted, and
