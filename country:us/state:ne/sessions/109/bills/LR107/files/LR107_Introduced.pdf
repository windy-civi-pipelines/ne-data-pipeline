Introduced by Hansen, 16.
WHEREAS, Michael Nissen of Oakland, Nebraska, is recognized for his
dedication to tree planting and conservation and is the recipient of the

WHEREAS, Nissen, his wife, Jessica, and their children, Caleb and Ella,
have demonstrated a strong commitment to the planting and care of trees,
ensuring both immediate benefits and long-term sustainability for their family
farm; and
WHEREAS, Nissen began working with the Lower Elkhorn Natural Resources
District (LENRD) three years ago to develop a strategic tree planting plan that
will enhance their land for generations to come; and
WHEREAS, through his foresight and planning, Nissen has inspired his
family to actively participate in tree conservation efforts, instilling in his
children a lifelong appreciation for natural resource stewardship; and
WHEREAS, despite the challenges of full-time jobs, young children, and
ongoing drought conditions, the Nissen family has planted and cared for

dedication to conservation; and
WHEREAS, Nissen's proactive approach to tree planting ensures that as
their children grow and family activities increase, the trees will be well-
established and the farmstead will provide lasting benefits; and
