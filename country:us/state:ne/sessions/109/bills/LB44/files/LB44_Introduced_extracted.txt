2 2024, is amended to read:
3 29-3001 (1) A prisoner in custody under sentence and claiming a
4 right to be released on the ground that there was such a denial or
5 infringement of the rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment void
6 or voidable under the Constitution of this state or the Constitution of
7 the United States, may file a verified motion, in the court which imposed
8 such sentence, stating the grounds relied upon and asking the court to
9 vacate or set aside the sentence.
10 (2) Unless the motion and the files and records of the case show to
11 the satisfaction of the court that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,
12 the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the county attorney,
13 grant a prompt hearing thereon, and determine the issues and make
14 findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. If the
15 court finds that there was such a denial or infringement of the rights of
16 the prisoner as to render the judgment void or voidable under the
17 Constitution of this state or the Constitution of the United States, the
18 court shall vacate and set aside the judgment and shall discharge the
19 prisoner or resentence the prisoner or grant a new trial as may appear
20 appropriate. Proceedings under the provisions of sections 29-3001 to
21 29-3004 shall be civil in nature. Costs shall be taxed as in habeas

27 motions for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.
28 (4) A one-year period of limitation shall apply to the filing of a
29 verified motion for postconviction relief. The one-year limitation period
30 shall run from the later of:

8 Nebraska or any law of this state, is removed, if the prisoner was
9 prevented from filing a verified motion by such state action;

16 Supreme Court. This subdivision only applies if, within thirty days after
