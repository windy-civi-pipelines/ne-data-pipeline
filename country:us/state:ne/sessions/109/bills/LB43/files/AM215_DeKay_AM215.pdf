2 electric supplier's cost.
3 (3) Within ten days after receipt of a written notice complying with
4 subsection (2) of this section, the executive director of the board shall
5 issue a written acknowledgment that the privately developed renewable

18 the power of eminent domain to a private electric supplier or limit the
19 rights of any entity to acquire any public, municipal, or utility right-
20 of-way across property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
21 developed renewable energy generation facility as long as the right-of-
22 way does not prevent the operation of or access to the privately
23 developed renewable energy generation facility.
24 (6) Only a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the State
25 of Nebraska may exercise eminent domain authority to acquire the land
26 rights necessary for the construction of transmission lines and related
27 facilities. There is a rebuttable presumption that the exercise of
28 eminent domain to provide needed transmission lines and related
29 facilities for a privately developed renewable energy generation facility
30 is a public use.
31 (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
-11-

4 authority of or require a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in
5 the State of Nebraska to enter into a joint agreement with a private
6 electric supplier to develop, construct, and jointly own a privately
7 developed renewable energy generation facility.
8 Sec. 4. Section 70-1015, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,

14 obtaining board approval, whichever is required, or (b) serving or
15 attempting to serve at retail any customers located in Nebraska or any
16 wholesale customers in violation of section 70-1002.02, such

19 supplier has complied with Chapter 70, article 10.
20 (2) If the executive director of the board determines that a private
21 electric supplier commenced construction of a privately developed
22 renewable energy generation facility less than thirty days prior to
