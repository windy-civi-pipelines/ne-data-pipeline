17 contemporaneously with the generator interconnection agreement or other
18 directives of the applicable regional transmission organization with
19 jurisdiction over the addition or upgrade of transmission, upon terms
20 consistent with prudent electric utility practices for the
21 interconnection of renewable generation facilities, the electric
22 supplier's reasonable transmission interconnection requirements, and
23 applicable transmission design and construction standards. The electric
24 supplier shall have the right to purchase and own transmission facilities
25 as set forth in the joint transmission development agreement. The private
26 electric supplier of the privately developed renewable energy generation
27 facility shall have the right to construct any necessary facilities or
28 improvements set forth in the joint transmission development agreement
29 pursuant to the standards set forth in the agreement at the private
30 electric supplier's cost.
31 (3) Within ten days after receipt of a written notice complying with

1 subsection (2) of this section, the executive director of the board shall
2 issue a written acknowledgment that the privately developed renewable
3 energy generation facility is exempt from sections 70-1012 to 70-1014.01
4 if such facility remains in compliance with the requirements of this
5 section.
6 (4) The exemption allowed under this section for a privately
7 developed renewable energy generation facility shall extend to and exempt
8 all private electric suppliers owning any interest in the facility,
9 including any successor private electric supplier which subsequently
10 acquires any interest in the facility.
11 (5) No property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
12 developed renewable energy generation facility shall be subject to
13 eminent domain by a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the
14 State of Nebraska. Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant
15 the power of eminent domain to a private electric supplier or limit the
16 rights of any entity to acquire any public, municipal, or utility right-
17 of-way across property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
18 developed renewable energy generation facility as long as the right-of-
19 way does not prevent the operation of or access to the privately
20 developed renewable energy generation facility.
21 (6) Only a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the State
22 of Nebraska may exercise eminent domain authority to acquire the land
23 rights necessary for the construction of transmission lines and related
24 facilities. There is a rebuttable presumption that the exercise of
25 eminent domain to provide needed transmission lines and related
26 facilities for a privately developed renewable energy generation facility
27 is a public use.
28 (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
29 private electric supplier to sell or deliver electricity at retail in
30 Nebraska.
31 (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
-12-

2025 2025
1 authority of or require a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in
2 the State of Nebraska to enter into a joint agreement with a private
3 electric supplier to develop, construct, and jointly own a privately
4 developed renewable energy generation facility.
5 Sec. 4. Section 70-1015, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
6 2024, is amended to read:
7 70-1015 (1) If any supplier violates Chapter 70, article 10, by
8 either (a) commencing the construction or finalizing or attempting to
9 finalize the acquisition of any generation facilities, any transmission
10 lines, or any related facilities without first providing notice or
11 obtaining board approval, whichever is required, or (b) serving or
12 attempting to serve at retail any customers located in Nebraska or any
13 wholesale customers in violation of section 70-1002.02, such
14 construction, acquisition, or service of such customers shall be enjoined
15 in an action brought in the name of the State of Nebraska until such
16 supplier has complied with Chapter 70, article 10.
17 (2) If the executive director of the board determines that a private
18 electric supplier commenced construction of a privately developed
19 renewable energy generation facility less than thirty days prior to
20 providing the notice and certification required in subdivisions
21 subdivision (2)(a) and (b) of section 70-1014.02, the executive director
22 shall send notice via certified mail to the private electric supplier,
23 informing it of the determination that the private electric supplier is
24 in violation of such subdivision and is subject to a fine in the amount
25 of five hundred dollars. The private electric supplier shall have twenty
26 days from the date on which the notice is received in which to submit the
27 notice and certification described in such subdivisions subdivision and
28 to pay the fine. Within ten days after the private electric supplier
29 submits a notice and certification compliant with subsection (2) of
30 section 70-1014.02 and payment of the fine, the executive director of the
31 board shall issue the written acknowledgment described in subsection (3)
-13-

LB43 LB43
2025 2025
1 of section 70-1014.02. If the private electric supplier fails to submit a
2 notice and certification compliant with subsection (2) of section
3 70-1014.02 and pay the fine within twenty days after the date on which
4 the private electric supplier receives the notice from the executive
5 director of the board, the private electric supplier shall immediately
6 cease construction or operation of the privately developed renewable
7 energy generation facility.
8 (3) If the private electric supplier disputes that construction was
9 commenced less than thirty days prior to submitting the written notice
10 and certification required by subdivisions subdivision (2)(a) and (b) of
11 section 70-1014.02, the private electric supplier may request a hearing
12 before the board. Such request shall be submitted within twenty days
13 after the private electric supplier receives the notice sent by the
14 executive director pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. If the
15 private electric supplier does not accept the certified mail sent
16 pursuant to such subsection, the executive director shall send a second
17 notice to the private electric supplier by first-class United States
18 mail. The private electric supplier may submit a request for hearing
19 within twenty days after the date on which the second notice was mailed.
20 (4) Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the board shall set a
21 hearing date. Such hearing shall be held within sixty days after such
22 receipt. The board shall provide to the private electric supplier written
23 notice of the hearing at least twenty days prior to the date of the
24 hearing. The board or its hearing officer may grant continuances upon
25 good cause shown or upon the request of the private electric supplier.
26 Timely filing of a request for hearing by a private electric supplier
27 shall stay any further enforcement under this section until the board
28 issues an order pursuant to subsection (5) of this section or the request
29 for hearing is withdrawn.
30 (5) The board shall issue a written decision within sixty days after
31 conclusion of the hearing. All costs of the hearing shall be paid by the

2 electric supplier commenced construction of the privately developed
3 renewable energy generation facility less than thirty days prior to
4 submitting the written notice and certification required pursuant to
5 subsection (2) of section 70-1014.02 or (b) the private electric supplier
6 withdraws its request for hearing prior to the board issuing its
7 decision.
8 (6) A private electric supplier which the board finds to be in
9 violation of the requirements of subsection (2) of section 70-1014.02
10 shall either (a) pay the fine described in this section and submit a
11 notice and certification compliant with subsection (2) of section
12 70-1014.02 or (b) immediately cease construction or operation of the
13 privately developed renewable energy generation facility.
14 Sec. 5. Original sections 70-1001.01, 70-1012, 70-1014.02, and
15 70-1015, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
