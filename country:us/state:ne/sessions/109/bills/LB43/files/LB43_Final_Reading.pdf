29 (A) There is no other reasonable option for procuring such equipment
30 or components; and
31 (B) Not procuring or using such equipment or components would cause
-10-

LB43 LB43
2025 2025

9 (d) (c) A joint transmission development agreement shall be entered
10 into to address construction, ownership, operation, and maintenance of

13 transmission development agreement shall be negotiated and executed
14 contemporaneously with the generator interconnection agreement or other
15 directives of the applicable regional transmission organization with
16 jurisdiction over the addition or upgrade of transmission, upon terms
17 consistent with prudent electric utility practices for the
18 interconnection of renewable generation facilities, the electric
19 supplier's reasonable transmission interconnection requirements, and
20 applicable transmission design and construction standards. The electric
21 supplier shall have the right to purchase and own transmission facilities
22 as set forth in the joint transmission development agreement. The private
23 electric supplier of the privately developed renewable energy generation

1 if such facility remains in compliance with the requirements of this
2 section.
3 (4) The exemption allowed under this section for a privately
4 developed renewable energy generation facility shall extend to and exempt
5 all private electric suppliers owning any interest in the facility,
6 including any successor private electric supplier which subsequently
7 acquires any interest in the facility.
8 (5) No property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
9 developed renewable energy generation facility shall be subject to
10 eminent domain by a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the
11 State of Nebraska. Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant
12 the power of eminent domain to a private electric supplier or limit the
13 rights of any entity to acquire any public, municipal, or utility right-
14 of-way across property owned, used, or operated as part of a privately
15 developed renewable energy generation facility as long as the right-of-
16 way does not prevent the operation of or access to the privately
17 developed renewable energy generation facility.
18 (6) Only a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in the State
19 of Nebraska may exercise eminent domain authority to acquire the land
20 rights necessary for the construction of transmission lines and related
21 facilities. There is a rebuttable presumption that the exercise of
22 eminent domain to provide needed transmission lines and related
23 facilities for a privately developed renewable energy generation facility
24 is a public use.
25 (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a
26 private electric supplier to sell or deliver electricity at retail in
27 Nebraska.
28 (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
29 authority of or require a consumer-owned electric supplier operating in
30 the State of Nebraska to enter into a joint agreement with a private
31 electric supplier to develop, construct, and jointly own a privately
-12-

9 attempting to serve at retail any customers located in Nebraska or any
10 wholesale customers in violation of section 70-1002.02, such
11 construction, acquisition, or service of such customers shall be enjoined

19 shall send notice via certified mail to the private electric supplier,
20 informing it of the determination that the private electric supplier is
21 in violation of such subdivisions subdivision and is subject to a fine in
22 the amount of five hundred dollars. The private electric supplier shall

6 commenced less than thirty days prior to submitting the written notice
7 and certification required by subdivisions subdivision (2)(a) and (b) of
8 section 70-1014.02, the private electric supplier may request a hearing
9 before the board. Such request shall be submitted within twenty days
10 after the private electric supplier receives the notice sent by the
11 executive director pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. If the
12 private electric supplier does not accept the certified mail sent
