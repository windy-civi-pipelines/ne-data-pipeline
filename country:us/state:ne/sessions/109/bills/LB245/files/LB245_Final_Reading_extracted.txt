1 (11) Test annually and at the request of the Nebraska State Patrol
2 all weighing and measuring devices used for the enforcement of sections
3 60-3,144, 60-3,147, and 60-6,294. The agency responsible for such

6 upon completion of the test;
7 (12) Approve for use and may mark commercial weighing and measuring
8 devices which the director finds to be correct and shall reject and mark

12 measuring devices that have been rejected may be seized if not made

-16-
LB245 LB245
2025 2025
1 determines in the case of a specific commodity that an existing practice
2 of declaring the quantity by weight, measure, numerical count, or
3 combination thereof does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers or
4 offers an opportunity for consumer confusion;
5 (16) Allow reasonable variations from the stated quantity of
6 contents which shall include those caused by loss or gain of moisture
7 during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable
8 deviations in good manufacturing practice only after the commodity has

11 sale systems, as deemed necessary, to determine: (a) The accuracy of
12 prices, quantity, and computations; (b) the correct use of the equipment;

31 be set by the director on or before July 1 of each year. The director may
-17-

1 raise or lower the device inspection fees each year to meet the criteria
2 in this subdivision, but the fee shall not be greater than the amount in
3 column B of subdivision (20)(c)(ii) of this section. The same percentage
4 shall be applied to each device category for all device inspection fee

9 end cash fund balances as follows:

3 section to pay an administrative fee of fifty twenty-five percent of the

21 department as provided in the Weights and Measures Act; whether the
22 applicant is an individual, partnership, limited liability company,
23 corporation, or other legal entity; and the location and type of all
24 commercial weighing and measuring devices. An application for a permit
25 shall be made prior to the operation of a weighing and measuring
26 establishment. The application shall be accompanied by a one-time permit
27 fee of five dollars and the annual device registration and device
28 inspection fees required in section 89-187. The full annual device
29 registration and device inspection fees are required regardless of when
30 during the year the device is put into operation.

3 permanent location for commercial weighing and measuring devices shall
4 have a valid permit posted in a conspicuous place at the establishment,
5 and there shall not be a change in ownership, location, or business name
6 without the permitholder obtaining a new permit. Any permit for such
7 establishment shall lapse automatically upon a change of ownership,
8 location, or business name.
9 (2) A weighing and measuring establishment which does not have a
10 permanent location for commercial weighing and measuring devices shall
11 have a copy of a valid permit posted on or about each device and shall
12 not have a change in ownership, business name, or permanent mailing
13 address without the permitholder obtaining a new permit. Any permit for
14 such establishment shall lapse automatically upon a change of ownership,
15 business name, or permanent mailing address.
16 (3) The holder of any weighing and measuring establishment permit
17 shall notify the department in writing at least thirty days prior to any
18 change requiring a new permit under subsection (1) or (2) of this
19 section. A permitholder shall notify the department in writing before
20 there is a change of the name or address of the person authorized to
21 receive notices and orders of the department. When an establishment is to
22 be permanently closed, the permitholder shall return the permit to the
23 department within one week after the closing.

9 (2) A weighing and measuring establishment which does not have a
10 permanent location for commercial weighing and measuring devices shall
11 have a copy of a valid permit posted on or about each device and shall
12 not have a change in ownership, business name, or permanent mailing
13 address without the permitholder obtaining a new permit. Any permit for
14 such establishment shall lapse automatically upon a change of ownership,
15 business name, or permanent mailing address.
16 (3) The holder of any weighing and measuring establishment permit
17 shall notify the department in writing at least thirty days prior to any
