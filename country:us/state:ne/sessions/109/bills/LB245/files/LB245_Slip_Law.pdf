(2) A weighing and measuring establishment which does not have a permanent
location for commercial weighing and measuring devices shall have a copy of a
valid permit posted on or about each device and shall not have a change in
ownership, business name, or permanent mailing address without the permitholder

address.
(3) The holder of any weighing and measuring establishment permit shall
notify the department in writing at least thirty days prior to any change
requiring a new permit under subsection (1) or (2) of this section. A

the name or address of the person authorized to receive notices and orders of
the department. When an establishment is to be permanently closed, the
permitholder shall return the permit to the department within one week after
the closing.
