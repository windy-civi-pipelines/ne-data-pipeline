6 Sec. 2. (1) For school fiscal year 2025-26 and each school fiscal

8 funding to be paid to each school district in accordance with this
9 section.
10 (2) A district shall receive military impact funding in an amount
11 calculated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section if the district
12 received a basic support payment of federal impact aid under section 7003
13 of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the
14 school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which
15 the aid is to be calculated and the district provides free public

17 duty in the uniformed services.
18 (3) For purposes of the calculation of military impact funding
19 pursuant to this section:

22 payment of federal impact aid under section 7003 of the federal
23 Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the school fiscal year
24 immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which the aid is to be

27 the district as of the day of the fall membership count pursuant to
28 section 79-528; and
29 (b) Per-pupil general fund tax levy means the amount calculated by

2 parents are on active duty in the uniformed services and who otherwise
3 are included in the calculation of the fall membership.
4 (4)(a) The amount of military impact funding provided to a district
5 shall be calculated by (i) subtracting the per-pupil federal impact aid
6 from the per-pupil general fund tax levy and (ii) multiplying the amount
7 calculated in subdivision (a)(i) of this subsection by the number of
8 federally connected children whose parents are on active duty in the
9 uniformed services actually enrolled in the district as of the day of the
10 fall membership count pursuant to section 79-528.
11 (b) A district's military impact funding shall be zero if the amount
