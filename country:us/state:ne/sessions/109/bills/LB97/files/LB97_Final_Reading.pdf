3 29-2292 (1) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of
4 conviction may be rendered, a defendant may request the court defer the
5 entry of judgment of conviction. Upon such request and after giving the
6 prosecutor and defendant the opportunity to be heard, the court may defer

8 and place the defendant on probation, upon conditions as the court may
