7 entry of judgment of conviction. Upon such request and after giving the
8 prosecutor and defendant the opportunity to be heard, the court may defer
9 the entry of a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence
10 and place the defendant on probation, upon conditions as the court may
11 require under section 29-2262.

14 (b) The victim of the offense is an intimate partner as defined in
15 section 28-323;
16 (c) The offense is a violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197 or a

20 (e) For any driver holding a commercial driver's license or CLP-
21 commercial learner's permit issued pursuant to the Motor Vehicle
22 Operator's License Act, such deferred judgment would mask the conviction
23 and lead to noncompliance with federal law or regulation and subject this
24 state to possible loss of federal money.
25 (3) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment, the
26 court shall consider the factors set forth in section 29-2260 and any
27 other information the court deems relevant.
