5 29-2292 (1) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of
6 conviction may be rendered, a defendant may request the court defer the
7 entry of judgment of conviction. Upon such request and after giving the
8 prosecutor and defendant the opportunity to be heard, the court may defer
9 the entry of a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence
10 and place the defendant on probation, upon conditions as the court may
11 require under section 29-2262.
12 (2) The court shall not defer judgment under this section if:
13 (a) The offense is a violation of section 42-924;
14 (b) The victim of the offense is an intimate partner as defined in
15 section 28-323;
16 (c) The offense is a violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197 or a
17 city or village ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or
18 60-6,197; or
19 (d) The defendant is not eligible for probation; or .
20 (e) For any driver holding a commercial driver's license or CLP-
21 commercial learner's permit issued pursuant to the Motor Vehicle
22 Operator's License Act, such deferred judgment would mask the conviction
23 and lead to noncompliance with federal law or regulation and subject this
24 state to possible loss of federal money.
25 (3) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment, the
26 court shall consider the factors set forth in section 29-2260 and any
27 other information the court deems relevant.

6 opportunity to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated
7 a condition of his or her probation, the court may enter any order
8 authorized by section 29-2268 or pronounce judgment and impose such new
9 sentence as might have been originally imposed for the offense for which

MJP - 03/20/2025 MJP - 03/20/2025
E AND R AMENDMENTS TO LB 97
Introduced by Guereca, 7, Chairman Enrollment and Review
1 1. Strike the original sections and all amendments thereto and
2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Section 29-2292, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
4 2024, is amended to read:
5 29-2292 (1) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of
6 conviction may be rendered, a defendant may request the court defer the
7 entry of judgment of conviction. Upon such request and after giving the
8 prosecutor and defendant the opportunity to be heard, the court may defer
9 the entry of a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence
10 and place the defendant on probation, upon conditions as the court may
11 require under section 29-2262.
12 (2) The court shall not defer judgment under this section if:
13 (a) The offense is a violation of section 42-924;
14 (b) The victim of the offense is an intimate partner as defined in
15 section 28-323;
16 (c) The offense is a violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197 or a
17 city or village ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or
18 60-6,197; or
19 (d) The defendant is not eligible for probation; or .
20 (e) For any driver holding a commercial driver's license or CLP-
21 commercial learner's permit issued pursuant to the Motor Vehicle
22 Operator's License Act, such deferred judgment would mask the conviction
23 and lead to noncompliance with federal law or regulation and subject this
24 state to possible loss of federal money.
25 (3) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment, the
26 court shall consider the factors set forth in section 29-2260 and any
27 other information the court deems relevant.

MJP - 03/20/2025 MJP - 03/20/2025
1 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections
2 29-2293 and 29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant
3 to a deferred judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation
4 Administration Act and sections 29-2270 to 29-2273.
5 (5) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an
6 opportunity to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated
7 a condition of his or her probation, the court may enter any order
8 authorized by section 29-2268 or pronounce judgment and impose such new
9 sentence as might have been originally imposed for the offense for which
10 the defendant was convicted.
11 (6) Upon satisfactory completion of the conditions of probation and
12 the payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed
13 under section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to
14 withdraw any plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action
15 without entry of judgment.
16 (7) The provisions of this section apply to offenses committed on or
17 after July 1, 2020. For purposes of this section, an offense shall be
18 deemed to have been committed prior to July 1, 2020, if any element of
19 the offense occurred prior to such date.
20 Sec. 2. Section 37-1201, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
21 2024, is amended to read:
22 37-1201 Sections 37-1201 to 37-12,110 and sections 4 and 5 of this
23 act shall be known and may be cited as the State Boat Act. It is the
24 policy of this state to promote safety for persons and property in and
25 connected with the use, operation, and equipment of vessels and to
26 promote uniformity of laws relating thereto.
27 Sec. 3. Section 37-1202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 37-1202 For the purposes of the State Boat Act, unless the context
30 otherwise requires, the definitions found in sections 37-1203 to 37-1210

2 transport viable on land and on or under water.
3 Sec. 5. Sections 37-1211 to 37-1231 and 37-1275 to 37-12,108 shall

5 has been issued for such amphibious vehicle under the Motor Vehicle

7 Sec. 6. Section 37-1284, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
8 amended to read:

17 title to the person entitled to receive the certificate of title. If the
18 county treasurer's records of the title have been destroyed pursuant to
19 section 37-1279, the county treasurer shall issue a duplicate certificate
20 of title to the person entitled to receive the certificate upon such
21 showing as the county treasurer deems sufficient. If the applicant cannot
22 produce such proof of ownership, he or she may apply directly to the
23 department and submit such evidence as he or she may have, and the
24 department may, if it finds the evidence sufficient, authorize the county
25 treasurer to issue a duplicate certificate of title. The new purchaser
26 shall be entitled to receive an original title upon presentation of the
27 assigned duplicate copy of the certificate of title, properly assigned to
28 the new purchaser, to the county treasurer as prescribed in section
29 37-1278. Any purchaser of the motorboat may at the time of purchase
30 require the seller of the motorboat to indemnify him or her and all
31 subsequent purchasers of the motorboat against any loss which he, she, or
