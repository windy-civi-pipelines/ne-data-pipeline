be rendered, a defendant may request the court defer the entry of judgment of
conviction. Upon such request and after giving the prosecutor and defendant the
opportunity to be heard, the court may defer the entry of a judgment of
conviction and the imposition of a sentence and place the defendant on

information the court deems relevant.

29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant to a deferred
judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation Administration Act and

(5) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an opportunity
to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated a condition of his
or her probation, the court may enter any order authorized by section 29-2268

payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed under
section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to withdraw any
plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action without entry of
judgment.

2025 2025
amended to read:
60-6,211.05 (1) If an order is granted under section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197
and sections 60-6,197.02 and 60-6,197.03, the court may order that the
defendant install an ignition interlock device of a type approved by the
Director of Motor Vehicles on each motor vehicle operated by the defendant
during the period of revocation. Upon sufficient evidence of installation, the
defendant may apply to the director for an ignition interlock permit pursuant
to section 60-4,118.06. The device shall, without tampering or the intervention
of another person, prevent the defendant from operating the motor vehicle when
the defendant has an alcohol concentration greater than three-hundredths of one
gram or more by weight of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of his or her
blood or three-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of his or her breath. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall
issue an ignition interlock permit to the defendant under section 60-4,118.06
only upon sufficient proof that a defendant has installed an ignition interlock
device on any motor vehicle that the defendant will operate during his or her
release.
(2) If the court orders installation of an ignition interlock device and
issuance of an ignition interlock permit pursuant to subsection (1) of this
section, the court may also order the use of a continuous alcohol monitoring
device and abstention from alcohol use at all times. The device shall, without
tampering or the intervention of another person, test and record the alcohol
consumption level of the defendant on a periodic basis and transmit such
information to probation authorities.
(3)(a) Prior to January 1, 2026, any (3) Any order issued by the court
pursuant to this section shall not take effect until the defendant is eligible
to operate a motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (8) of section 60-498.01. A
person shall be eligible to be issued an ignition interlock permit allowing
operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device if he
or she is not subject to any other suspension, cancellation, required no-
driving period, or period of revocation and has successfully completed the
ignition interlock permit application process. The Department of Motor Vehicles
shall review its records and the driving record abstract of any person who
applies for an ignition interlock permit allowing operation of a motor vehicle
equipped with an ignition interlock device to determine (i) (a) the applicant's
eligibility for an ignition interlock permit, (ii) (b) the applicant's previous
convictions under section 60-6,196, 60-6,197, or 60-6,197.06 or any previous
administrative license revocation, if any, and (iii) (c) if the applicant is
subject to any required no-drive periods before the ignition interlock permit
may be issued.
(b) Beginning January 1, 2026, any order issued by the court, or issued
pursuant to a court order or administrative license revocation order from
another jurisdiction that substantially complies with this section and section
60-6,197.03, shall not take effect until the defendant is eligible to operate a
motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (8) of section 60-498.01. A person shall
be eligible to be issued an ignition interlock permit allowing operation of a
motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device if he or she is not
subject to any other suspension, cancellation, required no-driving period, or
period of revocation and has successfully completed the ignition interlock
permit application process. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall, before the
ignition interlock permit may be issued, review its records and the driving
record abstract of any person who applies for an ignition interlock permit
allowing operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock
device to determine (i) the applicant's eligibility for an ignition interlock
permit, (ii) the applicant's previous convictions under section 60-6,196,
60-6,197, or 60-6,197.06 or any previous administrative license revocation, if
any, and (iii) if the applicant is subject to any required no-drive periods.
(4)(a) If the court orders an ignition interlock device or the Board of
Pardons orders an ignition interlock device under section 83-1,127.02, the
court or the Board of Pardons shall order the defendant to apply for an
ignition interlock permit as provided in section 60-4,118.06 which indicates
that the defendant is only allowed to operate a motor vehicle equipped with an
ignition interlock device.
(b) Such court order shall remain in effect for a period of time as
determined by the court not to exceed the maximum term of revocation which the
court could have imposed according to the nature of the violation and shall
allow operation by the defendant of only an ignition-interlock-equipped motor
vehicle.
(c) Such Board of Pardons order shall remain in effect for a period of
time not to exceed any period of revocation the applicant is subject to at the
time the application for a reprieve is made.
(5) Any person restricted to operating a motor vehicle equipped with an
ignition interlock device, pursuant to a Board of Pardons order, who operates
upon the highways of this state a motor vehicle without such device or if the
device has been disabled, bypassed, or altered in any way, shall be punished as
provided in subsection (3) of section 83-1,127.02.
(6) If a person ordered to use a continuous alcohol monitoring device and
abstain from alcohol use pursuant to a court order as provided in subsection
(2) of this section violates the provisions of such court order by removing,
tampering with, or otherwise bypassing the continuous alcohol monitoring device
or by consuming alcohol while required to use such device, he or she shall have
his or her ignition interlock permit revoked and be unable to apply for
reinstatement for the duration of the revocation period imposed by the court.

(7) The director shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
regarding the approval of ignition interlock devices, the means of installing
ignition interlock devices, and the means of administering the ignition
interlock permit program.
(8)(a) The costs incurred in order to comply with the ignition interlock
requirements of this section shall be paid directly to the ignition interlock
provider by the person complying with an order for an ignition interlock permit
and installation of an ignition interlock device.
(b) If the Department of Motor Vehicles has determined the person to be
indigent and incapable of paying for the cost of installation, removal, or
maintenance of the ignition interlock device in accordance with this section,
such costs shall be paid out of the Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition
Interlock Fund if such funds are available, according to rules and regulations
adopted and promulgated by the department. Such costs shall also be paid out of
the Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition Interlock Fund if such funds are
available and if the court or the Board of Pardons, whichever is applicable,
has determined the person to be indigent and incapable of paying for the cost
of installation, removal, or maintenance of the ignition interlock device in
accordance with this section. The Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition
Interlock Fund is created. Money in the Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition
Interlock Fund may be used for transfers to the General Fund at the direction
of the Legislature. On October 1, 2017, or as soon thereafter as
administratively possible, the State Treasurer shall transfer twenty-five
thousand dollars from the Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition Interlock Fund
to the Violence Prevention Cash Fund. On October 1, 2018, or as soon thereafter
as administratively possible, the State Treasurer shall transfer twenty-five
thousand dollars from the Department of Motor Vehicles Ignition Interlock Fund
to the Violence Prevention Cash Fund. Any money in the Department of Motor
Vehicles Ignition Interlock Fund available for investment shall be invested by
the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and
the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
(9)(a)(i) An ignition interlock service facility shall notify the
appropriate district probation office or the appropriate court, as applicable,
of any evidence of tampering with or circumvention of an ignition interlock
device, or any attempts to do so, when the facility becomes aware of such
evidence. Failure of the facility to provide notification as provided in this
subdivision is a Class V misdemeanor.
(ii) An ignition interlock service facility shall notify the Department of
Motor Vehicles, if the ignition interlock permit is issued pursuant to sections
60-498.01 to 60-498.04, of any evidence of tampering with or circumvention of
an ignition interlock device, or any attempts to do so, when the facility
becomes aware of such evidence. Failure of the facility to provide notification
as provided in this subdivision is a Class V misdemeanor.
(b) If a district probation office receives evidence of tampering with or
circumvention of an ignition interlock device, or any attempts to do so, from
an ignition interlock service facility, the district probation office shall
notify the appropriate court of such violation. The court shall immediately
schedule an evidentiary hearing to be held within fourteen days after receiving
such evidence, either from the district probation office or an ignition
interlock service facility, and the court shall cause notice of the hearing to
be given to the person operating a motor vehicle pursuant to an order under
subsection (1) of this section. If the person who is the subject of such
evidence does not appear at the hearing and show cause why the order made
pursuant to subsection (1) of this section should remain in effect, the court
shall rescind the original order. Nothing in this subsection shall apply to an
order made by the Board of Pardons pursuant to section 83-1,127.02.
(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the issuance of an
ignition interlock permit by the Department of Motor Vehicles under section
60-498.01 or an order for the installation of an ignition interlock device and
ignition interlock permit made pursuant to subsection (1) of this section as
part of a conviction, as well as the administration of such court order by the
Office of Probation Administration for the installation, maintenance, and
removal of such device, as applicable, shall not be construed to create an
order of probation when an order of probation has not been issued.
Sec. 41. Section 60-1513, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
60-1513 The Department of Motor Vehicles Cash Fund is hereby created. The
fund shall be administered by the Director of Motor Vehicles. In addition to
money paid to the department or credited or remitted to the fund, the fund may
also receive reimbursement from counties. The fund shall be used by the
Department of Motor Vehicles to carry out its duties as deemed necessary by the
Director of Motor Vehicles, except that transfers from the fund to the General
Fund or the Vehicle Title and Registration System Replacement and Maintenance
Cash Fund may be made at the direction of the Legislature. Any money in the
Department of Motor Vehicles Cash Fund available for investment shall be

Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act. Beginning October 1,
2024, any investment earnings from investment of money in the fund shall be
