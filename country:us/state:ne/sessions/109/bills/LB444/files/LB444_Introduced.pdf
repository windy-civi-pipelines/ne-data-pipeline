10 at such carrier's principal place of business of surety bonds, policies
11 of insurance, qualifications as a self-insurer, or other securities or
12 agreements, in such reasonable amount as required by the commission,
13 conditioned to pay, within the amount of such surety bonds, policies of
14 insurance, qualifications as a self-insurer, or other securities or
15 agreements, any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for
16 bodily injuries to or the death of any person resulting from the
17 negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles under such
18 certificate, permit, or license or for loss or damage to property of
19 others. No certificate or permit shall be issued to a common or contract
20 carrier, no license shall be issued to a motor carrier transporting

2 commission, to be conditioned upon such carrier making compensation to
3 shippers or consignees for all property belonging to shippers or
