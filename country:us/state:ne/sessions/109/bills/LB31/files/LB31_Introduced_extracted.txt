1 Section 1. (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:
2 (a) The use of student surveillance, monitoring, and tracking
3 technology tools by school districts, other governmental entities, and
4 companies contracting with schools for the use of student surveys and

8 (b) The intersection of government and technology companies
9 utilizing tools of mass surveillance raises concerns regarding civil
10 rights and civil liberties;
11 (c) Numerous public schools in Nebraska have instituted various

13 include, but are not limited to, digital hall passes, anti-vaping
14 devices, fingerprints swipes, cameras, and electronic surveys;
15 (d) Tools of mass surveillance are being purchased and utilized with
16 taxpayer funds through contracts with private companies;
17 (e) Certain tools of mass surveillance may be of legitimate use for
18 educational purposes and certain technologies can advance the public
19 policy goals of student success and school safety; and
20 (f) Parents have a well-established and fundamental right to control
21 their children's education. Students have a well-established and
22 fundamental right to privacy from unwarranted government surveillance.
23 Taxpayers have a well-established right to ensure public entities are
24 good stewards of public funds and a well-established right to
25 transparency for governmental operations and expenditures.
26 (2) The Legislature further finds that public funds should be
27 primarily dedicated to frontline classroom needs and that tools of mass
28 surveillance that are purchased for use in schools under the guise of
29 advancing security or efficiency goals should not compromise personal
30 liberty or evade citizen transparency.
