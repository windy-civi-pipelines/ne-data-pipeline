28 regardless of consequences assigned; and
29 (iii) Act resulting in law enforcement involvement, including any
30 incident reported to law enforcement or to an onsite school resource

-10-

LB417 LB417

4 a school being used for a school purpose or in a vehicle being driven for
5 a school purpose by a school employee or by such employee's designee; or
6 at a school-sponsored activity or athletic event.
7 (c) The system for tracking individual student discipline may also
8 be used to record other disciplinary incidents.
9 (d) Each school shall designate at least one discipline data
10 coordinator for the purposes of gathering and reporting the discipline
11 data required pursuant to this subsection.
12 (3) The department shall annually analyze and report on student

17 Legislature, school districts, educational service units, and each
