24 funds. An intermittent furlough is a furlough action in which the
25 nonduty, nonpay status occurs discontinuously over a period of time
26 rather than consecutively. It is further intended that furloughs shall
27 not adversely affect the employee and employer health insurance premium
28 contributions and service anniversary date, nor shall leave earnings be
29 prorated as a result of the furlough.
30 Sec. 12. It is the intent of the Legislature that the
31 appropriations for capital facilities follow an orderly and reasonable
-6-

LB261 LB261

2 utilization of existing facilities.
3 The biennial appropriations contained in this act covering FY2025-26
4 and FY2026-27, which have been designated for planning, require from the
5 agency a complete program statement prepared in accordance with the
6 Procedural Manual for Capital Construction Projects as approved by the
7 state building division of the Department of Administrative Services.
8 Projects directly related to program continuation such as fire and life
9 safety, maintenance, utility improvements, handicapped access, and master
10 planning require a statement of needs prepared in accordance with the
11 manual. An appropriation for drawings and construction may be recommended
12 only after submission of an acceptable program statement or statement of
13 needs on or before September 15 to the state building division, the
14 budget division of the Department of Administrative Services, and the
15 Legislative Fiscal Analyst.
16 Program statements that have been submitted prior to FY2025-26 shall
17 be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the period July 1, 2025,
18 to September 1, 2025. Program statements that have been submitted prior
19 to FY2026-27 shall be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the
20 period July 1, 2026, to September 1, 2026, by agency priority. Such
21 priority shall be subject to final modification by the governing
22 authority of each agency on or before September 15, 2026.
23 Sec. 13. It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies should
24 construct or renovate facilities in such a manner as to provide the
25 greatest cost-effective energy savings possible. Design criteria
26 emphasizing efficiency, functionality, and energy conservation shall be
27 reflected in program statements, schematic design documents, design
28 development documents, and construction documents. The state building
29 division of the Department of Administrative Services and the Department
30 of Environment and Energy shall provide technical assistance to the state
31 agencies, upon request, to assist them in providing for energy-efficient
