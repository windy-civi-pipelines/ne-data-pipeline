25 vacation, holidays, sick leave, military leave, funeral leave, maternity
26 leave, administrative leave, compensatory time, deferred compensation, or

-4-

LB261 LB261
2025 2025
1 excess of the amount shown are available and approved by the Governor.
2 Expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems from such
3 grants shall be in addition to the limitation on permanent and temporary
4 salaries and per diems otherwise shown in this act. No agency shall
5 request any state funds for continuation or replacement of any such
6 personnel or activities in future budget requests. To the extent
7 feasible, requests for increases in the limitation on permanent and
8 temporary salaries and per diems shall be addressed to the Appropriations
9 Committee of the Legislature when the Legislature is in session.
10 (3) Expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries resulting from

13 diems otherwise shown in this act.

22 salaries and per diems for FY2026-27 shall be increased by certified

31 Department of Administrative Services may administratively increase the
-5-

LB261 LB261
2025 2025
1 limitation on expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per
2 diems upon receipt of a request for such increase from the director of a
3 state agency certifying the actual amount of the payment to a former
4 employee of such agency, or such employee's beneficiary upon the death of
5 the employee, of accumulated vacation and sick leave pursuant to section
6 81-1325 and the rules and regulations of the State Personnel System
7 governing such payments.
8 Sec. 11. It is the intent of the Legislature that state agencies
9 may, at their discretion, utilize employee furloughs as a short-term
10 means of addressing budgetary shortfalls. Furlough is defined as placing
11 an employee in a temporary, nonduty, nonpay status because of the lack of
12 funds. An intermittent furlough is a furlough action in which the
13 nonduty, nonpay status occurs discontinuously over a period of time
14 rather than consecutively. It is further intended that furloughs shall
15 not adversely affect the employee and employer health insurance premium
16 contributions and service anniversary date, nor shall leave earnings be
17 prorated as a result of the furlough.
18 Sec. 12. It is the intent of the Legislature that the
19 appropriations for capital facilities follow an orderly and reasonable
20 process based upon defined and documented need and an analysis of the
21 utilization of existing facilities.
22 The biennial appropriations contained in this act covering FY2025-26
23 and FY2026-27, which have been designated for planning, require from the
24 agency a complete program statement prepared in accordance with the
25 Procedural Manual for Capital Construction Projects as approved by the
26 state building division of the Department of Administrative Services.
27 Projects directly related to program continuation such as fire and life
28 safety, maintenance, utility improvements, handicapped access, and master
29 planning require a statement of needs prepared in accordance with the
30 manual. An appropriation for drawings and construction may be recommended
31 only after submission of an acceptable program statement or statement of
-6-

LB261 LB261
2025 2025
1 needs on or before September 15 to the state building division, the
2 budget division of the Department of Administrative Services, and the
3 Legislative Fiscal Analyst.
4 Program statements that have been submitted prior to FY2025-26 shall
5 be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the period July 1, 2025,
6 to September 1, 2025. Program statements that have been submitted prior
7 to FY2026-27 shall be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the
8 period July 1, 2026, to September 1, 2026, by agency priority. Such
9 priority shall be subject to final modification by the governing
10 authority of each agency on or before September 15, 2026.
11 Sec. 13. It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies should
12 construct or renovate facilities in such a manner as to provide the
13 greatest cost-effective energy savings possible. Design criteria
14 emphasizing efficiency, functionality, and energy conservation shall be
15 reflected in program statements, schematic design documents, design
16 development documents, and construction documents. The state building
17 division of the Department of Administrative Services and the Department
18 of Water, Energy, and Environment shall provide technical assistance to
19 the state agencies, upon request, to assist them in providing for energy-
20 efficient new or renovated facilities.
