2025 2025
the Department of Administrative Services, expenditures of funds from any gift

This section shall not apply to the University of Nebraska.
Sec. 10. LIMITATION ON SALARIES, WAGES, AND PER DIEMS.
(1) For purposes of this act, (a) SALARY LIMIT shall mean total
expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems and (b) total
expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems shall mean all
remuneration paid to employees treated as taxable compensation by the Internal
Revenue Service or subject to social security coverage, specifically including
payments accounted for as vacation, holidays, sick leave, military leave,
funeral leave, maternity leave, administrative leave, compensatory time,
deferred compensation, or any other similar form, and amounts withheld pursuant
to law, but excluding state contributions for social security, retirement, and
employee insurance plans.
(2) Total expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems
shall be limited to the amount shown except when federal funds in excess of the
amount shown are available and approved by the Governor. Expenditures for
permanent and temporary salaries and per diems from such grants shall be in
addition to the limitation on permanent and temporary salaries and per diems
otherwise shown in this act. No agency shall request any state funds for
continuation or replacement of any such personnel or activities in future
budget requests. To the extent feasible, requests for increases in the
limitation on permanent and temporary salaries and per diems shall be addressed
to the Appropriations Committee of the Legislature when the Legislature is in
session.
(3) Expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries resulting from

and per diems shall only apply to remuneration paid to state employees or per
diem payments made to members of state boards or commissions.
(7) The budget administrator of the budget division of the Department of
Administrative Services may administratively increase the limitation on
expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems upon receipt of
a request for such increase from the director of a state agency certifying the
actual amount of the payment to a former employee of such agency, or such
employee's beneficiary upon the death of the employee, of accumulated vacation
and sick leave pursuant to section 81-1325 and the rules and regulations of the
State Personnel System governing such payments.
Sec. 11. It is the intent of the Legislature that state agencies may, at
their discretion, utilize employee furloughs as a short-term means of
addressing budgetary shortfalls. Furlough is defined as placing an employee in
a temporary, nonduty, nonpay status because of the lack of funds. An
intermittent furlough is a furlough action in which the nonduty, nonpay status
occurs discontinuously over a period of time rather than consecutively. It is
further intended that furloughs shall not adversely affect the employee and
employer health insurance premium contributions and service anniversary date,
nor shall leave earnings be prorated as a result of the furlough.
Sec. 12. It is the intent of the Legislature that the appropriations for
capital facilities follow an orderly and reasonable process based upon defined
and documented need and an analysis of the utilization of existing facilities.
The biennial appropriations contained in this act covering FY2025-26 and
FY2026-27, which have been designated for planning, require from the agency a
complete program statement prepared in accordance with the Procedural Manual
for Capital Construction Projects as approved by the state building division of
the Department of Administrative Services. Projects directly related to program
continuation such as fire and life safety, maintenance, utility improvements,
handicapped access, and master planning require a statement of needs prepared
in accordance with the manual. An appropriation for drawings and construction
may be recommended only after submission of an acceptable program statement or
statement of needs on or before September 15 to the state building division,
the budget division of the Department of Administrative Services, and the
Legislative Fiscal Analyst.
Program statements that have been submitted prior to FY2025-26 shall be
-2-
LB261 LB261
2025 2025
updated if necessary and resubmitted during the period July 1, 2025, to
September 1, 2025. Program statements that have been submitted prior to
FY2026-27 shall be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the period July
1, 2026, to September 1, 2026, by agency priority. Such priority shall be
subject to final modification by the governing authority of each agency on or
before September 15, 2026.
Sec. 13. It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies should
construct or renovate facilities in such a manner as to provide the greatest
cost-effective energy savings possible. Design criteria emphasizing efficiency,
functionality, and energy conservation shall be reflected in program
statements, schematic design documents, design development documents, and
construction documents. The state building division of the Department of
Administrative Services and the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
shall provide technical assistance to the state agencies, upon request, to
assist them in providing for energy-efficient new or renovated facilities.

2025 2025
the Department of Administrative Services, expenditures of funds from any gift

This section shall not apply to the University of Nebraska.
Sec. 10. LIMITATION ON SALARIES, WAGES, AND PER DIEMS.
(1) For purposes of this act, (a) SALARY LIMIT shall mean total
expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems and (b) total
expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems shall mean all
remuneration paid to employees treated as taxable compensation by the Internal
Revenue Service or subject to social security coverage, specifically including
payments accounted for as vacation, holidays, sick leave, military leave,
funeral leave, maternity leave, administrative leave, compensatory time,
deferred compensation, or any other similar form, and amounts withheld pursuant
to law, but excluding state contributions for social security, retirement, and
employee insurance plans.
(2) Total expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems
shall be limited to the amount shown except when federal funds in excess of the
amount shown are available and approved by the Governor. Expenditures for
permanent and temporary salaries and per diems from such grants shall be in
addition to the limitation on permanent and temporary salaries and per diems
otherwise shown in this act. No agency shall request any state funds for
continuation or replacement of any such personnel or activities in future
budget requests. To the extent feasible, requests for increases in the
limitation on permanent and temporary salaries and per diems shall be addressed
to the Appropriations Committee of the Legislature when the Legislature is in
session.
(3) Expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries resulting from

diem payments made to members of state boards or commissions.
(7) The budget administrator of the budget division of the Department of
Administrative Services may administratively increase the limitation on
expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per diems upon receipt of
a request for such increase from the director of a state agency certifying the
actual amount of the payment to a former employee of such agency, or such
employee's beneficiary upon the death of the employee, of accumulated vacation
and sick leave pursuant to section 81-1325 and the rules and regulations of the
State Personnel System governing such payments.
Sec. 11. It is the intent of the Legislature that state agencies may, at
their discretion, utilize employee furloughs as a short-term means of
addressing budgetary shortfalls. Furlough is defined as placing an employee in
a temporary, nonduty, nonpay status because of the lack of funds. An
intermittent furlough is a furlough action in which the nonduty, nonpay status
occurs discontinuously over a period of time rather than consecutively. It is
further intended that furloughs shall not adversely affect the employee and
employer health insurance premium contributions and service anniversary date,
nor shall leave earnings be prorated as a result of the furlough.
Sec. 12. It is the intent of the Legislature that the appropriations for
capital facilities follow an orderly and reasonable process based upon defined
and documented need and an analysis of the utilization of existing facilities.
The biennial appropriations contained in this act covering FY2025-26 and
FY2026-27, which have been designated for planning, require from the agency a
complete program statement prepared in accordance with the Procedural Manual
for Capital Construction Projects as approved by the state building division of
the Department of Administrative Services. Projects directly related to program
continuation such as fire and life safety, maintenance, utility improvements,
handicapped access, and master planning require a statement of needs prepared
in accordance with the manual. An appropriation for drawings and construction
may be recommended only after submission of an acceptable program statement or
statement of needs on or before September 15 to the state building division,
the budget division of the Department of Administrative Services, and the
Legislative Fiscal Analyst.
Program statements that have been submitted prior to FY2025-26 shall be
-2-

2025 2025
updated if necessary and resubmitted during the period July 1, 2025, to
September 1, 2025. Program statements that have been submitted prior to
FY2026-27 shall be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the period July
1, 2026, to September 1, 2026, by agency priority. Such priority shall be
subject to final modification by the governing authority of each agency on or
before September 15, 2026.
Sec. 13. It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies should
construct or renovate facilities in such a manner as to provide the greatest
cost-effective energy savings possible. Design criteria emphasizing efficiency,
functionality, and energy conservation shall be reflected in program
statements, schematic design documents, design development documents, and
construction documents. The state building division of the Department of
Administrative Services and the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
shall provide technical assistance to the state agencies, upon request, to
assist them in providing for energy-efficient new or renovated facilities.
