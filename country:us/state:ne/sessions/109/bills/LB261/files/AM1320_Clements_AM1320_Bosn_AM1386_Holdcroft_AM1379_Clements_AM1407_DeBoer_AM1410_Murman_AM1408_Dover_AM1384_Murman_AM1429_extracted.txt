10 salaries and per diems otherwise shown in this act. No agency shall
11 request any state funds for continuation or replacement of any such

1 (6) The limitation on expenditures for permanent and temporary

5 (7) The budget administrator of the budget division of the

7 limitation on expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per
8 diems upon receipt of a request for such increase from the director of a
9 state agency certifying the actual amount of the payment to a former
10 employee of such agency, or such employee's beneficiary upon the death of

13 governing such payments.
14 Sec. 11. It is the intent of the Legislature that state agencies
15 may, at their discretion, utilize employee furloughs as a short-term
16 means of addressing budgetary shortfalls. Furlough is defined as placing
17 an employee in a temporary, nonduty, nonpay status because of the lack of
18 funds. An intermittent furlough is a furlough action in which the
19 nonduty, nonpay status occurs discontinuously over a period of time
20 rather than consecutively. It is further intended that furloughs shall
21 not adversely affect the employee and employer health insurance premium
22 contributions and service anniversary date, nor shall leave earnings be
23 prorated as a result of the furlough.
24 Sec. 12. It is the intent of the Legislature that the
25 appropriations for capital facilities follow an orderly and reasonable
26 process based upon defined and documented need and an analysis of the
27 utilization of existing facilities.
28 The biennial appropriations contained in this act covering FY2025-26
29 and FY2026-27, which have been designated for planning, require from the
30 agency a complete program statement prepared in accordance with the
31 Procedural Manual for Capital Construction Projects as approved by the

3 safety, maintenance, utility improvements, handicapped access, and master

6 only after submission of an acceptable program statement or statement of
7 needs on or before September 15 to the state building division, the
8 budget division of the Department of Administrative Services, and the
9 Legislative Fiscal Analyst.
10 Program statements that have been submitted prior to FY2025-26 shall
11 be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the period July 1, 2025,
12 to September 1, 2025. Program statements that have been submitted prior
13 to FY2026-27 shall be updated if necessary and resubmitted during the
14 period July 1, 2026, to September 1, 2026, by agency priority. Such
15 priority shall be subject to final modification by the governing
16 authority of each agency on or before September 15, 2026.
17 Sec. 13. It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies should
18 construct or renovate facilities in such a manner as to provide the
19 greatest cost-effective energy savings possible. Design criteria
20 emphasizing efficiency, functionality, and energy conservation shall be
21 reflected in program statements, schematic design documents, design
22 development documents, and construction documents. The state building
23 division of the Department of Administrative Services and the Department
24 of Water, Energy, and Environment shall provide technical assistance to
25 the state agencies, upon request, to assist them in providing for energy-
26 efficient new or renovated facilities.

1 (6) The limitation on expenditures for permanent and temporary
2 salaries and per diems shall only apply to remuneration paid to state
3 employees or per diem payments made to members of state boards or
4 commissions.
5 (7) The budget administrator of the budget division of the
6 Department of Administrative Services may administratively increase the
7 limitation on expenditures for permanent and temporary salaries and per
8 diems upon receipt of a request for such increase from the director of a
9 state agency certifying the actual amount of the payment to a former
10 employee of such agency, or such employee's beneficiary upon the death of
11 the employee, of accumulated vacation and sick leave pursuant to section
12 81-1325 and the rules and regulations of the State Personnel System
13 governing such payments.
14 Sec. 11. It is the intent of the Legislature that state agencies
15 may, at their discretion, utilize employee furloughs as a short-term
16 means of addressing budgetary shortfalls. Furlough is defined as placing
17 an employee in a temporary, nonduty, nonpay status because of the lack of
18 funds. An intermittent furlough is a furlough action in which the
19 nonduty, nonpay status occurs discontinuously over a period of time
20 rather than consecutively. It is further intended that furloughs shall
21 not adversely affect the employee and employer health insurance premium
22 contributions and service anniversary date, nor shall leave earnings be
23 prorated as a result of the furlough.
24 Sec. 12. It is the intent of the Legislature that the
25 appropriations for capital facilities follow an orderly and reasonable
26 process based upon defined and documented need and an analysis of the
27 utilization of existing facilities.
28 The biennial appropriations contained in this act covering FY2025-26
29 and FY2026-27, which have been designated for planning, require from the
30 agency a complete program statement prepared in accordance with the
31 Procedural Manual for Capital Construction Projects as approved by the

17 Sec. 13. It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies should
18 construct or renovate facilities in such a manner as to provide the
19 greatest cost-effective energy savings possible. Design criteria
20 emphasizing efficiency, functionality, and energy conservation shall be
21 reflected in program statements, schematic design documents, design
22 development documents, and construction documents. The state building
23 division of the Department of Administrative Services and the Department
24 of Water, Energy, and Environment shall provide technical assistance to

26 efficient new or renovated facilities.
