WHEREAS, on March 29, 2025, the 55th Wing will celebrate its 85th
birthday, we wish to congratulate and thank the men and women of the 55th Wing
for their distinguished service and a legacy of excellence in aviation; and
WHEREAS, the "Fightin' 55th" traces its roots back to its activation by
the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) on November 20, 1940, as the 55th
Pursuit Group (PG) flying P-43/Lancer fighters. The 55 PG evolved into the 55th
Fighter Group (FG) maintaining its fighter escort mission during World War II;
incorporating the 38th, 338th, and 343rd Fighter Squadrons (FS), flying P-38/
Lightning and P-51/Mustang fighters through 1946. On February 24, 1947, the
55th Reconnaissance Group (RG) was activated at McDill Field, Florida,
transitioning the 55th from a fighter to a reconnaissance mission. Now assigned
to the Strategic Air Command (SAC), the 55 RG flew RB-17/Flying Fortress, B-29/
Super Fortress conducting long-range photo reconnaissance missions; and
WHEREAS, as the 55th Wing's critical reconnaissance mission continued to
evolve, so did the Wing. On June 29, 1948, the 55 RG was redesignated as the
55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, The Fightin' 55th has had several unit
designations and numerous stations. It was relocated to its current location at
Offutt Air Force Base (AFB) in Bellevue, Nebraska, on August 16, 1966, while
its redesignation as the 55th Wing did not occur until September 1, 1991; and
WHEREAS, the 55th Wing has historically had numerous subordinate units,
presently the two operational Groups are the 55th Operations Group (55 OG) and
-1-

the 55th Electronic Combat Group (55 ECG). The 55 OG is Air Combat Command's
(ACC) largest Group and has 12 squadrons and two detachments worldwide. It
consists of approximately 3,200 personnel operating 46 aircraft, including 13
models of seven different types. The 55 ECG, located at Davis Monthan AFB,
Arizona, plans and executes information operations including information
warfare and electronic attack in support of theater campaign plans; and
WHEREAS, the 55th Wing has provided critical intelligence to National
Decisionmakers and to friendly forces in combat. Their support has proven
pivotal to the successful execution of all major armed conflicts as far back as
World War II and as recently as the Global War on Terrorism. The 109th
Legislature congratulates the 55th Wing on their 85th birthday and we want to
acknowledge the long lineage of superior service to the United States of
America and the great state of Nebraska.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 3:
1. That the Legislature congratulates the men and women of the 55th Wing
for their distinguished service and legacy of excellence in aviation.

Section 4:
2. That a copy of this resolution be sent to the 55th Wing.
