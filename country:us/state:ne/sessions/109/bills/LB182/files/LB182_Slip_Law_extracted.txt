is amended to read:
77-908 Every insurance company organized under the stock, mutual,
assessment, or reciprocal plan, except fraternal benefit societies, which is
transacting business in this state shall, on or before March 1 of each year,
pay a tax to the director of one percent of the gross amount of direct writing
premiums received by it during the preceding calendar year for business done in
this state, except that (1) for group sickness and accident insurance the rate
of such tax shall be five-tenths of one percent and (2) for property and
casualty insurance, excluding individual sickness and accident insurance, the
rate of such tax shall be one percent. A captive insurer authorized under the
Captive Insurers Act that is transacting business in this state shall, on or
before March 1 of each year, pay to the director a tax of one-fourth of one
percent of the gross amount of direct writing premiums received by such insurer
during the preceding calendar year for business transacted in the state. The
taxable premiums shall include premiums paid on the lives of persons residing
in this state and premiums paid for risks located in this state whether the
insurance was written in this state or not, including that portion of a group
premium paid which represents the premium for insurance on Nebraska residents
or risks located in Nebraska included within the group when the number of lives
in the group exceeds five hundred. The tax shall also apply to premiums
received by domestic companies for insurance written on individuals residing
outside this state or risks located outside this state if no comparable tax is
paid by the direct writing domestic company to any other appropriate taxing
authority. Companies whose scheme of operation contemplates the return of a
portion of premiums to policyholders, without such policyholders being
claimants under the terms of their policies, may deduct such return premiums or
dividends from their gross premiums for the purpose of tax calculations. Any
such insurance company shall receive a credit on the tax imposed as provided in
the Creating High Impact Economic Futures Act, the Nebraska Job Creation and
Mainstreet Revitalization Act, the New Markets Job Growth Investment Act, the
Nebraska Higher Blend Tax Credit Act, the Relocation Incentive Act, the
Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit Act, the Nebraska Shortline Rail

Sec. 3. Section 77-2503, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2503 (1) An owner of an affordable housing project seeking a Nebraska
affordable housing tax credit shall file an application with the authority on a
form prescribed by the authority. An owner shall be allowed a nonrefundable tax
credit if the authority determines that (a) the project for which tax credits
are sought is a qualified project and (b) tax credits are available. A
qualified taxpayer shall be allowed a nonrefundable tax credit if the authority
determines that the project for which tax credits are sought is a qualified
project.
(2) If the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are met, the
authority shall issue an eligibility statement to the owner of such qualified
project stating the amount of Nebraska affordable housing tax credits allocated
to the qualified project. The amount of such tax credits shall be the amount of
federal low-income housing tax credits available to such project, except as
otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section. Tax credits for each
building in a qualified project shall be issued for the first six years of the
credit period as defined in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(1), except that any reduction in
the credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to the
calculation in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(2) shall be allowable in the seventh year of the
credit period. The authority shall only allocate tax credits to qualified
projects that are placed in service after January 1, 2018.
(3) If the owner of the qualified project is a pass-through entity, the
Nebraska affordable housing tax credit shall be allocated among some or all of
the partners, members, or shareholders of the owner of the qualified project.
Any pass-through entity that receives an allocation of the Nebraska affordable
housing tax credit, either from the owner of the qualified project or from
another pass-through entity, may (a) further allocate the tax credit among some
or all of the partners, members, or shareholders, or (b) transfer, sell, or
assign all or a portion of the tax credit to a taxpayer. A pass-through entity
may allocate the tax credit in any manner agreed to by its partners, members,
or shareholders. A partner, member, or shareholder allocated a tax credit must
have been admitted as a partner or member, or have acquired his or her shares,
on or prior to February 15 of the year in which the tax return, or amended
return, claiming the tax credit is filed. A partner, member, or shareholder of
a pass-through entity may transfer, sell, or assign all or part of his or her
ownership interest, including his or her interest in the tax credits authorized
in this section. A taxpayer may transfer, sell, or assign all or a portion of
the tax credit to another taxpayer. A taxpayer must have received a transfer or
assignment of a tax credit prior to the date a tax return, or amended return,
claiming the tax credit is filed. For any tax year in which a credit is
allocated, transferred, sold, or assigned pursuant to this subsection, the
pass-through entity allocating the tax credit, or taxpayer transferring,
selling, or assigning the tax credit, as applicable, shall notify the
Department of Revenue of the allocation, transfer, sale, or assignment and
provide the tax identification number of the allocatee or transferee at least
thirty days prior to the taxpayer claiming the tax credit. The notification
shall be in the manner prescribed by the department.
(3) If the owner of the qualified project is (a) a partnership, (b) a
limited liability company, or (c) a corporation having an election in effect
under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the
Nebraska affordable housing tax credit shall be allocated among some or all of
the partners, members, or shareholders of the owner of the qualified project in
any manner agreed to by such persons, but only if such persons have been
admitted as partners or members, or have acquired their shares, on or prior to
February 15 of the year in which the tax return, or amended return, claiming
the tax credit is filed. A qualified taxpayer may transfer, sell, or assign all
or part of his or her ownership interest, including his or her interest in the
tax credits authorized in this section. For any tax year in which such an
interest is transferred, sold, or assigned pursuant to this subsection, the
transferor shall notify the Department of Revenue of the transfer, sale, or
assignment and provide the tax identification number of the new owner at least
thirty days prior to the new owner claiming the tax credits. The notification
shall be in the manner prescribed by the department.
(4) The maximum amount of Nebraska affordable housing tax credits awarded
to all qualified projects in any given allocation year shall be no more than
one hundred percent of the total amount of federal low-income housing tax
credits awarded by the authority in the same allocation year. Notwithstanding
any other provision of the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Act, the authority is
prohibited from awarding to a qualified project any combined amount of federal
low-income housing tax credits and Nebraska affordable housing tax credits that
is more than necessary to make the qualified project financially feasible.
(5) Any Nebraska affordable housing tax credits granted under this section
may be used to offset any income taxes due under section 77-2715 or 77-2734.02,
any premium and related retaliatory taxes due under section 44-150, 77-908, or
81-523, or any franchise taxes due under sections 77-3801 to 77-3807.
(6) The tax credit shall not be used to reduce the tax liability of the
qualified taxpayer to less than zero. Any tax credit claimed but not used in a
taxable year may be carried forward.
Sec. 4. Section 77-2506, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
77-2506 If a portion of any federal low-income housing tax credits taken
-2-

on a qualified project is required to be recaptured or is otherwise disallowed
under 26 U.S.C. 42 during the 6-year period described in subsection (2) of

Section 4:
section 77-2503, a portion of the Nebraska affordable housing tax credits with
respect to such project shall also be recaptured from the qualified taxpayer
who claimed such credits. The percentage of Nebraska affordable housing tax
credits subject to recapture under this section shall be equal to the
percentage of federal low-income housing tax credits subject to recapture or
otherwise disallowed during such period. Any Nebraska affordable housing tax
credits recaptured or disallowed under this section shall increase the tax
liability of the qualified taxpayer who claimed the credits in the year the
Department of Revenue declares the tax credits to be disallowed or recaptured.

amended to read:

end of the taxable year. No extension of time to pay the tax shall be granted.
If the Tax Commissioner determines that the amount of tax can be computed from
available information filed by the financial institutions with either state or
federal regulatory agencies, the Tax Commissioner may, by regulation, waive the
requirement for the financial institutions to file returns.
(2) Sections 77-2714 to 77-27,135 relating to deficiencies, penalties,
interest, the collection of delinquent amounts, and appeal procedures for the
tax imposed by section 77-2734.02 shall also apply to the tax imposed by

Section 5:
section 77-3802. If the filing of a return is waived by the Tax Commissioner,
the payment of the tax shall be considered the filing of a return for purposes
of sections 77-2714 to 77-27,135.
(3) No refund of the tax imposed by section 77-3802 shall be allowed
unless a claim for such refund is filed within ninety days of the date on which
(a) the tax is due or was paid, whichever is later, (b) a change is made to the
amount of deposits or the net financial income of the financial institution by
a state or federal regulatory agency, or (c) the Nebraska Investment Finance

LEGISLATIVE BILL 182
Approved by the Governor February 25, 2025
Introduced by Bostar, 29; Hallstrom, 1.
A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to revenue and taxation; to amend sections 77-2506
and 81-523, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and sections 77-908,
77-2502, 77-2503, 77-2508, 77-3806, 77-7202, and 77-7204, Revised Statutes
Cumulative Supplement, 2024; to define, redefine, and eliminate terms and
change provisions relating to the allocation, transfer, sale, and
assignment of tax credits under the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Act; to
authorize additional uses of the tax credits granted under the Child Care
Tax Credit Act; to harmonize provisions; and to repeal the original
sections.
Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Section 77-908, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
77-908 Every insurance company organized under the stock, mutual,
assessment, or reciprocal plan, except fraternal benefit societies, which is
transacting business in this state shall, on or before March 1 of each year,
pay a tax to the director of one percent of the gross amount of direct writing
premiums received by it during the preceding calendar year for business done in
this state, except that (1) for group sickness and accident insurance the rate
of such tax shall be five-tenths of one percent and (2) for property and
casualty insurance, excluding individual sickness and accident insurance, the
rate of such tax shall be one percent. A captive insurer authorized under the
Captive Insurers Act that is transacting business in this state shall, on or
before March 1 of each year, pay to the director a tax of one-fourth of one
percent of the gross amount of direct writing premiums received by such insurer
during the preceding calendar year for business transacted in the state. The
taxable premiums shall include premiums paid on the lives of persons residing
in this state and premiums paid for risks located in this state whether the
insurance was written in this state or not, including that portion of a group
premium paid which represents the premium for insurance on Nebraska residents
or risks located in Nebraska included within the group when the number of lives
in the group exceeds five hundred. The tax shall also apply to premiums
received by domestic companies for insurance written on individuals residing
outside this state or risks located outside this state if no comparable tax is
paid by the direct writing domestic company to any other appropriate taxing
authority. Companies whose scheme of operation contemplates the return of a
portion of premiums to policyholders, without such policyholders being
claimants under the terms of their policies, may deduct such return premiums or
dividends from their gross premiums for the purpose of tax calculations. Any
such insurance company shall receive a credit on the tax imposed as provided in
the Creating High Impact Economic Futures Act, the Nebraska Job Creation and
Mainstreet Revitalization Act, the New Markets Job Growth Investment Act, the
Nebraska Higher Blend Tax Credit Act, the Relocation Incentive Act, the
Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit Act, the Nebraska Shortline Rail
Modernization Act, the Child Care Tax Credit Act, and the Affordable Housing
Tax Credit Act.

Sec. 3. Section 77-2503, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2503 (1) An owner of an affordable housing project seeking a Nebraska
affordable housing tax credit shall file an application with the authority on a
form prescribed by the authority. An owner shall be allowed a nonrefundable tax
credit if the authority determines that (a) the project for which tax credits
are sought is a qualified project and (b) tax credits are available. A
qualified taxpayer shall be allowed a nonrefundable tax credit if the authority
determines that the project for which tax credits are sought is a qualified
project.
(2) If the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are met, the
authority shall issue an eligibility statement to the owner of such qualified
project stating the amount of Nebraska affordable housing tax credits allocated
to the qualified project. The amount of such tax credits shall be the amount of
federal low-income housing tax credits available to such project, except as
otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section. Tax credits for each
building in a qualified project shall be issued for the first six years of the
credit period as defined in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(1), except that any reduction in
the credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to the
calculation in 26 U.S.C. 42(f)(2) shall be allowable in the seventh year of the
credit period. The authority shall only allocate tax credits to qualified
projects that are placed in service after January 1, 2018.
(3) If the owner of the qualified project is a pass-through entity, the
Nebraska affordable housing tax credit shall be allocated among some or all of
the partners, members, or shareholders of the owner of the qualified project.
Any pass-through entity that receives an allocation of the Nebraska affordable
housing tax credit, either from the owner of the qualified project or from
another pass-through entity, may (a) further allocate the tax credit among some
or all of the partners, members, or shareholders, or (b) transfer, sell, or
assign all or a portion of the tax credit to a taxpayer. A pass-through entity
may allocate the tax credit in any manner agreed to by its partners, members,
or shareholders. A partner, member, or shareholder allocated a tax credit must
have been admitted as a partner or member, or have acquired his or her shares,
on or prior to February 15 of the year in which the tax return, or amended
return, claiming the tax credit is filed. A partner, member, or shareholder of
a pass-through entity may transfer, sell, or assign all or part of his or her
ownership interest, including his or her interest in the tax credits authorized
in this section. A taxpayer may transfer, sell, or assign all or a portion of
the tax credit to another taxpayer. A taxpayer must have received a transfer or
assignment of a tax credit prior to the date a tax return, or amended return,
claiming the tax credit is filed. For any tax year in which a credit is
allocated, transferred, sold, or assigned pursuant to this subsection, the
pass-through entity allocating the tax credit, or taxpayer transferring,
selling, or assigning the tax credit, as applicable, shall notify the
Department of Revenue of the allocation, transfer, sale, or assignment and
provide the tax identification number of the allocatee or transferee at least
thirty days prior to the taxpayer claiming the tax credit. The notification
shall be in the manner prescribed by the department.
(3) If the owner of the qualified project is (a) a partnership, (b) a
limited liability company, or (c) a corporation having an election in effect
under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the
Nebraska affordable housing tax credit shall be allocated among some or all of
the partners, members, or shareholders of the owner of the qualified project in
any manner agreed to by such persons, but only if such persons have been
admitted as partners or members, or have acquired their shares, on or prior to
February 15 of the year in which the tax return, or amended return, claiming
the tax credit is filed. A qualified taxpayer may transfer, sell, or assign all
or part of his or her ownership interest, including his or her interest in the
tax credits authorized in this section. For any tax year in which such an
interest is transferred, sold, or assigned pursuant to this subsection, the
transferor shall notify the Department of Revenue of the transfer, sale, or
assignment and provide the tax identification number of the new owner at least
thirty days prior to the new owner claiming the tax credits. The notification
shall be in the manner prescribed by the department.
(4) The maximum amount of Nebraska affordable housing tax credits awarded
to all qualified projects in any given allocation year shall be no more than
one hundred percent of the total amount of federal low-income housing tax
credits awarded by the authority in the same allocation year. Notwithstanding
any other provision of the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Act, the authority is
prohibited from awarding to a qualified project any combined amount of federal
low-income housing tax credits and Nebraska affordable housing tax credits that
is more than necessary to make the qualified project financially feasible.
(5) Any Nebraska affordable housing tax credits granted under this section
may be used to offset any income taxes due under section 77-2715 or 77-2734.02,
any premium and related retaliatory taxes due under section 44-150, 77-908, or
81-523, or any franchise taxes due under sections 77-3801 to 77-3807.
(6) The tax credit shall not be used to reduce the tax liability of the
qualified taxpayer to less than zero. Any tax credit claimed but not used in a
taxable year may be carried forward.
Sec. 4. Section 77-2506, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended

under 26 U.S.C. 42 during the 6-year period described in subsection (2) of
section 77-2503, a portion of the Nebraska affordable housing tax credits with
respect to such project shall also be recaptured from the qualified taxpayer
who claimed such credits. The percentage of Nebraska affordable housing tax
credits subject to recapture under this section shall be equal to the
percentage of federal low-income housing tax credits subject to recapture or
otherwise disallowed during such period. Any Nebraska affordable housing tax
credits recaptured or disallowed under this section shall increase the tax
liability of the qualified taxpayer who claimed the credits in the year the
Department of Revenue declares the tax credits to be disallowed or recaptured.

of sections 77-2714 to 77-27,135.

unless a claim for such refund is filed within ninety days of the date on which

amount of deposits or the net financial income of the financial institution by
a state or federal regulatory agency, or (c) the Nebraska Investment Finance
