examine the impact of the "cliff effect" on Nebraska families receiving public
assistance. The cliff effect occurs when an increase in income such as
accepting a raise, promotion, or additional work hours results in a
disproportionate loss of public assistance, such as aid to dependent children,
medicaid, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This effect often
deters individuals from advancing in their careers or increasing earnings. The
study will analyze how the cliff effect impacts workforce participation and
long-term economic self-sufficiency and will identify potential strategies or
reforms to address such cliffs in a way that encourages upward mobility without
immediate loss of public assistance.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Health and Human Services Committee of the Legislature shall
be designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this
resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
