WHEREAS, Second Chance Month has been observed in April in the United
States since 2017 in an effort to raise awareness of the collateral
consequences of criminal, especially felony, convictions and to seek solutions;
and
WHEREAS, each year, more than six hundred thousand individuals are
released from state and federal prisons across the United States, including
over four thousand returning to communities in Nebraska; and
WHEREAS, Second Chance Month is a time to recognize the importance of
second chances and to support the safe and successful reentry of formerly
incarcerated individuals; and
WHEREAS, individuals that are system impacted often face significant
barriers to housing, employment, and education; and
WHEREAS, removing barriers and supporting reentry efforts through a
commitment to second chance opportunities and social support not only
strengthens families and communities, but also improves public safety, reduces
recidivism, contributes to a stronger economy, and ensures that Nebraska
remains a land of opportunity for all people; and
WHEREAS, Second Chance Month is an opportunity to affirm the dignity and
potential of every person.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Legislature recognizes April 2025 as Second Chance Month in
Nebraska.
