E AND R AMENDMENTS TO LB 150
1 1. Strike the original sections and all amendments thereto and
2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
6 (1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current
7 mental health system, including a shortage of mental health care
8 professionals and long travel distances to receive care. These issues
9 have had a negative impact on those suffering from mental health issues
10 and their communities, particularly in rural parts of the state;
11 (2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
12 crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to
13 respond and take the individual into emergency protective custody until
14 the individual can be transported to an available mental health treatment
15 facility. This places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies,
16 particularly in rural parts of the state, which is compounded by the
17 shortage of mental health bed space and long travel distances to
18 facilities;
19 (3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and
20 the state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the
21 negative impact of mental health issues on individuals and law
22 enforcement agencies;
23 (4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
24 communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
25 efficiently and cost-effectively; and
26 (5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of
27 cooperation and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those
-1-

LB150 LB150
MJP - 05/22/2025 MJP - 05/22/2025
1 suffering from mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that
2 interact with them.
3 Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
4 Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
5 provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental
6 health beds and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to
7 service the region.
8 (2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate
9 a method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to
10 address the impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those
11 suffering from mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that
12 can be replicated statewide.
13 (3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency
14 for the pilot program. The selected agency shall:
15 (a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an
16 existing jail facility or elsewhere;
17 (b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement
18 agencies;
19 (c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
20 additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues
21 and law enforcement agencies; and
22 (d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies
23 through a memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds
24 provide a regional benefit.
25 (4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health
26 Expansion Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result
27 in the incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing
28 in the act should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is
29 to expand mental health services provided by law enforcement agencies to
30 individuals temporarily in custody for mental health issues.
31 Sec. 4. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal

1 Justice shall administer the pilot program and, in addition to the
2 requirements set out in section 3 of this act, develop grant eligibility,
3 application, and audit requirements.
4 (2) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
5 carry out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
6 (3) The commission shall identify grant funding to carry out the
7 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
8 Sec. 5. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
9 Justice shall coordinate with the Attorney General to carry out the
10 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
11 Sec. 6. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
12 Justice shall create a pilot program to seek federal funding for
13 collaborative efforts in emergency response by law enforcement agencies
14 and mental health professionals.
15 Sec. 7. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
18 villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define,
19 regulate, suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race,
20 color, creed, religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin,
21 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in
22 section 20-308.01, or age, or military or veteran status in employment,
23 public accommodation, and housing and may provide for the enforcement of
24 such ordinances by providing appropriate penalties for the violation
25 thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment practice to refuse
26 employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses if such policy
27 is equally applied to both sexes.
28 Sec. 8. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county
31 may adopt resolutions which are substantially equivalent to the Age

MJP - 05/22/2025 MJP - 05/22/2025
1 Discrimination in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice
2 Act, the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and
3 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
4 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
5 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
6 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to
7 those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or resolution may
8 include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages or other
9 equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a petition
10 in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
11 local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
12 equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission
13 or other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and
14 shall have authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to
15 enforce such orders or relief in the district court with appropriate
16 jurisdiction. Certified copies of such ordinances or resolutions shall be
17 transmitted to the commission. When the commission determines that any
18 such city or county has enacted an ordinance or adopted a resolution that
19 is substantially equivalent to such acts and sections or is more
20 comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
21 rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance or
22 resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
23 such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints
24 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
25 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
26 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
27 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
28 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
29 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
30 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
31 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties
-4-

LB150 LB150
MJP - 05/22/2025 MJP - 05/22/2025
1 or the interests of justice require such action, the commission may
2 regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in the same
3 manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies. In
4 cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
5 subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.
6 (2)(a) Any club which has been issued a license by the Nebraska
7 Liquor Control Commission to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic liquor
8 shall have that license revoked if the club discriminates because of
9 race, color, religion, sex, familial status as defined in section 20-311,
10 disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or national origin, or
11 military or veteran status in the sale, serving, or dispensing of
12 alcoholic liquor to any person who is a guest of a member of such club.
13 (b) The procedure for revocation shall be as prescribed in sections
14 53-134.04, 53-1,115, and 53-1,116.
15 (c) This subsection does not prohibit a club from, on an otherwise
16 nondiscriminatory basis, limiting admission or service to veterans or
17 servicemembers or their family members or providing discounts or other
18 benefits to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.
19 Sec. 9. Section 20-132, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:
21 20-132 All persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and
22 equal enjoyment of any place of public accommodation, as defined in
23 sections 20-132 to 20-143, without discrimination or segregation on the
24 grounds of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, or
25 ancestry, or military or veteran status.
26 Sec. 10. Section 20-134, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
27 amended to read:
28 20-134 (1) Any person who directly or indirectly refuses, withholds
29 from, denies, or attempts to refuse, withhold, or deny, to any other

2 origin, disability, or ancestry, or military or veteran status, shall be
3 guilty of discriminatory practice and shall be subject to the penalties
4 of sections 20-132 to 20-143.
5 (2) It is not a discriminatory practice under sections 20-132 to
6 20-143 for a person or a place of public accommodation to, on an
7 otherwise nondiscriminatory basis, limit admission or service to veterans
8 or servicemembers or their family members or provide discounts or other

20 county attorney, the commission shall be notified. Powers granted to and
21 duties imposed upon the commission pursuant to such act and sections

1 state. Such standard temporary ex parte and final sexual assault
2 protection order forms shall be the only forms used in this state.
3 (7) A sexual assault protection order may be issued or renewed ex
4 parte without notice to the respondent if it reasonably appears from the
5 specific facts shown by affidavit of the petitioner that irreparable
6 harm, loss, or damage will result before the matter can be heard on
7 notice. If a sexual assault protection order is not issued ex parte, the
8 court shall immediately schedule an evidentiary hearing to be held within
9 fourteen days after the filing of the petition, and the court shall cause
10 notice of the application to be given to the respondent stating that he
11 or she may show cause why such order should not be entered. Any notice
12 provided to the respondent shall include notification that a court may
13 treat a petition for a sexual assault protection order as a petition for
14 a harassment protection order or a domestic abuse protection order if it
15 appears from the facts that such other protection order is more
16 appropriate and that the respondent shall have an opportunity to show
17 cause as to why such protection order should not be entered. If such ex

27 return it to the clerk of the district court within ten business days
28 after service upon him or her. Upon receipt of a timely request for a

2 been offered into evidence at any show-cause hearing. The petition and
3 affidavit shall be admitted into evidence unless specifically excluded by
4 the court.
5 (8) A court may treat a petition for a sexual assault protection
6 order as a petition for a harassment protection order or a domestic abuse
7 protection order if it appears from the facts in the petition, affidavit,
8 and evidence presented at a show-cause hearing that such other protection
9 order is more appropriate and if:
10 (a) The court makes specific findings that such other order is more
11 appropriate; or
12 (b) The petitioner has requested the court to so treat the petition.
13 (9)(a) Upon the issuance or renewal of any temporary ex parte or

15 forthwith provide the petitioner, without charge, with two certified
16 copies of such order. The clerk of the court shall also forthwith provide
17 the local police department or local law enforcement agency and the local

20 shall also forthwith provide a copy of the sexual assault protection
21 order to the sheriff's office in the county where the respondent may be
22 personally served together with instructions for service. Upon receipt of
23 the order and instructions for service, such sheriff's office shall
24 forthwith serve the sexual assault protection order upon the respondent
25 and file its return thereon with the clerk of the court which issued the
26 sexual assault protection order within fourteen days of the issuance of
27 the initial or renewed sexual assault protection order. If any sexual
28 assault protection order is dismissed or modified by the court, the clerk
29 of the court shall forthwith provide the local police department or local
30 law enforcement agency and the local sheriff's office, without charge,
31 with one copy each of the order of dismissal or modification.

24 protection order recognized pursuant to section 28-311.12 and (b) a
25 petitioner under this section provides the peace officer with a copy of

3 47-1102 (1) The Legislature finds that studies have shown that post-
4 prison outcomes tend to be better for committed offenders who participate
5 in work release programs prior to discharge from custody. Specifically,
6 findings indicate that committed offenders who participated in work
7 release programs had a higher likelihood of obtaining post-release
8 employment within the first calendar quarter after release and also had a
9 significantly lower rate of recidivism than committed offenders who did
10 not participate in work release programs prior to discharge from custody.
11 In addition, studies indicate that committed offenders who participated
12 in privately operated work release programs were significantly more
13 likely to become employed after release.
14 (2) In light of these findings, and in order to give the Board of
15 Parole and the Department of Correctional Services additional options for
16 the placement of committed offenders, it is the intent of the
17 Legislature:
18 (a) To increase the number of committed offenders in the Nebraska
19 correctional system who are exposed to work release prior to discharge
20 from custody; and
21 (b) To do so in settings that also offer therapy, programming,
22 treatment, vocational training, and educational classes.
23 (3) To achieve these goals, the purpose of the Community Work
24 Release and Reentry Centers Act is to empower the Division of Parole
25 Supervision and the Department of Correctional Services to contract with
26 private providers to establish community work release and reentry centers
27 at various locations throughout the State of Nebraska.

1 respondent, in addition to the commission, may introduce witnesses at the

4 without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by either
5 party. All evidence shall be under oath and a record thereof shall be
6 made and preserved. Such proceedings shall, so far as practicable, be
7 conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the
8 district courts of the State of Nebraska, and shall be of public record.
9 (2) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any
10 book, document, paper, or account in any investigation, or inquiry by, or
11 hearing before the commission when ordered to do so, upon the ground that
12 the testimony or evidence, book, document, paper, or account required of

25 Constitution of the United States.
26 (3) After the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall,
27 within ten days of the receipt of the transcript or the receipt of the
28 recommendations from the hearing officer, make and file its findings of
29 fact and conclusions of law and make and enter an appropriate order. The

1 findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be in sufficient detail to
2 enable a court on appeal to determine the controverted questions
3 presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight was given to the
4 evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
5 intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
6 employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such
7 respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from
8 such unlawful employment practice and order such other affirmative action
9 as may be appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to,
10 reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay
11 liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the
12 filing of the charge with the commission. Interim earnings or amounts
13 earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated
14 against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.

16 harm as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any
17 stage of the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in
18 the district court of the county where such alleged violation occurred.
19 If the complainant files a district court action on the charge, the
20 complainant shall provide written notice of such filing to the
21 commission, and such notification shall immediately terminate all
22 proceedings before the commission. The district court shall file and try
23 such case as any other civil action, and any successful complainant shall
24 be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or permanent
25 injunctive relief, general and special damages, reasonable attorney's
26 fees, and costs.
27 (5) No order of the commission shall require the admission or
28 reinstatement of an individual as a member of a labor organization or the
29 hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or
30 the payment to him or her of any backpay, if such individual was refused
31 admission, suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or

5 has not engaged in any unfair employment practice, it shall within thirty
6 days state its findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of any
7 order shall be served upon the person against whom it runs or his or her
8 attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to the
9 proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take effect twenty days
10 after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall continue in
11 force either for a period which may be designated therein or until
12 changed or revoked by the commission.

14 transcript of the record of the proceedings is filed in the district
15 court as provided in section 48-1120, the commission may, at any time

1 (3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming
2 fee in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that

22 parolee is financially unable to make the payment.
23 (6) If the board determines that the default in payment described in

25 refusal to obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's
26 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
27 payment, the board may allow the parolee additional time for payment,
28 reduce the amount of each installment, or revoke the fees or the unpaid
29 portion in whole or in part.

17 and custodial sanctions for use in responding to and deterring substance
18 abuse violations and technical violations. A custodial sanction of thirty
19 days in a correctional facility or a contract facility shall be
20 designated as the most severe response to a violation in lieu of
21 revocation.
22 (3) Whenever a parole officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
23 parolee has committed or is about to commit a substance abuse violation
24 or technical violation while on parole, but that the parolee will not
25 attempt to leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in
26 danger, the parole officer shall either:

4 submitted to the Board of Parole; or
5 (b) Submit a written report to the Board of Parole, outlining the
6 nature of the parole violation, and request the imposition of a custodial
7 sanction of up to thirty days in a correctional facility or a contract
8 facility. On the basis of the report and such further investigation as
9 the board may deem appropriate, the board shall determine whether and how
10 the parolee violated the conditions of parole and may:
11 (i) Dismiss the charge of violation; or

14 thirty days in a correctional facility or a contract facility.
15 (4) Whenever a parole officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
16 parolee has violated or is about to violate a condition of parole by a
17 violation other than a substance abuse violation or a technical violation
18 and the parole officer has reasonable cause to believe that the parolee
19 will not attempt to leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or
20 property in danger, the parole officer shall submit a written report to
21 the Board of Parole which may, on the basis of such report and such
22 further investigation as it may deem appropriate:
23 (a) Dismiss the charge of violation;
24 (b) Determine whether the parolee violated the conditions of his or
25 her parole;
26 (c) Impose a custodial sanction of up to thirty days in a

ER90 ER90
LB150 LB150
MJP - 05/22/2025 MJP - 05/22/2025
1 parolee has violated or is about to violate a condition of parole and
2 that the parolee will attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place
3 lives or property in danger, the parole officer shall arrest the parolee
4 without a warrant and call on any peace officer to assist him or her in
5 doing so.
6 (6) Whenever a parolee is arrested with or without a warrant, he or
7 she shall be detained in a local jail or other detention facility
8 operated by the department Department of Correctional Services pending
9 completion of review of parole proceedings by the Board of Parole.
10 Immediately after such arrest and detention, the parole officer shall
11 notify the Board of Parole and submit a written report of the reason for
12 such arrest. A complete investigation shall be made by the department
13 Division of Parole Supervision and submitted to the board. After prompt
14 consideration of such written report, the board shall order the parolee's
15 release from detention or continued confinement to await a final decision
16 on imposition of a custodial sanction or the revocation of parole.
17 (7) The Board of Parole shall adopt and promulgate rules and

25 offender is held, the time of parole eligibility, any decision of the
26 board relating to the offender, and the nature of the offender's
27 adjustment during imprisonment and shall give reasonable notice to such
28 authority of the offender's release date.
29 (3) The board may parole an offender who is eligible for release to
30 a warrant or detainer. If an offender is paroled to such a warrant or
31 detainer, the board may provide, as a condition of release, that if the

LB150 LB150
MJP - 05/22/2025 MJP - 05/22/2025

3 expiration of the offender's parole term, the authority to whose warrant
4 or detainer the offender is released shall return the offender to serve
5 the remainder of the parole term or such part as the board may determine.
6 (4) If a person paroled to a warrant or detainer is thereafter
7 sentenced and placed on probation, or released on parole in another
8 jurisdiction, prior to the expiration of the parole term less good time
9 in this state, the board may permit the person to serve the remainder of
10 the parole term or such part as the board may determine concurrently with
11 the person's new probation or parole term. Such concurrent terms may be
12 served in either of the two jurisdictions, and supervision shall be
13 administered in accordance with the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender

25 the committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
26 (b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
27 correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in
28 the facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a
29 law-abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed
30 offender would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on
31 institutional discipline; or
-187-

E AND R AMENDMENTS TO LB 150
Introduced by Guereca, 7, Chairman Enrollment and Review
1 1. Strike the original sections and all amendments thereto and
2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
6 (1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current
7 mental health system, including a shortage of mental health care
8 professionals and long travel distances to receive care. These issues
9 have had a negative impact on those suffering from mental health issues
10 and their communities, particularly in rural parts of the state;
11 (2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
12 crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to
13 respond and take the individual into emergency protective custody until
14 the individual can be transported to an available mental health treatment
15 facility. This places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies,
16 particularly in rural parts of the state, which is compounded by the
17 shortage of mental health bed space and long travel distances to
18 facilities;
19 (3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and
20 the state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the
21 negative impact of mental health issues on individuals and law
22 enforcement agencies;
23 (4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
24 communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
25 efficiently and cost-effectively; and
26 (5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of
27 cooperation and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those

1 suffering from mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that
2 interact with them.
3 Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
4 Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
5 provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental
6 health beds and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to
7 service the region.
8 (2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate
9 a method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to
10 address the impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those
11 suffering from mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that
12 can be replicated statewide.
13 (3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency
14 for the pilot program. The selected agency shall:
15 (a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an
16 existing jail facility or elsewhere;

3 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
4 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
5 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
6 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to

24 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
25 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
26 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
27 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
28 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
29 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
30 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
31 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties

3 (7) A sexual assault protection order may be issued or renewed ex
4 parte without notice to the respondent if it reasonably appears from the

7 notice. If a sexual assault protection order is not issued ex parte, the
8 court shall immediately schedule an evidentiary hearing to be held within
9 fourteen days after the filing of the petition, and the court shall cause
10 notice of the application to be given to the respondent stating that he
11 or she may show cause why such order should not be entered. Any notice
12 provided to the respondent shall include notification that a court may
13 treat a petition for a sexual assault protection order as a petition for
14 a harassment protection order or a domestic abuse protection order if it
15 appears from the facts that such other protection order is more

28 after service upon him or her. Upon receipt of a timely request for a

3 affidavit shall be admitted into evidence unless specifically excluded by
4 the court.
5 (8) A court may treat a petition for a sexual assault protection
6 order as a petition for a harassment protection order or a domestic abuse
7 protection order if it appears from the facts in the petition, affidavit,
8 and evidence presented at a show-cause hearing that such other protection
9 order is more appropriate and if:
10 (a) The court makes specific findings that such other order is more
11 appropriate; or
12 (b) The petitioner has requested the court to so treat the petition.
13 (9)(a) Upon the issuance or renewal of any temporary ex parte or

21 order to the sheriff's office in the county where the respondent may be
22 personally served together with instructions for service. Upon receipt of
23 the order and instructions for service, such sheriff's office shall
24 forthwith serve the sexual assault protection order upon the respondent
25 and file its return thereon with the clerk of the court which issued the
26 sexual assault protection order within fourteen days of the issuance of
27 the initial or renewed sexual assault protection order. If any sexual
28 assault protection order is dismissed or modified by the court, the clerk
29 of the court shall forthwith provide the local police department or local
30 law enforcement agency and the local sheriff's office, without charge,
31 with one copy each of the order of dismissal or modification.

3 47-1102 (1) The Legislature finds that studies have shown that post-
4 prison outcomes tend to be better for committed offenders who participate
5 in work release programs prior to discharge from custody. Specifically,
6 findings indicate that committed offenders who participated in work
7 release programs had a higher likelihood of obtaining post-release
8 employment within the first calendar quarter after release and also had a
9 significantly lower rate of recidivism than committed offenders who did
10 not participate in work release programs prior to discharge from custody.
11 In addition, studies indicate that committed offenders who participated
12 in privately operated work release programs were significantly more
13 likely to become employed after release.
14 (2) In light of these findings, and in order to give the Board of
15 Parole and the Department of Correctional Services additional options for

26 private providers to establish community work release and reentry centers
27 at various locations throughout the State of Nebraska.

4 without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by either
5 party. All evidence shall be under oath and a record thereof shall be
6 made and preserved. Such proceedings shall, so far as practicable, be
7 conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the
8 district courts of the State of Nebraska, and shall be of public record.
9 (2) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any
10 book, document, paper, or account in any investigation, or inquiry by, or
11 hearing before the commission when ordered to do so, upon the ground that
12 the testimony or evidence, book, document, paper, or account required of

25 Constitution of the United States.
26 (3) After the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall,
27 within ten days of the receipt of the transcript or the receipt of the
28 recommendations from the hearing officer, make and file its findings of
29 fact and conclusions of law and make and enter an appropriate order. The

2 enable a court on appeal to determine the controverted questions
3 presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight was given to the
4 evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
5 intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
6 employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such
7 respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from
8 such unlawful employment practice and order such other affirmative action
9 as may be appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to,
10 reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay
11 liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the
12 filing of the charge with the commission. Interim earnings or amounts
13 earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated
14 against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.

16 harm as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any
17 stage of the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in
18 the district court of the county where such alleged violation occurred.
19 If the complainant files a district court action on the charge, the
20 complainant shall provide written notice of such filing to the
21 commission, and such notification shall immediately terminate all
22 proceedings before the commission. The district court shall file and try
23 such case as any other civil action, and any successful complainant shall
24 be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or permanent
25 injunctive relief, general and special damages, reasonable attorney's
26 fees, and costs.
27 (5) No order of the commission shall require the admission or
28 reinstatement of an individual as a member of a labor organization or the
29 hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or
30 the payment to him or her of any backpay, if such individual was refused
31 admission, suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or

5 has not engaged in any unfair employment practice, it shall within thirty
6 days state its findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of any
7 order shall be served upon the person against whom it runs or his or her
8 attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to the
9 proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take effect twenty days
10 after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall continue in

1 (3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming
2 fee in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that

22 parolee is financially unable to make the payment.
23 (6) If the board determines that the default in payment described in

25 refusal to obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's
26 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
27 payment, the board may allow the parolee additional time for payment,
28 reduce the amount of each installment, or revoke the fees or the unpaid
29 portion in whole or in part.
30 (7) No parolee shall be required to pay more than one monthly parole
31 programming fee per month.

25 offender is held, the time of parole eligibility, any decision of the
26 board relating to the offender, and the nature of the offender's
27 adjustment during imprisonment and shall give reasonable notice to such
28 authority of the offender's release date.

20 consideration of committed offenders eligible for parole while the
21 correctional system overcrowding emergency is in effect, the board shall
22 order the release of each committed offender unless it is of the opinion
23 that such release should be deferred because:
24 (a) The board has determined that it is more likely than not that
25 the committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
26 (b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
27 correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in
28 the facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a
29 law-abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed
30 offender would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on
31 institutional discipline; or
-187-

ER90 ER90

MJP - 05/22/2025 MJP - 05/22/2025
1 (c) The board has determined that there is a very substantial risk
2 that the committed offender will commit a violent act against a person.
3 (4) In making the determination regarding the risk that a committed
4 offender will not conform to the conditions of parole, the board shall
5 take into account the factors set forth in subsection (2) of section
6 83-1,114 and shall comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of
7 section 83-1,114 and section 83-196.01.
8 (5) The board shall continue granting parole to offenders under this
9 section until the director certifies that the population is at
