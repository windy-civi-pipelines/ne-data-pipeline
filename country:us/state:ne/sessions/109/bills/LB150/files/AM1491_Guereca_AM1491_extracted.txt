4 18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
5 villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define,
6 regulate, suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race,
7 color, creed, religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin,
8 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in
9 section 20-308.01, or age, or military or veteran status in employment,
10 public accommodation, and housing and may provide for the enforcement of
11 such ordinances by providing appropriate penalties for the violation
12 thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment practice to refuse
13 employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses if such policy
14 is equally applied to both sexes.
15 Sec. 8. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county

20 Act, the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and
21 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
22 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
23 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
24 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to
25 those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or resolution may

AJC - 05/15/2025 AJC - 05/15/2025
1 equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a petition
2 in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
3 local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
4 equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission
5 or other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and
6 shall have authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to
7 enforce such orders or relief in the district court with appropriate
8 jurisdiction. Certified copies of such ordinances or resolutions shall be
9 transmitted to the commission. When the commission determines that any
10 such city or county has enacted an ordinance or adopted a resolution that
11 is substantially equivalent to such acts and sections or is more
12 comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
13 rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance or
14 resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
15 such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints
16 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
17 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
18 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
19 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
20 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
21 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
22 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
23 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties
24 or the interests of justice require such action, the commission may
25 regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in the same
26 manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies. In
27 cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
28 subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.

6 hearing officer need not refer to the page and line numbers of the

8 findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be in sufficient detail to
9 enable a court on appeal to determine the controverted questions
10 presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight was given to the
11 evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
12 intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
13 employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such
14 respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from
15 such unlawful employment practice and order such other affirmative action
16 as may be appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to,
17 reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay
18 liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the
19 filing of the charge with the commission. Interim earnings or amounts
20 earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated
21 against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.

23 harm as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any
24 stage of the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in
25 the district court of the county where such alleged violation occurred.
26 If the complainant files a district court action on the charge, the
27 complainant shall provide written notice of such filing to the
28 commission, and such notification shall immediately terminate all
29 proceedings before the commission. The district court shall file and try
30 such case as any other civil action, and any successful complainant shall
31 be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or permanent

6 the payment to him or her of any backpay, if such individual was refused
7 admission, suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or
8 advancement or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than
9 discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, disability,
10 marital status, or national origin, or military or veteran status or in
11 violation of section 48-1114. If the commission finds that a respondent
12 has not engaged in any unfair employment practice, it shall within thirty
13 days state its findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of any
14 order shall be served upon the person against whom it runs or his or her
15 attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to the
16 proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take effect twenty days
17 after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall continue in
18 force either for a period which may be designated therein or until
19 changed or revoked by the commission.
20 (6) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, until a
21 transcript of the record of the proceedings is filed in the district
22 court as provided in section 48-1120, the commission may, at any time
23 upon reasonable notice and in such a manner it shall deem proper, modify

AJC - 05/15/2025 AJC - 05/15/2025
AMENDMENTS TO LB150
(Amendments to Standing Committee amendments, AM1370)
Introduced by Guereca, 7.
1 1. Insert the following new sections:
2 Sec. 7. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
5 villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define,
6 regulate, suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race,
7 color, creed, religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin,
8 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in
9 section 20-308.01, or age, or military or veteran status in employment,
10 public accommodation, and housing and may provide for the enforcement of
11 such ordinances by providing appropriate penalties for the violation
12 thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment practice to refuse
13 employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses if such policy
14 is equally applied to both sexes.
15 Sec. 8. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county
18 may adopt resolutions which are substantially equivalent to the Age
19 Discrimination in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice
20 Act, the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and
21 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
22 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
23 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
24 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to
25 those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or resolution may
26 include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages or other
-1-

AM1491 AM1491
LB150 LB150
AJC - 05/15/2025 AJC - 05/15/2025
1 equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a petition
2 in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
3 local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
4 equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission
5 or other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and
6 shall have authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to
7 enforce such orders or relief in the district court with appropriate
8 jurisdiction. Certified copies of such ordinances or resolutions shall be
9 transmitted to the commission. When the commission determines that any
10 such city or county has enacted an ordinance or adopted a resolution that
11 is substantially equivalent to such acts and sections or is more
12 comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
13 rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance or
14 resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
15 such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints
16 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
17 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
18 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
19 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
20 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
21 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
22 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
23 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties
24 or the interests of justice require such action, the commission may
25 regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in the same
26 manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies. In
27 cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
28 subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.
29 (2)(a) Any club which has been issued a license by the Nebraska
30 Liquor Control Commission to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic liquor
31 shall have that license revoked if the club discriminates because of

2 disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or national origin, or
3 military or veteran status in the sale, serving, or dispensing of
4 alcoholic liquor to any person who is a guest of a member of such club.
5 (b) The procedure for revocation shall be as prescribed in sections
6 53-134.04, 53-1,115, and 53-1,116.
7 (c) This subsection does not prohibit a club from, on an otherwise
8 nondiscriminatory basis, limiting admission or service to veterans or
9 servicemembers or their family members or providing discounts or other
10 benefits to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.
11 Sec. 9. Section 20-132, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 20-132 All persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and
14 equal enjoyment of any place of public accommodation, as defined in
15 sections 20-132 to 20-143, without discrimination or segregation on the
16 grounds of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, or
17 ancestry, or military or veteran status.
18 Sec. 10. Section 20-134, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 20-134 (1) Any person who directly or indirectly refuses, withholds
21 from, denies, or attempts to refuse, withhold, or deny, to any other
22 person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, services, or
23 privileges, or who segregates any person in a place of public
24 accommodation on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, religion, national
25 origin, disability, or ancestry, or military or veteran status, shall be
26 guilty of discriminatory practice and shall be subject to the penalties
27 of sections 20-132 to 20-143.
28 (2) It is not a discriminatory practice under sections 20-132 to
29 20-143 for a person or a place of public accommodation to, on an
30 otherwise nondiscriminatory basis, limit admission or service to veterans
31 or servicemembers or their family members or provide discounts or other

3 amended to read:
4 20-139 The Nebraska Fair Housing Act and sections 20-123, 20-124,
5 and 20-132 to 20-143 shall be administered by the Equal Opportunity
6 Commission, except that the State Fire Marshal shall administer the act
7 and sections as they relate to accessibility standards and specifications
8 set forth in sections 81-5,147 and 81-5,148. The county attorneys are
9 granted the authority to enforce such act and sections 20-123, 20-124,
10 and 20-132 to 20-143 and shall possess the same powers and duties with
11 respect thereto as the commission. If a complaint is filed with the
12 county attorney, the commission shall be notified. Powers granted to and
13 duties imposed upon the commission pursuant to such act and sections
14 shall be in addition to the provisions of the Nebraska Fair Employment
15 Practice Act and shall not be construed to amend or restrict those
16 provisions. In carrying out the Nebraska Fair Housing Act and sections
17 20-123, 20-124, and 20-132 to 20-143, the commission shall have the power
18 to:
19 (1) Seek to eliminate and prevent discrimination in places of public
20 accommodation because of race, color, sex, religion, national origin,
21 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in
22 section 20-308.01, or ancestry, or military or veteran status;
23 (2) Effectuate the purposes of sections 20-132 to 20-143 by
24 conference, conciliation, and persuasion so that persons may be
25 guaranteed their civil rights and goodwill may be fostered;
26 (3) Formulate policies to effectuate the purposes of sections 20-132
27 to 20-143 and make recommendations to agencies and officers of the state
28 or local subdivisions of government in aid of such policies and purposes;
29 (4) Adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the
30 powers granted by the Nebraska Fair Housing Act and sections 20-123,

4 regulations may incorporate regulations of the United States Department
5 of Housing and Urban Development as applicable;
6 (5) Designate one or more members of the commission or a member of
7 the commission staff to conduct investigations of any complaint alleging
8 discrimination because of race, color, sex, religion, national origin,
9 familial status, disability, or ancestry, or military or veteran status,
10 attempt to resolve such complaint by conference, conciliation, and
11 persuasion, and conduct such conciliation meetings and conferences as are

25 and
26 (10) Issue publications and the results of studies and research
27 which will tend to promote goodwill and minimize or eliminate

11 without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by either

6 hearing officer need not refer to the page and line numbers of the
7 transcript when making his or her recommendation to the commission. Such
8 findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be in sufficient detail to
9 enable a court on appeal to determine the controverted questions
10 presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight was given to the
11 evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
12 intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
13 employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such
14 respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from
15 such unlawful employment practice and order such other affirmative action
16 as may be appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to,
17 reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay
18 liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the
19 filing of the charge with the commission. Interim earnings or amounts
20 earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated
21 against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.

23 harm as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any
24 stage of the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in

26 If the complainant files a district court action on the charge, the
27 complainant shall provide written notice of such filing to the
28 commission, and such notification shall immediately terminate all
29 proceedings before the commission. The district court shall file and try

7 admission, suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or
8 advancement or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than
9 discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, disability,
10 marital status, or national origin, or military or veteran status or in
11 violation of section 48-1114. If the commission finds that a respondent
12 has not engaged in any unfair employment practice, it shall within thirty
13 days state its findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of any
14 order shall be served upon the person against whom it runs or his or her
15 attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to the
16 proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take effect twenty days
17 after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall continue in
