Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,

Section 3:
Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be cited as
the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
(1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current mental
health system, including a shortage of mental health care professionals and
long travel distances to receive care. These issues have had a negative impact
on those suffering from mental health issues and their communities,
particularly in rural parts of the state;
(2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to respond
and take the individual into emergency protective custody until the individual
can be transported to an available mental health treatment facility. This
places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies, particularly in rural
parts of the state, which is compounded by the shortage of mental health bed
space and long travel distances to facilities;
(3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and the
state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the negative
impact of mental health issues on individuals and law enforcement agencies;
-1-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
(4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
efficiently and cost-effectively; and
(5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of cooperation
and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those suffering from
mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that interact with them.
Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental health beds
and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to service the
region.
(2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate a
method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to address the
impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those suffering from
mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that can be replicated
statewide.
(3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency for the
pilot program. The selected agency shall:
(a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an existing
jail facility or elsewhere;
(b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement agencies;
(c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues and law
enforcement agencies; and
(d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies through a
memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds provide a regional
benefit.
(4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health Expansion
Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result in the
incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing in the act
should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is to expand mental
health services provided by law enforcement agencies to individuals temporarily
in custody for mental health issues.
Sec. 4. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
Justice shall administer the pilot program and, in addition to the requirements
set out in section 3 of this act, develop grant eligibility, application, and
audit requirements.
(2) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to carry
out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
(3) The commission shall identify grant funding to carry out the Regional
Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
Sec. 5. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice
shall coordinate with the Attorney General to carry out the Regional Mental
Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
Sec. 6. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice
shall create a pilot program to seek federal funding for collaborative efforts
in emergency response by law enforcement agencies and mental health
professionals.
Sec. 7. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define, regulate,
suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed,
religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin, familial status as
defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or age,
or military or veteran status in employment, public accommodation, and housing
and may provide for the enforcement of such ordinances by providing appropriate
penalties for the violation thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment
practice to refuse employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses
if such policy is equally applied to both sexes.
Sec. 8. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county may
adopt resolutions which are substantially equivalent to the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act, the Nebraska Fair
Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are
more comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
rights. No such ordinance or resolution shall place a duty or liability on any
person, other than an employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for
acts similar to those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or
resolution may include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages
or other equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a
petition in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission or
other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and shall have
authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to enforce such orders
or relief in the district court with appropriate jurisdiction. Certified copies
of such ordinances or resolutions shall be transmitted to the commission. When
the commission determines that any such city or county has enacted an ordinance
or adopted a resolution that is substantially equivalent to such acts and

Section 4:
sections or is more comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection
of civil rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance
-2-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
or resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints arising
within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such city when
both the city and the county in which the city is located have established
agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers a complaint to a
local agency, it shall take no further action on such complaint if the local
agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint pursuant to the local
ordinance or resolution. If the commission determines that a local agency is
not handling a complaint with reasonable promptness or that the protection of
the rights of the parties or the interests of justice require such action, the
commission may regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in
the same manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies.
In cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.
(2)(a) Any club which has been issued a license by the Nebraska Liquor
Control Commission to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic liquor shall have that
license revoked if the club discriminates because of race, color, religion,
sex, familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in

Section 5:
section 20-308.01, or national origin, or military or veteran status in the
sale, serving, or dispensing of alcoholic liquor to any person who is a guest
of a member of such club.
(b) The procedure for revocation shall be as prescribed in sections
53-134.04, 53-1,115, and 53-1,116.
(c) This subsection does not prohibit a club from, on an otherwise
nondiscriminatory basis, limiting admission or service to veterans or
servicemembers or their family members or providing discounts or other benefits
to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.
Sec. 9. Section 20-132, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
20-132 All persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and equal
enjoyment of any place of public accommodation, as defined in sections 20-132
to 20-143, without discrimination or segregation on the grounds of race, color,
sex, religion, national origin, disability, or ancestry, or military or veteran
status.
Sec. 10. Section 20-134, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
20-134 (1) Any person who directly or indirectly refuses, withholds from,
denies, or attempts to refuse, withhold, or deny, to any other person any of
the accommodations, advantages, facilities, services, or privileges, or who
segregates any person in a place of public accommodation on the basis of race,
creed, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, or ancestry, or
military or veteran status, shall be guilty of discriminatory practice and
shall be subject to the penalties of sections 20-132 to 20-143.
(2) It is not a discriminatory practice under sections 20-132 to 20-143
for a person or a place of public accommodation to, on an otherwise
nondiscriminatory basis, limit admission or service to veterans or
servicemembers or their family members or provide discounts or other benefits
to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.
Sec. 11. Section 20-139, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:

except that the State Fire Marshal shall administer the act and sections as
they relate to accessibility standards and specifications set forth in sections
81-5,147 and 81-5,148. The county attorneys are granted the authority to
enforce such act and sections 20-123, 20-124, and 20-132 to 20-143 and shall
possess the same powers and duties with respect thereto as the commission. If a
complaint is filed with the county attorney, the commission shall be notified.
Powers granted to and duties imposed upon the commission pursuant to such act
and sections shall be in addition to the provisions of the Nebraska Fair
Employment Practice Act and shall not be construed to amend or restrict those
provisions. In carrying out the Nebraska Fair Housing Act and sections 20-123,
20-124, and 20-132 to 20-143, the commission shall have the power to:
(1) Seek to eliminate and prevent discrimination in places of public
accommodation because of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, familial
status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in section
20-308.01, or ancestry, or military or veteran status;

regulations for the classified service. He or she shall give reasonable notice
thereof to the heads of all agencies, departments, county employee

personnel officer shall be responsible for the administration and maintenance
of the plan and for the allocation of each classified position. Any employee

record and the judgment creditor or his or her agent or attorney has filed an
affidavit setting forth the amount due on the judgment, interest, and costs in
the office of the clerk of the court where the judgment has been entered and
that he or she has good reason to and does believe that any person,
partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, naming him, her, or it,

nonexempt earnings, if any, withheld by the garnishee after service of the
order be transferred to the court for delivery to the judgment creditor who is
entitled to such earnings. Except for garnishments in support of a person, the
payments may be made payable to the judgment creditor or assignee and shall be

pay period or on a monthly basis if the garnishee so desires and shall deliver

judgment creditor shall continue for a second ninety-day period.
(4)(a) To determine priority, garnishments and liens shall rank according
to time of service.
(b) Garnishments, liens, and wage assignments which are not for the
support of a person shall be inferior to wage assignments for the support of a
person. Garnishments which are not for the support of a person and liens shall

debtor shall be in effect at one time. If an employee's wages are already being
garnished pursuant to a continuing lien at the time of service of a garnishment
upon an employer, the answer to garnishment interrogatories shall include such
information along with the date of termination of such continuing lien and the
title of the case from which such garnishment is issued. Except as provided in

agents for service of process on its website for access by the public. A
financial institution may modify or revoke a designation made under this
subdivision by filing the modification or revocation with the department. The
modification or revocation shall be effective when the department's website has
been updated to reflect the modification or revocation, except that the
judgment creditor may rely upon the designation that was modified or revoked
during the thirty-day period following the effective date of the modification
or revocation if the summons is timely served upon the financial institution.

institution pursuant to this subdivision or a modification or revocation filed
by a financial institution pursuant to this subdivision within ten business
days following the filing by the financial institution. The department website

its main chartered office or one of its offices or branches or its agent for
service of process for the service of summons, service made on the main
chartered office or the office or branch or the agent for service of process so
designated shall be valid and effective as to any property or credits of the
defendant in the possession or control of the main chartered office of the
financial institution in this state and any of the financial institution
offices or branches located within this state. If service of summons is not
made on the main chartered office or the office or branch or the agent for
service of process designated by the financial institution, but instead is made
at another office or branch of the financial institution located in Nebraska,

obligation to its customer, may elect to treat the service of summons as valid
and effective as to any property or credits of the defendant in the possession
or control of the main chartered office of the financial institution in this
state and any of the financial institution offices or branches located within
this state. In the absence of such an election, the financial institution shall
file a statement with the interrogatories that the summons was not served at
the financial institution's designated location for receiving service of
summons and, therefore, was not processed, and shall provide the address at
which the financial institution is to receive service of summons.

savings bank, building and loan association, savings and loan association, or
credit union whether chartered by the United States, the Department of Banking

creditor.

officer deems relevant or the court directs to be included. All local and state
police agencies and Department of Correctional Services adult correctional
facilities shall furnish to the probation officer copies of such criminal
records, in any such case referred to the probation officer by the court of
proper jurisdiction, as the probation officer shall require without cost to the
court or the probation officer.
Such investigation shall also include:
(a) Any written statements submitted to the county attorney by a victim;
and
(b) Any written statements submitted to the probation officer by a victim.

or mental hospital, or the court may appoint a qualified psychiatrist to make
the examination. The report of the examination shall be submitted to the court.
(6)(a) Any presentence report, substance abuse evaluation, or psychiatric
examination shall be privileged and shall not be disclosed directly or
indirectly to anyone other than a judge; probation officers to whom an
offender's file is duly transferred; the probation administrator or his or her
designee; alcohol and drug counselors, mental health practitioners,
psychiatrists, and psychologists licensed or certified under the Uniform
Credentialing Act to conduct substance abuse evaluations and treatment; or

(7) The court shall permit inspection of the presentence report, substance
abuse evaluation, or psychiatric examination or parts of the report,
evaluation, or examination, as determined by the court, by the prosecuting
attorney and defense counsel. Such inspection shall be by electronic access
only unless the court determines such access is not available to the
prosecuting attorney or defense counsel. The State Court Administrator shall
determine and develop the means of electronic access to such presentence
reports, evaluations, and examinations. Upon application by the prosecuting
attorney or defense counsel, the court may order that addresses, telephone
numbers, and other contact information for victims or witnesses named in the
report, evaluation, or examination be redacted upon a showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that such redaction is warranted in the interests
-19-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
of public safety. The court may permit inspection of the presentence report,
substance abuse evaluation, or psychiatric examination or examination of parts
of the report, evaluation, or examination by any other person having a proper
interest therein whenever the court finds it is in the best interest of a
particular offender. The court may allow fair opportunity for an offender to
provide additional information for the court's consideration.
(8) If an offender is sentenced to imprisonment, a copy of the report of
any presentence investigation, substance abuse evaluation, or psychiatric
examination shall be transmitted immediately to the Department of Correctional

public safety, the risk of the defendant committing additional offenses, (ii)

should be instituted, or criminal prosecution, and (iii) of his or her right to

Sec. 40. Sections 29-4801 to 29-4807 apply on and after July 1, 2027.
Sec. 41. Section 29-4803, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
29-4803 (1) The probation administrator shall create a veteran justice
program as provided in sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 and subject to the Supreme
Court's rules. The program shall be available in every district court and
county court. A veteran justice program shall not supersede, alter, or
otherwise interfere with the establishment, functioning, participation, or
operation of a problem solving court established pursuant to section 24-1302.
(2) A veteran justice program shall be operated by use of deferred
judgments as provided in this section.
(3) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of conviction may be
rendered, a defendant that is eligible to participate in a veteran justice
program may request the court defer the entry of judgment of conviction under
this section. Upon such request, the court shall provide notice to any victim
of the offense of the request and provide an opportunity for the victim to
provide a statement for consideration by the court. After giving the prosecutor
and defendant the opportunity to be heard, the court may defer the entry of a
judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence and place the defendant
on probation, upon conditions as the court may require under sections 29-2262
and 29-4804. If the court defers the entry of judgment, the court shall provide
notice to victims of the offense.
(4)(a) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment under this

Section 26:
section, the court shall consider the following:
(i) The factors set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of section 29-2260
and section 29-4802;
(ii) The supervision, treatment, and other programming options available
in the community; and
(iii) Any other information the court deems relevant.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(c) of this section, there shall
be a presumption that a veteran eligible under section 29-4802 shall be allowed
to participate in a veteran justice program. The presumption shall only be
overcome by a judicial finding, based on an individualized assessment of the
veteran and consideration of the factors set forth in subdivisions (4)(a)(i),
(ii), and (iii) of this section, that entry of judgment of conviction should
not be deferred. The fact that a veteran has previously absconded from or
violated pretrial release, probation, parole, supervised release, post-release
supervision, or another form of court-ordered supervision, including a
violation arising from commission of a new offense or an offense committed
while previously participating in a veteran justice program, is not, standing
alone, a sufficient basis to overcome the presumption.
(c) The presumption provided for in subdivision (4)(b) of this section
-22-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
does not apply to a veteran charged with:
(i) A violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, or a city or village
ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, following a
previous conviction for a violation of any such section or ordinance; or
(ii) An offense that resulted in serious bodily injury to another person.
(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections 29-2293 and
29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant to a deferred
judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation Administration Act and

Section 27:
sections 29-2270 to 29-2273.
(6) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an opportunity
to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated a condition of his
or her probation, the court may enter any order authorized by section 29-2268
or pronounce judgment and impose such new sentence as might have been
originally imposed for the offense for which the defendant was convicted.
(7) Upon satisfactory completion of the conditions of probation and the
payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed under

Section 28:
section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to withdraw any
plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action without entry of
judgment. The court shall not grant such motion until a victim of the offense
has received notice and the opportunity to be heard, as required by subsection
(4) of section 29-4804.
(8) Sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 apply to offenses committed on or after
July 1, 2027 2025. For purposes of this subsection, an offense shall be deemed
to have been committed prior to July 1, 2027 2025, if any element of the
offense occurred prior to such date.
Sec. 42. Section 29-4807, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is

participate in a veteran justice program, including completion status,
recidivism, and housing and employment status.
(3) Data collected under this section shall be disaggregated by race,
ethnicity, gender, age, military discharge characterization, and the offense
involved.
(4) On or before July 1, 2028 2026, and on or before each July 1
thereafter, the State Court Administrator shall electronically submit a report
to the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature. The report shall contain de-
identified data collected pursuant to this section and shall analyze the
outcomes, successes, and areas for improvement of the veteran justice programs
and the sentencing mitigation described in section 29-4805.

connection therewith, to require the production for examination of any books
and papers relevant to any allegation of unlawful employment practice pending
before the commission. The commission may make rules as to the issuance of
subpoenas, subject to the approval by a constitutional majority of the elected
members of the Legislature;
(3) To cooperate with the federal government and with local agencies to
effectuate the purposes of the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act, including
the sharing of information possessed by the commission on a case that has also
been filed with the federal government or local agencies if both the employer

being committed, (b) preserve such records for such periods, and (c) make such
reports therefrom, as the commission shall prescribe by regulation or order,
after public hearing, as reasonable, necessary, or appropriate for the
enforcement of the act or the regulations or orders thereunder. The commission
shall, by regulation, require each employer, labor organization, and joint
labor-management committee subject to the act which controls an apprenticeship
or other training program to maintain such records as are reasonably necessary
to carry out the purposes of the act, including, but not limited to, a list of
applicants who wish to participate in such program, including the chronological
order in which such applications were received, and to furnish to the
commission, upon request, a detailed description of the manner in which persons

Any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management
committee which believes that the application to it of any regulation or order
issued under this section would result in undue hardship may either apply to
the commission for an exemption from the application of such regulation or
order or bring a civil action in the district court for the district where such
records are kept. If the commission or the court, as the case may be, finds
that the application of the regulation or order to the employer, employment
agency, or labor organization in question would impose an undue hardship, the
commission or the court, as the case may be, may grant appropriate relief;
(6) To report, not less than once every two years, to the Clerk of the
Legislature and the Governor, on the hearings it has conducted and the
decisions it has rendered, the other work performed by it to carry out the
purposes of the act, and to make recommendations for such further legislation
concerning abuses and discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex,
disability, marital status, or national origin, or military or veteran status,
as may be desirable. The report shall also include the number of complaints
filed under the act alleging a violation of subdivision (2) of section
48-1107.01 and the resolution of such complaints. The report submitted to the
Clerk of the Legislature shall be submitted electronically. Each member of the
Legislature shall receive an electronic copy of the report required by this

the duties prescribed in the act.

practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, persuasion,
mediation, or arbitration, the commission may order a public hearing. If such
hearing is ordered, the commission shall cause to be issued and served a
written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, requiring the person,
employer, labor organization, or employment agency named in the complaint,
hereinafter referred to as respondent, to answer such charges at a hearing
before the commission at a time and place which shall be specified in such
notice. Such hearing shall be within the county where the alleged unlawful
employment practice occurred. The complainant shall be a party to the
proceeding, and in the discretion of the commission any other person whose
testimony has a bearing on the matter may be allowed to intervene therein. Both
the complainant and the respondent, in addition to the commission, may
-38-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
introduce witnesses at the hearing. The respondent may file a verified answer
to the allegations of the complaint and may appear at such hearing in person
and with or without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by
either party. All evidence shall be under oath and a record thereof shall be
made and preserved. Such proceedings shall, so far as practicable, be conducted
in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of
the State of Nebraska, and shall be of public record.
(2) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any book,
document, paper, or account in any investigation, or inquiry by, or hearing
before the commission when ordered to do so, upon the ground that the testimony
or evidence, book, document, paper, or account required of such person may tend
to incriminate such person in or subject such person to penalty or forfeiture;
but no person shall be prosecuted, punished, or subjected to any forfeiture or
penalty for or on account of any act, transaction, matter, or thing concerning
which such person shall have been compelled under oath to testify or produce
documentary evidence, except that no person so testifying shall be exempt from
prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by such person in his or
her testimony. Such immunity shall extend only to a natural person who, in
obedience to a subpoena, gives testimony under oath or produces evidence,
documentary or otherwise, under oath. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed as precluding any person from claiming any right or privilege
available to such person under the Fifth Amendment fifth amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.
(3) After the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall, within ten
days of the receipt of the transcript or the receipt of the recommendations
from the hearing officer, make and file its findings of fact and conclusions of
law and make and enter an appropriate order. The hearing officer need not refer
to the page and line numbers of the transcript when making his or her
recommendation to the commission. Such findings of fact and conclusions of law
shall be in sufficient detail to enable a court on appeal to determine the
controverted questions presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight
was given to the evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent
an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful
employment practice and order such other affirmative action as may be
appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to, reinstatement or
hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay liability shall not
accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of the charge with
the commission. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence
by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the
backpay otherwise allowable.
(4) A complainant who has suffered physical, emotional, or financial harm
as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any stage of
the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in the district
court of the county where such alleged violation occurred. If the complainant
files a district court action on the charge, the complainant shall provide
written notice of such filing to the commission, and such notification shall
immediately terminate all proceedings before the commission. The district court
shall file and try such case as any other civil action, and any successful
complainant shall be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or
permanent injunctive relief, general and special damages, reasonable attorney's
fees, and costs.
(5) No order of the commission shall require the admission or
reinstatement of an individual as a member of a labor organization or the
hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or the
payment to him or her of any backpay, if such individual was refused admission,
suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or advancement or was
suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of
race, color, religion, sex, disability, marital status, or national origin, or
military or veteran status or in violation of section 48-1114. If the
commission finds that a respondent has not engaged in any unfair employment
practice, it shall within thirty days state its findings of fact and
conclusions of law. A copy of any order shall be served upon the person against
whom it runs or his or her attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the
other parties to the proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take
effect twenty days after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall
continue in force either for a period which may be designated therein or until
changed or revoked by the commission.
(6) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, until a
transcript of the record of the proceedings is filed in the district court as
provided in section 48-1120, the commission may, at any time upon reasonable
notice and in such a manner it shall deem proper, modify or set aside, in whole
or in part, any finding or order made by it.
Sec. 89. Section 48-1122, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
48-1122 Every contract to which the state or any of its political
subdivisions is a party shall contain a provision requiring the contractor and
his or her subcontractors not to discriminate against any employee or applicant

approval of the director after the offender has been notified regarding the
charges of misconduct.
(4) The department, in consultation with the board, shall ensure that a
release or reentry plan is complete or near completion when the offender has
served at least eighty percent of his or her sentence. For purposes of this
subsection, release or reentry plan means a comprehensive and individualized
strategic plan to ensure an individual's safe and effective transition or
reentry into the community to which he or she resides with the primary goal of
reducing recidivism. At a minimum, the release or reentry plan shall include,
but not be limited to, consideration of the individual's housing needs, medical
or mental health care needs, and transportation and job needs and shall address
an individual's barriers to successful release or reentry in order to prevent
-62-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
recidivism. The release or reentry plan does not include an individual's
programming needs included in the individual's personalized program plan for
use inside the prison. However, the department shall include in the release or
reentry plan information regarding the individual's progress on the
individual's personalized program plan for use inside the prison.
(5)(a) The department shall make treatment programming available to
committed offenders as provided in section 83-1,110.01 and shall include
continuing participation in such programming as part of each offender's
department-approved personalized program plan developed under subsection (1) of
this section.
(b) Any committed offender with a mental illness shall be provided with
the community standard of mental health care. The mental health care shall
utilize evidence-based therapy models that include an evaluation component to
track the effectiveness of interventions.
(c) Any committed offender with a mental illness shall be evaluated before
release to ensure that adequate monitoring and treatment of the committed
offender will take place or, if appropriate, that a commitment proceeding under
the Nebraska Mental Health Commitment Act or the Sex Offender Commitment Act
will take place.
(6)(a) Within thirty days after any committed offender has been paroled,
all available information regarding such parolee shall be reviewed and a case
plan document shall be drawn up and approved by the department Division of
Parole Supervision. The document shall specifically describe the approved case
plan and the specific goals the department division expects the parolee to
achieve. The document shall also contain a realistic schedule for completion of
the approved case plan. The approved case plan shall be developed with the
active participation of the parolee. During the term of parole, the parolee
shall comply with the approved case plan and the department division shall
provide programs to allow compliance by the parolee with the approved case
plan.
Programming may include, but is not limited to:
(i) Academic and vocational education;
(ii) Substance abuse treatment;
(iii) Mental health and psychiatric treatment, including criminal
personality programming;
(iv) Constructive, meaningful work programs;
(v) Community service programs; and
(vi) Any other program deemed necessary and appropriate by the department
division.
(b) A modification in the approved case plan may be made to account for
the increased or decreased abilities of the parolee or the availability of any
program. Any modification shall be made only after notice is given to the
parolee. Intentional failure to comply with the approved case plan by any
parolee as scheduled for any year, or pro rata part thereof, shall cause
disciplinary action to be taken by the department division resulting in the
forfeiture of up to a maximum of three months' good time for the scheduled
year.
(7) While the offender is in the custody of the board, reductions of terms
granted pursuant to subdivision (2)(a) of this section may be forfeited,
withheld, and restored by the director upon the recommendation of the board
after the offender has been notified regarding the charges of misconduct or
breach of the conditions of parole.
(8) Good time or other reductions of sentence granted under the provisions
of any law prior to July 1, 1996, may be forfeited, withheld, or restored in
accordance with the terms of the Nebraska Treatment and Corrections Act.
(9) Pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the probation
administrator and the director, an individualized post-release supervision plan
shall be collaboratively prepared by the Office of Probation Administration and
the department and provided to the court to prepare individuals under custody
of the department for post-release supervision. All records created during the
period of incarceration shall be shared with the Office of Probation
Administration and considered in preparation of the post-release supervision
plan.
Sec. 149. Section 83-1,107.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
83-1,107.01 (1) Unless otherwise provided by this section, whenever an
adult offender is paroled, the board shall require a parolee to pay a monthly
parole programming fee.
(2) Parolees under the supervision of the department Division of Parole
Supervision shall pay a monthly parole programming fee of twenty-five dollars,
not later than the tenth day of each month, beginning the second month of
parole supervision and continuing for the duration of the parole.
(3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming fee in
whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that such payment
would constitute an undue hardship on the parolee due to limited income,
employment or school status, or physical or mental handicap. Such waiver shall
be in effect only during the period of time that the parolee is unable to pay
his or her monthly parole programming fee.
(4) When monthly parole programming fees are waived, in whole or in part,
the parole officer, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the board, may
contract with the parolee to perform approved community service at the rate of
five dollars per hour in lieu of payment of monthly parole programming fees. A
parolee may be required to pay a participation fee in order to take advantage
-63-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
of community service programs. A parolee may not accumulate more than three
months' advance credit for community service. The use of community service
alternatives does not preclude the imposition of other intermediate measures.
(5) The department, division with the approval of the Board of Parole,
shall implement sanctions if a parolee defaults in the payment of monthly
parole programming fees or any installment thereof as established by subsection
(2) of this section, except that parole shall not be revoked nor shall the
parolee be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the parolee is financially unable
to make the payment.
(6) If the board determines that the default in payment described in
subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate refusal to
obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's part to make a good
faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment, the board may allow the
parolee additional time for payment, reduce the amount of each installment, or
revoke the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.
(7) No parolee shall be required to pay more than one monthly parole
programming fee per month.
(8) The imposition of monthly parole programming fees in this section
shall be considered separate and apart from specific service delivery fees.

29-2637 or the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision shall be
assessed a monthly parole programming fee during the period of time the
offender is actively supervised by Nebraska parole authorities.

department division. The department division shall remit all fees to the State
Treasurer for credit to the Parole Program Cash Fund.

amended to read:

from the director Director of Supervision and Services, a parolee has shown
suitable compliance with his or her parole programming plan, the board may
reduce the level of supervision for a parolee that is commensurate with the
best interests of the parolee and is compatible with the protection of the
public.
(2) The board shall discharge a parolee from parole when the time served
in the custody of the department and the time served on parole equal the
maximum term less good time.
(3) The department shall discharge a committed offender from the custody
of the department when the time served in the facility equals the maximum term
less good time.
(4) Upon completion of the lawful requirements of the sentence, the

(3) Whenever a parole officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
parolee has committed or is about to commit a substance abuse violation or
technical violation while on parole, but that the parolee will not attempt to
leave the jurisdiction and will not place lives or property in danger, the
parole officer shall either:
(a) Impose one or more administrative sanctions based upon the parolee's
risk level, the severity of the violation, and the parolee's response to the
violation. If administrative sanctions are to be imposed, the parolee shall
acknowledge in writing the nature of the violation and agree upon the
administrative sanction. The parolee has the right to decline to acknowledge
the violation. If he or she declines to acknowledge the violation, the parole

return the offender to serve the remainder of the parole term or such part as
the board may determine.
(4) If a person paroled to a warrant or detainer is thereafter sentenced

Sec. 157. Section 83-962, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
83-962 (1) A correctional system overcrowding emergency shall exist
whenever the director certifies that the department's inmate population is over
one hundred forty percent of operational design capacity. The director shall so
certify within thirty days after the date on which the population first exceeds
one hundred forty percent of operational design capacity.
(2) During a correctional system overcrowding emergency, the board shall
immediately consider or reconsider committed offenders eligible for parole who
have not been released on parole.
(3) Upon such consideration or reconsideration, and for all other
consideration of committed offenders eligible for parole while the correctional
system overcrowding emergency is in effect, the board shall order the release
of each committed offender unless it is of the opinion that such release should
be deferred because:
(a) The board has determined that it is more likely than not that the
committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
(b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the
facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a law-
abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed offender
would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on institutional
discipline; or
(c) The board has determined that there is a very substantial risk that
the committed offender will commit a violent act against a person.
(4) In making the determination regarding the risk that a committed
offender will not conform to the conditions of parole, the board shall take
into account the factors set forth in subsection (2) of section 83-1,114 and
shall comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of section 83-1,114 and

Section 56:
section 83-196.01.
(5) The board shall continue granting parole to offenders under this

Section 57:
section until the director certifies that the population is at operational
capacity. The director shall so certify within thirty days after the date on
which the population first reaches operational capacity.

emergency.
Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be cited as
the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
(1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current mental
health system, including a shortage of mental health care professionals and
long travel distances to receive care. These issues have had a negative impact
on those suffering from mental health issues and their communities,
particularly in rural parts of the state;
(2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to respond
and take the individual into emergency protective custody until the individual
can be transported to an available mental health treatment facility. This
places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies, particularly in rural
parts of the state, which is compounded by the shortage of mental health bed
space and long travel distances to facilities;
(3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and the
state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the negative
impact of mental health issues on individuals and law enforcement agencies;
-1-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
(4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
efficiently and cost-effectively; and
(5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of cooperation
and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those suffering from
mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that interact with them.
Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental health beds
and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to service the
region.
(2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate a
method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to address the
impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those suffering from
mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that can be replicated
statewide.
(3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency for the
pilot program. The selected agency shall:
(a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an existing
jail facility or elsewhere;
(b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement agencies;
(c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues and law
enforcement agencies; and
(d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies through a
memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds provide a regional
benefit.
(4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health Expansion
Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result in the
incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing in the act
should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is to expand mental
health services provided by law enforcement agencies to individuals temporarily
in custody for mental health issues.
Sec. 4. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
Justice shall administer the pilot program and, in addition to the requirements
set out in section 3 of this act, develop grant eligibility, application, and
audit requirements.
(2) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to carry
out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
(3) The commission shall identify grant funding to carry out the Regional
Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
Sec. 5. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice
shall coordinate with the Attorney General to carry out the Regional Mental
Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
Sec. 6. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice
shall create a pilot program to seek federal funding for collaborative efforts
in emergency response by law enforcement agencies and mental health
professionals.
Sec. 7. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define, regulate,
suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed,
religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin, familial status as
defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or age,
or military or veteran status in employment, public accommodation, and housing
and may provide for the enforcement of such ordinances by providing appropriate
penalties for the violation thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment
practice to refuse employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses
if such policy is equally applied to both sexes.
Sec. 8. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county may
adopt resolutions which are substantially equivalent to the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act, the Nebraska Fair
Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are
more comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
rights. No such ordinance or resolution shall place a duty or liability on any
person, other than an employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for
acts similar to those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or
resolution may include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages
or other equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a
petition in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission or
other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and shall have

or

Sec. 22. Section 25-1056, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
25-1056 (1) In all cases when a judgment has been entered by any court of
record and the judgment creditor or his or her agent or attorney has filed an
affidavit setting forth the amount due on the judgment, interest, and costs in
the office of the clerk of the court where the judgment has been entered and
that he or she has good reason to and does believe that any person,
partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, naming him, her, or it,
has property of and is indebted to the judgment debtor, the clerk shall issue a
summons which shall set forth the amount due on the judgment, interest, and
costs as shown in the affidavit and require such person, partnership, limited
liability company, or corporation, as garnishee, to answer written
interrogatories to be furnished by the plaintiff and to be attached to such
summons respecting the matters set forth in section 25-1026. The summons shall
be returnable within ten days from the date of its issuance and shall require
the garnishee to answer within ten days from the date of service upon him or
her. Except when wages are involved, the garnishee shall hold the property of
every description and the credits of the defendant in his or her possession or
under his or her control at the time of the service of the summons and
interrogatories until the further order of the court. If the only property in
the possession or under the control of the garnishee at the time of the service
of the summons and interrogatories is credits of the defendant and the amount
of such credits is not in dispute by the garnishee, then such garnishee shall
only hold the credits of the defendant in his or her possession or under his or
her control at the time of the service of the summons and interrogatories to
the extent of the amount of the judgment, interest, and costs set forth in the
summons until further order of the court. When wages are involved, the
garnishee shall pay to the employee all disposable earnings exempted from
garnishment by statute, and any disposable earnings remaining after such
payment shall be retained by the garnishee until further order of the court.
Thereafter, the service of the summons and interrogatories and all further
proceedings shall be in all respects the same as is provided for in sections
25-1011 and 25-1026 to 25-1031.01 unless inconsistent with this section.
(2) If it appears from the answer of the garnishee that the judgment
debtor was an employee of the garnishee, that the garnishee otherwise owed
earnings to the judgment debtor when the garnishment order was served, or that
earnings would be owed within sixty days thereafter and there is not a
successful written objection to the order or the answer of the garnishee filed,
on application by the judgment creditor, the court shall order that the
nonexempt earnings, if any, withheld by the garnishee after service of the
order be transferred to the court for delivery to the judgment creditor who is
entitled to such earnings. Except for garnishments in support of a person, the
payments may be made payable to the judgment creditor or assignee and shall be
forwarded to the issuing court to record the judgment payment prior to the
court delivering the payment to the judgment creditor or assignee. The court
shall, upon application of the judgment creditor, further order that the
garnishment is a continuing lien against the nonexempt earnings of the judgment
debtor. An order of continuing lien on nonexempt earnings entered pursuant to
this section shall require the garnishee to continue to withhold the nonexempt
earnings of the judgment debtor for as long as the continuing lien remains in
effect.
Beginning with the pay period during which the writ was served and while
the continuing lien remains in effect, the garnishee shall deliver the
nonexempt earnings to the court from which the garnishment was issued for each
pay period or on a monthly basis if the garnishee so desires and shall deliver
to the judgment debtor his or her exempt earnings for each pay period.

(b) The judgment debtor leaves the garnishee's employ for more than sixty
days;
(c) The judgment creditor releases the garnishment;
(d) The proceedings are stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction,

including the United States Bankruptcy Court;
(e) The judgment debtor has not earned any nonexempt earnings for at least
sixty days;
(f) The court orders that the garnishment be quashed; or
(g) Ninety days have expired since service of the writ. The judgment
creditor may extend the lien for a second ninety-day period by filing with the
court a notice of extension during the fifteen days immediately prior to the
expiration of the initial lien, and the continuing lien in favor of the initial
judgment creditor shall continue for a second ninety-day period.
(4)(a) To determine priority, garnishments and liens shall rank according
to time of service.
(b) Garnishments, liens, and wage assignments which are not for the
support of a person shall be inferior to wage assignments for the support of a
person. Garnishments which are not for the support of a person and liens shall
be inferior to garnishments for the support of a person.
(5) Only one order of continuing lien against earnings due the judgment
debtor shall be in effect at one time. If an employee's wages are already being
garnished pursuant to a continuing lien at the time of service of a garnishment
upon an employer, the answer to garnishment interrogatories shall include such
information along with the date of termination of such continuing lien and the
title of the case from which such garnishment is issued. Except as provided in
subsection (4) of this section, a continuing lien obtained pursuant to this
section shall have priority over any subsequent garnishment or wage assignment.
(6)(a) In any case involving service of a garnishment summons on a
financial institution where deposits are received within this state, the
financial institution shall (i) if its main chartered office is located in this
state, designate its main chartered office for the service of summons or (ii)
if its main chartered office is located in another state, designate any one of
its offices or branches or its agent for service of process in this state for
service of summons. The designation of a main chartered office or an office or
branch or the agent for service of process under this subdivision shall be made
by filing a notice of designation with the Department of Banking and Finance,
shall contain the physical address of the main chartered office or the office
or branch or the agent for service of process designated, and shall be
effective upon placement on the department website. The department shall post
the list of such designated main chartered offices and offices or branches or
agents for service of process on its website for access by the public. A
financial institution may modify or revoke a designation made under this
subdivision by filing the modification or revocation with the department. The
modification or revocation shall be effective when the department's website has
been updated to reflect the modification or revocation, except that the
judgment creditor may rely upon the designation that was modified or revoked
during the thirty-day period following the effective date of the modification
or revocation if the summons is timely served upon the financial institution.
The department shall update its website to reflect a filing by a financial
institution pursuant to this subdivision or a modification or revocation filed
by a financial institution pursuant to this subdivision within ten business
days following the filing by the financial institution. The department website
shall reflect the date its online records for each financial institution have
most recently been updated.
(b) If a financial institution where deposits are received has designated
its main chartered office or one of its offices or branches or its agent for
service of process for the service of summons, service made on the main
chartered office or the office or branch or the agent for service of process so
designated shall be valid and effective as to any property or credits of the
defendant in the possession or control of the main chartered office of the
financial institution in this state and any of the financial institution
offices or branches located within this state. If service of summons is not
made on the main chartered office or the office or branch or the agent for
service of process designated by the financial institution, but instead is made
at another office or branch of the financial institution located in Nebraska,
the financial institution, in its discretion, and without violating any
obligation to its customer, may elect to treat the service of summons as valid
and effective as to any property or credits of the defendant in the possession
or control of the main chartered office of the financial institution in this
state and any of the financial institution offices or branches located within
this state. In the absence of such an election, the financial institution shall
file a statement with the interrogatories that the summons was not served at
the financial institution's designated location for receiving service of
summons and, therefore, was not processed, and shall provide the address at
which the financial institution is to receive service of summons.
(c) For purposes of this subsection, financial institution means a bank,
savings bank, building and loan association, savings and loan association, or
credit union whether chartered by the United States, the Department of Banking
and Finance, or a foreign state agency.
(d) The notice of designation, modification, or revocation shall be made
by a financial institution on forms prescribed by the Department of Banking and
Finance department.

or any person acting on behalf of the department shall be immune from civil and
criminal liability for any acts or omissions which occur as a result of the
requirements of this subsection.

creditor.
(c) If service is not made upon the corporate entity's registered agent
for service of process in this state, the judgment creditor shall send a copy

no such copy be sent or no such registered agent exists. Proof of compliance
with this subdivision (7)(c) is not required for a garnishment to continue.

(a) The request is material to the preparation of the defense;

prosecution or its witnesses;

made;

(2) When punishment of an accused as a habitual criminal is sought, the
facts with reference thereto shall be charged in the indictment or information

but the fact that the accused is charged with being a habitual criminal shall
not be an issue upon the trial of the felony charge and shall not in any manner

29-2261 (1) Unless it is impractical to do so, when an offender has been

offender and according due consideration to a written report of such
investigation. When an offender has been convicted of murder in the first
degree and (a) a jury renders a verdict finding the existence of one or more
aggravating circumstances as provided in section 29-2520 or (b)(i) the
information contains a notice of aggravation as provided in section 29-1603 and
(ii) the offender waives his or her right to a jury determination of the
alleged aggravating circumstances, the court shall not commence the sentencing
determination proceeding as provided in section 29-2521 without first ordering
a presentence investigation of the offender and according due consideration to
a written report of such investigation.
(2) A court may order a presentence investigation in any case, except in
cases in which an offender has been convicted of a Class IIIA misdemeanor, a
Class IV misdemeanor, a Class V misdemeanor, a traffic infraction, or any
corresponding city or village ordinance.
(3) The presentence investigation and report shall include, when
available, an analysis of the circumstances attending the commission of the
crime, the offender's history of delinquency or criminality, physical and
mental condition, family situation and background, economic status, education,
occupation, and personal habits, and any other matters that the probation
officer deems relevant or the court directs to be included. All local and state
police agencies and Department of Correctional Services adult correctional
facilities shall furnish to the probation officer copies of such criminal
records, in any such case referred to the probation officer by the court of
proper jurisdiction, as the probation officer shall require without cost to the
court or the probation officer.
Such investigation shall also include:
(a) Any written statements submitted to the county attorney by a victim;
and
(b) Any written statements submitted to the probation officer by a victim.
(4) If there are no written statements submitted to the probation officer,
he or she shall certify to the court that:
(a) He or she has attempted to contact the victim; and
(b) If he or she has contacted the victim, such officer offered to accept
the written statements of the victim or to reduce such victim's oral statements
to writing.
For purposes of subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the term victim
shall be as defined in section 29-119.
(5) Before imposing sentence, the court may order the offender to submit
to psychiatric observation and examination for a period of not exceeding sixty
days or such longer period as the court determines to be necessary for that
purpose. The offender may be remanded for this purpose to any available clinic
or mental hospital, or the court may appoint a qualified psychiatrist to make
the examination. The report of the examination shall be submitted to the court.
(6)(a) Any presentence report, substance abuse evaluation, or psychiatric
examination shall be privileged and shall not be disclosed directly or
indirectly to anyone other than a judge; probation officers to whom an
offender's file is duly transferred; the probation administrator or his or her
designee; alcohol and drug counselors, mental health practitioners,
psychiatrists, and psychologists licensed or certified under the Uniform
Credentialing Act to conduct substance abuse evaluations and treatment; or
others entitled by law to receive such information, including personnel and
mental health professionals for the Nebraska State Patrol specifically assigned
to sex offender registration and community notification for the sole purpose of
using such report, evaluation, or examination for assessing risk and for
community notification of registered sex offenders.
(b) For purposes of this subsection, mental health professional means (i)
a practicing physician licensed to practice medicine in this state under the
Medicine and Surgery Practice Act, (ii) a practicing psychologist licensed to
engage in the practice of psychology in this state as provided in section

Interjurisdictional Compact, (iii) a practicing mental health professional
licensed or certified in this state as provided in the Mental Health Practice
Act, or (iv) a practicing professional counselor holding a privilege to
practice in Nebraska under the Licensed Professional Counselors Interstate
Compact.
(7) The court shall permit inspection of the presentence report, substance
abuse evaluation, or psychiatric examination or parts of the report,
evaluation, or examination, as determined by the court, by the prosecuting
attorney and defense counsel. Such inspection shall be by electronic access
only unless the court determines such access is not available to the
prosecuting attorney or defense counsel. The State Court Administrator shall
determine and develop the means of electronic access to such presentence
reports, evaluations, and examinations. Upon application by the prosecuting
attorney or defense counsel, the court may order that addresses, telephone
numbers, and other contact information for victims or witnesses named in the
report, evaluation, or examination be redacted upon a showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that such redaction is warranted in the interests
-19-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
of public safety. The court may permit inspection of the presentence report,
substance abuse evaluation, or psychiatric examination or examination of parts
of the report, evaluation, or examination by any other person having a proper
interest therein whenever the court finds it is in the best interest of a
particular offender. The court may allow fair opportunity for an offender to
provide additional information for the court's consideration.
(8) If an offender is sentenced to imprisonment, a copy of the report of
any presentence investigation, substance abuse evaluation, or psychiatric
examination shall be transmitted immediately to the Department of Correctional
Services. Upon request, the department shall provide a copy of the report to
the Board of Parole , the Division of Parole Supervision, and the Board of
Pardons.

Sec. 40. Sections 29-4801 to 29-4807 apply on and after July 1, 2027.
Sec. 41. Section 29-4803, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
29-4803 (1) The probation administrator shall create a veteran justice
program as provided in sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 and subject to the Supreme
Court's rules. The program shall be available in every district court and
county court. A veteran justice program shall not supersede, alter, or
otherwise interfere with the establishment, functioning, participation, or
operation of a problem solving court established pursuant to section 24-1302.
(2) A veteran justice program shall be operated by use of deferred
judgments as provided in this section.
(3) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of conviction may be
rendered, a defendant that is eligible to participate in a veteran justice
program may request the court defer the entry of judgment of conviction under
this section. Upon such request, the court shall provide notice to any victim
of the offense of the request and provide an opportunity for the victim to
provide a statement for consideration by the court. After giving the prosecutor
and defendant the opportunity to be heard, the court may defer the entry of a
judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence and place the defendant
on probation, upon conditions as the court may require under sections 29-2262
and 29-4804. If the court defers the entry of judgment, the court shall provide
notice to victims of the offense.
(4)(a) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment under this
section, the court shall consider the following:
(i) The factors set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of section 29-2260
and section 29-4802;
(ii) The supervision, treatment, and other programming options available
in the community; and
(iii) Any other information the court deems relevant.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(c) of this section, there shall
be a presumption that a veteran eligible under section 29-4802 shall be allowed
to participate in a veteran justice program. The presumption shall only be
overcome by a judicial finding, based on an individualized assessment of the
veteran and consideration of the factors set forth in subdivisions (4)(a)(i),
(ii), and (iii) of this section, that entry of judgment of conviction should
not be deferred. The fact that a veteran has previously absconded from or
violated pretrial release, probation, parole, supervised release, post-release
supervision, or another form of court-ordered supervision, including a
violation arising from commission of a new offense or an offense committed
while previously participating in a veteran justice program, is not, standing
alone, a sufficient basis to overcome the presumption.
(c) The presumption provided for in subdivision (4)(b) of this section
-22-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
does not apply to a veteran charged with:
(i) A violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, or a city or village
ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, following a
previous conviction for a violation of any such section or ordinance; or
(ii) An offense that resulted in serious bodily injury to another person.
(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections 29-2293 and
29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant to a deferred
judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation Administration Act and
sections 29-2270 to 29-2273.
(6) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an opportunity
to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated a condition of his
or her probation, the court may enter any order authorized by section 29-2268
or pronounce judgment and impose such new sentence as might have been
originally imposed for the offense for which the defendant was convicted.
(7) Upon satisfactory completion of the conditions of probation and the
payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed under
section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to withdraw any
plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action without entry of
judgment. The court shall not grant such motion until a victim of the offense
has received notice and the opportunity to be heard, as required by subsection
(4) of section 29-4804.
(8) Sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 apply to offenses committed on or after
July 1, 2027 2025. For purposes of this subsection, an offense shall be deemed
to have been committed prior to July 1, 2027 2025, if any element of the
offense occurred prior to such date.

participate in a veteran justice program, including completion status,
recidivism, and housing and employment status.

ethnicity, gender, age, military discharge characterization, and the offense
involved.
(4) On or before July 1, 2028 2026, and on or before each July 1
thereafter, the State Court Administrator shall electronically submit a report

identified data collected pursuant to this section and shall analyze the
outcomes, successes, and areas for improvement of the veteran justice programs

order or bring a civil action in the district court for the district where such

written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, requiring the person,
employer, labor organization, or employment agency named in the complaint,
hereinafter referred to as respondent, to answer such charges at a hearing
before the commission at a time and place which shall be specified in such
notice. Such hearing shall be within the county where the alleged unlawful

introduce witnesses at the hearing. The respondent may file a verified answer

and with or without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by
either party. All evidence shall be under oath and a record thereof shall be
made and preserved. Such proceedings shall, so far as practicable, be conducted
in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of
the State of Nebraska, and shall be of public record.
(2) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any book,
document, paper, or account in any investigation, or inquiry by, or hearing
before the commission when ordered to do so, upon the ground that the testimony
or evidence, book, document, paper, or account required of such person may tend
to incriminate such person in or subject such person to penalty or forfeiture;
but no person shall be prosecuted, punished, or subjected to any forfeiture or
penalty for or on account of any act, transaction, matter, or thing concerning
which such person shall have been compelled under oath to testify or produce
documentary evidence, except that no person so testifying shall be exempt from
prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by such person in his or
her testimony. Such immunity shall extend only to a natural person who, in
obedience to a subpoena, gives testimony under oath or produces evidence,
documentary or otherwise, under oath. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed as precluding any person from claiming any right or privilege
available to such person under the Fifth Amendment fifth amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.

days of the receipt of the transcript or the receipt of the recommendations

to the page and line numbers of the transcript when making his or her
recommendation to the commission. Such findings of fact and conclusions of law
shall be in sufficient detail to enable a court on appeal to determine the
controverted questions presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight
was given to the evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent
an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful
employment practice and order such other affirmative action as may be
appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to, reinstatement or
hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay liability shall not
accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of the charge with
the commission. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence
by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the
backpay otherwise allowable.
(4) A complainant who has suffered physical, emotional, or financial harm
as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any stage of
the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in the district
court of the county where such alleged violation occurred. If the complainant
files a district court action on the charge, the complainant shall provide
written notice of such filing to the commission, and such notification shall
immediately terminate all proceedings before the commission. The district court
shall file and try such case as any other civil action, and any successful
complainant shall be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or
permanent injunctive relief, general and special damages, reasonable attorney's
fees, and costs.
(5) No order of the commission shall require the admission or
reinstatement of an individual as a member of a labor organization or the
hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or the
payment to him or her of any backpay, if such individual was refused admission,
suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or advancement or was
suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of
race, color, religion, sex, disability, marital status, or national origin, or
military or veteran status or in violation of section 48-1114. If the
commission finds that a respondent has not engaged in any unfair employment
practice, it shall within thirty days state its findings of fact and
conclusions of law. A copy of any order shall be served upon the person against
whom it runs or his or her attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the
other parties to the proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take
effect twenty days after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall
continue in force either for a period which may be designated therein or until
changed or revoked by the commission.
(6) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, until a
transcript of the record of the proceedings is filed in the district court as
provided in section 48-1120, the commission may, at any time upon reasonable
notice and in such a manner it shall deem proper, modify or set aside, in whole
or in part, any finding or order made by it.

to read:

withheld, and restored by the chief executive officer of the facility with the
approval of the director after the offender has been notified regarding the
charges of misconduct.

(6)(a) Within thirty days after any committed offender has been paroled,
all available information regarding such parolee shall be reviewed and a case
plan document shall be drawn up and approved by the department Division of

plan and the specific goals the department division expects the parolee to
achieve. The document shall also contain a realistic schedule for completion of
the approved case plan. The approved case plan shall be developed with the

program. Any modification shall be made only after notice is given to the
parolee. Intentional failure to comply with the approved case plan by any
parolee as scheduled for any year, or pro rata part thereof, shall cause
disciplinary action to be taken by the department division resulting in the
forfeiture of up to a maximum of three months' good time for the scheduled
year.

whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that such payment
would constitute an undue hardship on the parolee due to limited income,
employment or school status, or physical or mental handicap. Such waiver shall
be in effect only during the period of time that the parolee is unable to pay
his or her monthly parole programming fee.
(4) When monthly parole programming fees are waived, in whole or in part,
the parole officer, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the board, may
contract with the parolee to perform approved community service at the rate of

parolee may be required to pay a participation fee in order to take advantage
-63-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
of community service programs. A parolee may not accumulate more than three
months' advance credit for community service. The use of community service
alternatives does not preclude the imposition of other intermediate measures.
(5) The department, division with the approval of the Board of Parole,
shall implement sanctions if a parolee defaults in the payment of monthly
parole programming fees or any installment thereof as established by subsection
(2) of this section, except that parole shall not be revoked nor shall the
parolee be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the parolee is financially unable
to make the payment.
(6) If the board determines that the default in payment described in
subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate refusal to
obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's part to make a good
faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment, the board may allow the
parolee additional time for payment, reduce the amount of each installment, or
revoke the fees or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.

programming fee per month.

(c) Impose a custodial sanction of up to thirty days in a correctional
facility or a contract facility;
(d) Revoke his or her parole in accordance with the Nebraska Treatment and

-65-

parolee will attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place lives or property
in danger, the parole officer shall arrest the parolee without a warrant and
call on any peace officer to assist him or her in doing so.
(6) Whenever a parolee is arrested with or without a warrant, he or she
shall be detained in a local jail or other detention facility operated by the
department Department of Correctional Services pending completion of review of
parole proceedings by the Board of Parole. Immediately after such arrest and
detention, the parole officer shall notify the Board of Parole and submit a
written report of the reason for such arrest. A complete investigation shall be
made by the department Division of Parole Supervision and submitted to the
board. After prompt consideration of such written report, the board shall order
the parolee's release from detention or continued confinement to await a final
decision on imposition of a custodial sanction or the revocation of parole.
(7) The Board of Parole shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
necessary to carry out this section.
Sec. 154. Section 83-1,122.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
83-1,122.02 (1) The department Division of Parole Supervision shall create
a pilot program to establish a technical parole violation residential housing
program. The purpose of the program is to provide accountability and intensive
support for individuals on parole who commit technical violations, without
revoking them fully back to prison.
(2) The program shall provide a structured environment for selected
individuals on parole who have committed technical violations. The program
shall be based upon a therapeutic community model. Participants in the program
shall, at a minimum, be required to take part in counseling, educational, and
other programs as the department Division of Parole Supervision deems
appropriate, to provide community service, and to submit to drug and alcohol
screening.
(3) An individual on parole shall not be placed in the pilot program until
the department Division of Parole Supervision has determined the individual is
a suitable candidate in accordance with policies and guidelines developed by
the division.
(4) On or before June 1, 2024, the Division of Parole Supervision shall
electronically submit a report to the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature
regarding the pilot program. The report shall evaluate effects of the pilot
program on recidivism and make recommendations regarding expansion of or
changes to the program.
(4) (5) For purposes of this section, technical violation has the same
meaning as in section 83-1,119.
Sec. 155. Section 83-1,125, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
83-1,125 (1) If a warrant or detainer is placed against a committed
offender by a court, parole agency, or other authority of this or any other
jurisdiction, the director Director of Supervision and Services shall inquire
before such offender becomes eligible for parole whether the authority
concerned intends to execute or withdraw the warrant or detainer when the
offender is released.
(2) If the authority notifies the director Director of Supervision and
Services that it intends to execute the warrant or detainer when the offender
is released, the director Director of Supervision and Services shall advise the
authority concerned of the sentence under which the offender is held, the time
of parole eligibility, any decision of the board relating to the offender, and
the nature of the offender's adjustment during imprisonment and shall give
reasonable notice to such authority of the offender's release date.
(3) The board may parole an offender who is eligible for release to a
warrant or detainer. If an offender is paroled to such a warrant or detainer,
the board may provide, as a condition of release, that if the charge or charges
on which the warrant or detainer is based are dismissed, or are satisfied after
conviction and sentence, prior to the expiration of the offender's parole term,
the authority to whose warrant or detainer the offender is released shall
return the offender to serve the remainder of the parole term or such part as
the board may determine.
(4) If a person paroled to a warrant or detainer is thereafter sentenced
and placed on probation, or released on parole in another jurisdiction, prior
to the expiration of the parole term less good time in this state, the board
may permit the person to serve the remainder of the parole term or such part as
the board may determine concurrently with the person's new probation or parole
term. Such concurrent terms may be served in either of the two jurisdictions,
and supervision shall be administered in accordance with the Interstate Compact
for Adult Offender Supervision.
Sec. 156. Section 83-1,125.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
83-1,125.01 (1) The Board of Parole and the department Division of Parole
Supervision may maintain an individual file for each person who is under the
jurisdiction of the Board of Parole. Such file may be maintained electronically
and shall include, when available and appropriate, the following information on
such person:
(a) Admission summary;
(b) Presentence investigation report;
(c) Classification reports and recommendations;
(d) Official records of conviction and commitment along with any earlier
criminal records;
-66-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
(e) Progress reports and admission-orientation reports;
(f) Reports of any disciplinary infractions and their disposition;
(g) Risk and needs assessments;
(h) Parole plan and parole placement and investigation worksheets;
(i) Decision guideline scores;
(j) Parole case plan;
(k) Parole progress reports and contact notes;
(l) Arrest and violation reports, including disposition;
(m) Parole proceedings orders and notices;
(n) Other documents related to parole supervision;
(o) Correspondence; and
(p) Other pertinent data concerning his or her background, conduct,
associations, and family relationships.
(2) Any decision concerning release on or revocation of parole or
imposition of sanctions shall be made only after the individual file has been
reviewed. The contents of the individual file shall be confidential unless
disclosed in connection with a public hearing and shall not be subject to
public inspection except by court order for good cause shown. The contents of
the file shall not be accessible to any person under the jurisdiction of the
Board of Parole. A person under the jurisdiction of the board may obtain access
to his or her medical records by request to the provider pursuant to sections
71-8401 to 71-8407 notwithstanding the fact that such medical records may be a
part of his or her parole file. The board and the department Division of Parole
Supervision have the authority to withhold decision guideline scores, risk and
needs assessment scores, and mental health and psychological records of a
person under the jurisdiction of the board when appropriate.
(3) Nothing in this section limits in any manner the authority of the
Public Counsel to inspect and examine the records and documents of the board
and the department Division of Parole Supervision pursuant to sections 81-8,240
to 81-8,254, except that the Public Counsel's access to the medical or mental
health records of a person under the jurisdiction of the board shall be subject
to his or her consent. The office of Public Counsel shall not disclose the
medical or mental health records of a person under the jurisdiction of the
board to anyone else, including any other person under the jurisdiction of the
board, except as authorized by law.
(4) For any person under the jurisdiction of the Board of Parole, the
board shall provide such person's (a) name, (b) parole officer, and (c)
conditions of parole to the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
Justice which shall provide access to such information to law enforcement
agencies through the state's criminal justice information system.
Sec. 157. Section 83-962, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
83-962 (1) A correctional system overcrowding emergency shall exist
whenever the director certifies that the department's inmate population is over
one hundred forty percent of operational design capacity. The director shall so
certify within thirty days after the date on which the population first exceeds
one hundred forty percent of operational design capacity.
(2) During a correctional system overcrowding emergency, the board shall
immediately consider or reconsider committed offenders eligible for parole who
have not been released on parole.
(3) Upon such consideration or reconsideration, and for all other
consideration of committed offenders eligible for parole while the correctional
system overcrowding emergency is in effect, the board shall order the release
of each committed offender unless it is of the opinion that such release should
be deferred because:
(a) The board has determined that it is more likely than not that the
committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
(b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the
facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a law-
abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed offender
would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on institutional
discipline; or
(c) The board has determined that there is a very substantial risk that
the committed offender will commit a violent act against a person.
(4) In making the determination regarding the risk that a committed
offender will not conform to the conditions of parole, the board shall take
into account the factors set forth in subsection (2) of section 83-1,114 and
shall comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of section 83-1,114 and
section 83-196.01.
(5) The board shall continue granting parole to offenders under this
section until the director certifies that the population is at operational
capacity. The director shall so certify within thirty days after the date on
which the population first reaches operational capacity.
Sec. 158. Sections 50 and 161 of this act become operative October 1,
2025. Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
