AMENDMENTS TO LB150
(Amendments to E and R amendments, ER90)
Introduced by Bosn, 25.
1 1. Strike the original sections and all amendments thereto and
2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
6 (1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current
7 mental health system, including a shortage of mental health care
8 professionals and long travel distances to receive care. These issues
9 have had a negative impact on those suffering from mental health issues
10 and their communities, particularly in rural parts of the state;
11 (2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
12 crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to
13 respond and take the individual into emergency protective custody until
14 the individual can be transported to an available mental health treatment
15 facility. This places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies,
16 particularly in rural parts of the state, which is compounded by the
17 shortage of mental health bed space and long travel distances to
18 facilities;
19 (3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and
20 the state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the
21 negative impact of mental health issues on individuals and law
22 enforcement agencies;
23 (4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
24 communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
25 efficiently and cost-effectively; and
26 (5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of
-1-

LB150 LB150
AJC - 05/27/2025 AJC - 05/27/2025
1 cooperation and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those
2 suffering from mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that
3 interact with them.
4 Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
5 Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
6 provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental
7 health beds and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to
8 service the region.
9 (2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate
10 a method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to
11 address the impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those
12 suffering from mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that
13 can be replicated statewide.
14 (3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency
15 for the pilot program. The selected agency shall:
16 (a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an
17 existing jail facility or elsewhere;
18 (b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement
19 agencies;
20 (c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
21 additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues
22 and law enforcement agencies; and
23 (d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies
24 through a memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds
25 provide a regional benefit.
26 (4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health
27 Expansion Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result
28 in the incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing
29 in the act should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is
30 to expand mental health services provided by law enforcement agencies to
31 individuals temporarily in custody for mental health issues.

6 carry out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.

10 Justice shall coordinate with the Attorney General to carry out the

12 Sec. 6. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
13 Justice shall create a pilot program to seek federal funding for

16 Sec. 7. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
19 villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define,
20 regulate, suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race,
21 color, creed, religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin,
22 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in

2 Discrimination in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice
3 Act, the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and
4 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
5 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
6 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
7 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to
8 those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or resolution may
9 include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages or other
10 equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a petition
11 in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
12 local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
13 equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission
14 or other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and
15 shall have authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to
16 enforce such orders or relief in the district court with appropriate
17 jurisdiction. Certified copies of such ordinances or resolutions shall be
18 transmitted to the commission. When the commission determines that any
19 such city or county has enacted an ordinance or adopted a resolution that
20 is substantially equivalent to such acts and sections or is more
21 comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
22 rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance or
23 resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
24 such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints
25 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
26 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
27 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
28 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
29 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
30 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
31 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
-4-

AJC - 05/27/2025 AJC - 05/27/2025
1 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties
2 or the interests of justice require such action, the commission may
3 regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in the same
4 manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies. In
5 cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
6 subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.
7 (2)(a) Any club which has been issued a license by the Nebraska
8 Liquor Control Commission to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic liquor
9 shall have that license revoked if the club discriminates because of
10 race, color, religion, sex, familial status as defined in section 20-311,
11 disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or national origin, or
12 military or veteran status in the sale, serving, or dispensing of
13 alcoholic liquor to any person who is a guest of a member of such club.

15 53-134.04, 53-1,115, and 53-1,116.
16 (c) This subsection does not prohibit a club from, on an otherwise
17 nondiscriminatory basis, limiting admission or service to veterans or
18 servicemembers or their family members or providing discounts or other
19 benefits to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.
20 Sec. 9. Section 20-132, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 20-132 All persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and
23 equal enjoyment of any place of public accommodation, as defined in
24 sections 20-132 to 20-143, without discrimination or segregation on the
25 grounds of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, or
26 ancestry, or military or veteran status.
27 Sec. 10. Section 20-134, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

5 of sections 20-132 to 20-143.
6 (2) It is not a discriminatory practice under sections 20-132 to

7 2027.
8 Sec. 41. Section 29-4803, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
9 2024, is amended to read:
10 29-4803 (1) The probation administrator shall create a veteran
11 justice program as provided in sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 and subject to
12 the Supreme Court's rules. The program shall be available in every
13 district court and county court. A veteran justice program shall not
14 supersede, alter, or otherwise interfere with the establishment,
15 functioning, participation, or operation of a problem solving court
16 established pursuant to section 24-1302.
17 (2) A veteran justice program shall be operated by use of deferred
18 judgments as provided in this section.
19 (3) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of conviction may
20 be rendered, a defendant that is eligible to participate in a veteran
21 justice program may request the court defer the entry of judgment of
22 conviction under this section. Upon such request, the court shall provide
23 notice to any victim of the offense of the request and provide an
24 opportunity for the victim to provide a statement for consideration by
25 the court. After giving the prosecutor and defendant the opportunity to
26 be heard, the court may defer the entry of a judgment of conviction and
27 the imposition of a sentence and place the defendant on probation, upon
28 conditions as the court may require under sections 29-2262 and 29-4804.
29 If the court defers the entry of judgment, the court shall provide notice
30 to victims of the offense.
31 (4)(a) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment under
-59-

AM1617 AM1617
LB150 LB150
AJC - 05/27/2025 AJC - 05/27/2025
1 this section, the court shall consider the following:
2 (i) The factors set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of section
3 29-2260 and section 29-4802;
4 (ii) The supervision, treatment, and other programming options
5 available in the community; and
6 (iii) Any other information the court deems relevant.
7 (b) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(c) of this section, there
8 shall be a presumption that a veteran eligible under section 29-4802
9 shall be allowed to participate in a veteran justice program. The
10 presumption shall only be overcome by a judicial finding, based on an
11 individualized assessment of the veteran and consideration of the factors
12 set forth in subdivisions (4)(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section,
13 that entry of judgment of conviction should not be deferred. The fact
14 that a veteran has previously absconded from or violated pretrial
15 release, probation, parole, supervised release, post-release supervision,
16 or another form of court-ordered supervision, including a violation
17 arising from commission of a new offense or an offense committed while
18 previously participating in a veteran justice program, is not, standing
19 alone, a sufficient basis to overcome the presumption.
20 (c) The presumption provided for in subdivision (4)(b) of this
21 section does not apply to a veteran charged with:
22 (i) A violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, or a city or
23 village ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or
24 60-6,197, following a previous conviction for a violation of any such
25 section or ordinance; or
26 (ii) An offense that resulted in serious bodily injury to another
27 person.
28 (5) Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections
29 29-2293 and 29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant
30 to a deferred judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation
31 Administration Act and sections 29-2270 to 29-2273.

1 (6) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an
2 opportunity to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated
3 a condition of his or her probation, the court may enter any order
4 authorized by section 29-2268 or pronounce judgment and impose such new
5 sentence as might have been originally imposed for the offense for which
6 the defendant was convicted.
7 (7) Upon satisfactory completion of the conditions of probation and
8 the payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed
9 under section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to
10 withdraw any plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action
11 without entry of judgment. The court shall not grant such motion until a
12 victim of the offense has received notice and the opportunity to be
13 heard, as required by subsection (4) of section 29-4804.
14 (8) Sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 apply to offenses committed on or
15 after July 1, 2027 2025. For purposes of this subsection, an offense

21 on the number of veterans receiving, successfully completing, declining,

23 mitigation described in section 29-4805.
24 (2) The State Court Administrator shall track outcomes among
25 veterans who participate in a veteran justice program, including
26 completion status, recidivism, and housing and employment status.
27 (3) Data collected under this section shall be disaggregated by
28 race, ethnicity, gender, age, military discharge characterization, and
29 the offense involved.
30 (4) On or before July 1, 2028 2026, and on or before each July 1
31 thereafter, the State Court Administrator shall electronically submit a

2 amended to read:
3 43-1414 (1)(a) (1) In any proceeding to establish paternity, the
4 court may, on its own motion, or shall, on a timely request of a party,
5 after notice and hearing, require the child, the mother, and the alleged
6 father to submit to genetic testing to be performed on blood or any other
7 appropriate genetic testing material. Failure to comply with such
8 requirement for genetic testing shall constitute contempt and may be
9 dealt with in the same manner as other contempts. If genetic testing is
10 required, the court shall direct that inherited characteristics be
11 determined by appropriate testing procedures and shall appoint an expert
12 in genetic testing and qualified as an examiner of genetic markers to
13 analyze and interpret the results and to report to the court. The court
14 shall determine the number of experts required.
15 (b) For purposes of this subsection, child means a person under the

28 shall not disclose information obtained from genetic paternity testing
29 that is done pursuant to such sections.

3 national standards under which the laboratory is accredited. If a man is
4 found not to be the child's father, the testing laboratory shall destroy
5 the man's genetic testing material in the presence of a witness after
6 such material is used in the paternity action. The witness may be an
7 individual who is a party to the destruction of the genetic testing
8 material. After the man's genetic testing material is destroyed, the
9 testing laboratory shall make and keep a written record of the
10 destruction and have the individual who witnessed the destruction sign
11 the record. The testing laboratory shall also expunge its records
12 regarding the genetic paternity testing performed on the genetic testing
13 material in accordance with the national standards under which the
14 laboratory is accredited. The testing laboratory shall retain the genetic
15 testing material of the mother and child for no longer than the period of
16 years prescribed by the national standards under which the laboratory is
17 accredited. After a testing laboratory destroys an individual's genetic
18 testing material as provided in this subsection, it shall notify the
19 adult individual, or the parent or legal guardian of a minor individual,
20 by certified mail that the genetic testing material was destroyed.
21 (5) A testing laboratory is required to protect the confidentiality
22 of genetic testing material, except as required for a paternity
23 determination. The court and its officers shall not use or disclose
24 genetic testing material for a purpose other than the paternity
25 determination.
26 (6) A person shall not buy, sell, transfer, or offer genetic testing
27 material obtained under sections 43-1414 to 43-1418.

3 Sec. 59. Section 47-1102, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
4 2024, is amended to read:
5 47-1102 (1) The Legislature finds that studies have shown that post-
6 prison outcomes tend to be better for committed offenders who participate
7 in work release programs prior to discharge from custody. Specifically,
8 findings indicate that committed offenders who participated in work
9 release programs had a higher likelihood of obtaining post-release
10 employment within the first calendar quarter after release and also had a
11 significantly lower rate of recidivism than committed offenders who did
12 not participate in work release programs prior to discharge from custody.
13 In addition, studies indicate that committed offenders who participated
14 in privately operated work release programs were significantly more
15 likely to become employed after release.
16 (2) In light of these findings, and in order to give the Board of
17 Parole and the Department of Correctional Services additional options for
18 the placement of committed offenders, it is the intent of the
19 Legislature:
20 (a) To increase the number of committed offenders in the Nebraska
21 correctional system who are exposed to work release prior to discharge
22 from custody; and
23 (b) To do so in settings that also offer therapy, programming,
24 treatment, vocational training, and educational classes.
25 (3) To achieve these goals, the purpose of the Community Work
26 Release and Reentry Centers Act is to empower the Division of Parole
27 Supervision and the Department of Correctional Services to contract with

18 veteran status, and the policy of this state does not require any
19 employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-

1 the commission any other person whose testimony has a bearing on the
2 matter may be allowed to intervene therein. Both the complainant and the
3 respondent, in addition to the commission, may introduce witnesses at the
4 hearing. The respondent may file a verified answer to the allegations of

6 without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by either
7 party. All evidence shall be under oath and a record thereof shall be
8 made and preserved. Such proceedings shall, so far as practicable, be
9 conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in the

11 (2) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any

14 the testimony or evidence, book, document, paper, or account required of
15 such person may tend to incriminate such person in or subject such person

27 Constitution of the United States.
28 (3) After the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall,
29 within ten days of the receipt of the transcript or the receipt of the

1 hearing officer need not refer to the page and line numbers of the
2 transcript when making his or her recommendation to the commission. Such
3 findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be in sufficient detail to
4 enable a court on appeal to determine the controverted questions
5 presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight was given to the
6 evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
7 intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
8 employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such
9 respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from
10 such unlawful employment practice and order such other affirmative action
11 as may be appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to,
12 reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay
13 liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the
14 filing of the charge with the commission. Interim earnings or amounts
15 earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated
16 against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.
17 (4) A complainant who has suffered physical, emotional, or financial
18 harm as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any
19 stage of the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in
20 the district court of the county where such alleged violation occurred.
21 If the complainant files a district court action on the charge, the
22 complainant shall provide written notice of such filing to the
23 commission, and such notification shall immediately terminate all
24 proceedings before the commission. The district court shall file and try
25 such case as any other civil action, and any successful complainant shall
26 be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or permanent
27 injunctive relief, general and special damages, reasonable attorney's
28 fees, and costs.
29 (5) No order of the commission shall require the admission or
30 reinstatement of an individual as a member of a labor organization or the

4 discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, disability,
5 marital status, or national origin, or military or veteran status or in
6 violation of section 48-1114. If the commission finds that a respondent
7 has not engaged in any unfair employment practice, it shall within thirty
8 days state its findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of any
9 order shall be served upon the person against whom it runs or his or her
10 attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to the
11 proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take effect twenty days
12 after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall continue in
13 force either for a period which may be designated therein or until
14 changed or revoked by the commission.

17 court as provided in section 48-1120, the commission may, at any time
18 upon reasonable notice and in such a manner it shall deem proper, modify

2 second month of parole supervision and continuing for the duration of the
3 parole.
4 (3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming
5 fee in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that
6 such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the parolee due to

9 that the parolee is unable to pay his or her monthly parole programming
10 fee.

21 Parole, shall implement sanctions if a parolee defaults in the payment of
22 monthly parole programming fees or any installment thereof as established
23 by subsection (2) of this section, except that parole shall not be
24 revoked nor shall the parolee be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
25 parolee is financially unable to make the payment.
26 (6) If the board determines that the default in payment described in
27 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
28 refusal to obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's
29 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
30 payment, the board may allow the parolee additional time for payment,
31 reduce the amount of each installment, or revoke the fees or the unpaid

6 lives or property in danger, the parole officer shall arrest the parolee
7 without a warrant and call on any peace officer to assist him or her in
8 doing so.

10 she shall be detained in a local jail or other detention facility
11 operated by the department Department of Correctional Services pending
12 completion of review of parole proceedings by the Board of Parole.

14 notify the Board of Parole and submit a written report of the reason for
15 such arrest. A complete investigation shall be made by the department

23 detainer when the offender is released.
24 (2) If the authority notifies the director Director of Supervision
25 and Services that it intends to execute the warrant or detainer when the
26 offender is released, the director Director of Supervision and Services
27 shall advise the authority concerned of the sentence under which the
28 offender is held, the time of parole eligibility, any decision of the

1 (3) The board may parole an offender who is eligible for release to
2 a warrant or detainer. If an offender is paroled to such a warrant or

6 expiration of the offender's parole term, the authority to whose warrant
7 or detainer the offender is released shall return the offender to serve
8 the remainder of the parole term or such part as the board may determine.
9 (4) If a person paroled to a warrant or detainer is thereafter
10 sentenced and placed on probation, or released on parole in another
11 jurisdiction, prior to the expiration of the parole term less good time
12 in this state, the board may permit the person to serve the remainder of
13 the parole term or such part as the board may determine concurrently with
