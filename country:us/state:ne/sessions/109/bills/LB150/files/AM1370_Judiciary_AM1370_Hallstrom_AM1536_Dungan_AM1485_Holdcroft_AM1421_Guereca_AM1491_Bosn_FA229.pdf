AMENDMENTS TO LB150
Introduced by Judiciary.
1 1. Strike the original sections and insert the following new
2 sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
6 (1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current
7 mental health system, including a shortage of mental health care
8 professionals and long travel distances to receive care. These issues
9 have had a negative impact on those suffering from mental health issues
10 and their communities, particularly in rural parts of the state;
11 (2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
12 crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to
13 respond and take the individual into emergency protective custody until
14 the individual can be transported to an available mental health treatment
15 facility. This places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies,
16 particularly in rural parts of the state, which is compounded by the
17 shortage of mental health bed space and long travel distances to
18 facilities;
19 (3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and
20 the state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the
21 negative impact of mental health issues on individuals and law
22 enforcement agencies;
23 (4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
24 communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
25 efficiently and cost-effectively; and
26 (5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of
27 cooperation and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those

1 suffering from mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that
2 interact with them.
3 Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
4 Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
5 provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental
6 health beds and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to
7 service the region.
8 (2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate
9 a method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to
10 address the impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those
11 suffering from mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that
12 can be replicated statewide.
13 (3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency
14 for the pilot program. The selected agency shall:
15 (a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an
16 existing jail facility or elsewhere;
17 (b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement
18 agencies;
19 (c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
20 additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues
21 and law enforcement agencies; and
22 (d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies
23 through a memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds
24 provide a regional benefit.
25 (4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health
26 Expansion Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result
27 in the incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing
28 in the act should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is
29 to expand mental health services provided by law enforcement agencies to
30 individuals temporarily in custody for mental health issues.
31 Sec. 4. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal

3 application, and audit requirements.
4 (2) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
5 carry out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
6 (3) The commission shall identify grant funding to carry out the
7 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
8 Sec. 5. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
9 Justice shall coordinate with the Attorney General to carry out the
10 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
11 Sec. 6. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
12 Justice shall create a pilot program to seek federal funding for
13 collaborative efforts in emergency response by law enforcement agencies
14 and mental health professionals.

11 findings indicate that committed offenders who participated in work
12 release programs had a higher likelihood of obtaining post-release
13 employment within the first calendar quarter after release and also had a
14 significantly lower rate of recidivism than committed offenders who did
15 not participate in work release programs prior to discharge from custody.
16 In addition, studies indicate that committed offenders who participated
17 in privately operated work release programs were significantly more
18 likely to become employed after release.
19 (2) In light of these findings, and in order to give the Board of
20 Parole and the Department of Correctional Services additional options for
21 the placement of committed offenders, it is the intent of the

5 parolee has violated or is about to violate a condition of parole and
6 that the parolee will attempt to leave the jurisdiction or will place
7 lives or property in danger, the parole officer shall arrest the parolee
8 without a warrant and call on any peace officer to assist him or her in
9 doing so.
10 (6) Whenever a parolee is arrested with or without a warrant, he or
11 she shall be detained in a local jail or other detention facility
12 operated by the department Department of Correctional Services pending
13 completion of review of parole proceedings by the Board of Parole.
14 Immediately after such arrest and detention, the parole officer shall
15 notify the Board of Parole and submit a written report of the reason for
16 such arrest. A complete investigation shall be made by the department
17 Division of Parole Supervision and submitted to the board. After prompt
18 consideration of such written report, the board shall order the parolee's
19 release from detention or continued confinement to await a final decision
20 on imposition of a custodial sanction or the revocation of parole.
21 (7) The Board of Parole shall adopt and promulgate rules and

LB150 LB150
AJC - 05/09/2025 AJC - 05/09/2025
1 program shall be based upon a therapeutic community model. Participants

3 counseling, educational, and other programs as the department Division of
4 Parole Supervision deems appropriate, to provide community service, and
5 to submit to drug and alcohol screening.
6 (3) An individual on parole shall not be placed in the pilot program
7 until the department Division of Parole Supervision has determined the

16 same meaning as in section 83-1,119.
17 Sec. 100. Section 83-1,125, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

20 offender by a court, parole agency, or other authority of this or any
21 other jurisdiction, the director Director of Supervision and Services
22 shall inquire before such offender becomes eligible for parole whether
23 the authority concerned intends to execute or withdraw the warrant or
24 detainer when the offender is released.
25 (2) If the authority notifies the director Director of Supervision
26 and Services that it intends to execute the warrant or detainer when the
27 offender is released, the director Director of Supervision and Services
28 shall advise the authority concerned of the sentence under which the
29 offender is held, the time of parole eligibility, any decision of the
30 board relating to the offender, and the nature of the offender's
31 adjustment during imprisonment and shall give reasonable notice to such
-116-

AM1370 AM1370
LB150 LB150
AJC - 05/09/2025 AJC - 05/09/2025
1 authority of the offender's release date.
2 (3) The board may parole an offender who is eligible for release to
3 a warrant or detainer. If an offender is paroled to such a warrant or
4 detainer, the board may provide, as a condition of release, that if the
5 charge or charges on which the warrant or detainer is based are
6 dismissed, or are satisfied after conviction and sentence, prior to the
7 expiration of the offender's parole term, the authority to whose warrant
8 or detainer the offender is released shall return the offender to serve
9 the remainder of the parole term or such part as the board may determine.
10 (4) If a person paroled to a warrant or detainer is thereafter
11 sentenced and placed on probation, or released on parole in another
12 jurisdiction, prior to the expiration of the parole term less good time
13 in this state, the board may permit the person to serve the remainder of
14 the parole term or such part as the board may determine concurrently with
15 the person's new probation or parole term. Such concurrent terms may be
16 served in either of the two jurisdictions, and supervision shall be
17 administered in accordance with the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender
18 Supervision.
19 Sec. 101. Section 83-1,125.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
20 is amended to read:
21 83-1,125.01 (1) The Board of Parole and the department Division of

15 been reviewed. The contents of the individual file shall be confidential
16 unless disclosed in connection with a public hearing and shall not be
17 subject to public inspection except by court order for good cause shown.
18 The contents of the file shall not be accessible to any person under the
19 jurisdiction of the Board of Parole. A person under the jurisdiction of
20 the board may obtain access to his or her medical records by request to
21 the provider pursuant to sections 71-8401 to 71-8407 notwithstanding the
22 fact that such medical records may be a part of his or her parole file.
23 The board and the department Division of Parole Supervision have the
24 authority to withhold decision guideline scores, risk and needs
25 assessment scores, and mental health and psychological records of a
26 person under the jurisdiction of the board when appropriate.

9 and Criminal Justice which shall provide access to such information to
10 law enforcement agencies through the state's criminal justice information
11 system.

13 amended to read:
14 83-962 (1) A correctional system overcrowding emergency shall exist
15 whenever the director certifies that the department's inmate population
16 is over one hundred forty percent of operational design capacity. The

19 capacity.
20 (2) During a correctional system overcrowding emergency, the board
21 shall immediately consider or reconsider committed offenders eligible for
22 parole who have not been released on parole.
23 (3) Upon such consideration or reconsideration, and for all other
24 consideration of committed offenders eligible for parole while the
25 correctional system overcrowding emergency is in effect, the board shall
26 order the release of each committed offender unless it is of the opinion

28 (a) The board has determined that it is more likely than not that
29 the committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
30 (b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
31 correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in
-119-

AJC - 05/09/2025 AJC - 05/09/2025
1 the facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a
2 law-abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed
3 offender would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on
4 institutional discipline; or
5 (c) The board has determined that there is a very substantial risk
6 that the committed offender will commit a violent act against a person.
7 (4) In making the determination regarding the risk that a committed
8 offender will not conform to the conditions of parole, the board shall
9 take into account the factors set forth in subsection (2) of section
10 83-1,114 and shall comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of
11 section 83-1,114 and section 83-196.01.
12 (5) The board shall continue granting parole to offenders under this
13 section until the director certifies that the population is at
14 operational capacity. The director shall so certify within thirty days
15 after the date on which the population first reaches operational
16 capacity.
