24 physical address of the main chartered office or the office or branch or
25 the agent for service of process designated, and shall be effective upon
26 placement on the department website. The department shall post the list
27 of such designated main chartered offices and offices or branches or
28 agents for service of process on its website for access by the public. A

LB150 LB150
AJC - 05/12/2025 AJC - 05/12/2025

6 to reflect a filing by a financial institution pursuant to this
7 subdivision or a modification or revocation filed by a financial
8 institution pursuant to this subdivision within ten business days
9 following the filing by the financial institution. The department website
10 shall reflect the date its online records for each financial institution
11 have most recently been updated.
12 (b) If a financial institution where deposits are received has
13 designated its main chartered office or one of its offices or branches or
14 its agent for service of process for the service of summons, service made
15 on the main chartered office or the office or branch or the agent for
16 service of process so designated shall be valid and effective as to any
17 property or credits of the defendant in the possession or control of the
18 main chartered office of the financial institution in this state and any
19 of the financial institution offices or branches located within this
20 state. If service of summons is not made on the main chartered office or
21 the office or branch or the agent for service of process designated by
22 the financial institution, but instead is made at another office or
23 branch of the financial institution located in Nebraska, the financial
24 institution, in its discretion, and without violating any obligation to
25 its customer, may elect to treat the service of summons as valid and
26 effective as to any property or credits of the defendant in the
27 possession or control of the main chartered office of the financial
28 institution in this state and any of the financial institution offices or
29 branches located within this state. In the absence of such an election,
30 the financial institution shall file a statement with the interrogatories
31 that the summons was not served at the financial institution's designated

22 described in subsection (6) of this section.

26 accordance with section 25-509.01 or in a manner mutually agreed upon by
27 the garnishee and judgment creditor.
28 (c) If service is not made upon the corporate entity's registered
29 agent for service of process in this state, the judgment creditor shall
30 send a copy of such summons to the location of the corporate entity's
31 registered agent for service of process in this state unless the
