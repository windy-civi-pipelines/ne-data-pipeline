1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current
5 mental health system, including a shortage of mental health care
6 professionals and long travel distances to receive care. These issues
7 have had a negative impact on those suffering from mental health issues
8 and their communities, particularly in rural parts of the state;
9 (2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
10 crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to
11 respond and take the individual into emergency protective custody until
12 the individual can be transported to an available mental health treatment
13 facility. This places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies,
14 particularly in rural parts of the state, which is compounded by the
15 shortage of mental health bed space and long travel distances to
16 facilities;
17 (3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and
18 the state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the
19 negative impact of mental health issues on individuals and law
20 enforcement agencies;
21 (4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
22 communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
23 efficiently and cost-effectively; and
24 (5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of
25 cooperation and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those
26 suffering from mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that
27 interact with them.
28 Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
29 Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
30 provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental
31 health beds and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to
-4-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 service the region.
2 (2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate
3 a method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to
4 address the impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those
5 suffering from mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that
6 can be replicated statewide.
7 (3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency
8 for the pilot program. The selected agency shall:
9 (a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an
10 existing jail facility or elsewhere;
11 (b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement
12 agencies;
13 (c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
14 additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues
15 and law enforcement agencies; and
16 (d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies
17 through a memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds
18 provide a regional benefit.
19 (4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health
20 Expansion Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result
21 in the incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing
22 in the act should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is
23 to expand mental health services provided by law enforcement agencies to
24 individuals temporarily in custody for mental health issues.
25 Sec. 4. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
26 Justice shall administer the pilot program and, in addition to the
27 requirements set out in section 3 of this act, develop grant eligibility,
28 application, and audit requirements.
29 (2) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
30 carry out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
31 (3) The commission shall identify grant funding to carry out the
-5-

2025 2025
1 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
2 Sec. 5. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
3 Justice shall coordinate with the Attorney General to carry out the
4 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
5 Sec. 6. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
6 Justice shall create a pilot program to seek federal funding for
7 collaborative efforts in emergency response by law enforcement agencies
8 and mental health professionals.
9 Sec. 7. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
12 villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define,
13 regulate, suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race,
14 color, creed, religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin,
15 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in
16 section 20-308.01, or age, or military or veteran status in employment,
17 public accommodation, and housing and may provide for the enforcement of
18 such ordinances by providing appropriate penalties for the violation
19 thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment practice to refuse
20 employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses if such policy
21 is equally applied to both sexes.
22 Sec. 8. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county
25 may adopt resolutions which are substantially equivalent to the Age
26 Discrimination in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice
27 Act, the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and
28 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
29 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
30 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
31 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to
-6-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or resolution may
2 include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages or other
3 equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a petition
4 in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
5 local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
6 equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission
7 or other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and
8 shall have authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to
9 enforce such orders or relief in the district court with appropriate
10 jurisdiction. Certified copies of such ordinances or resolutions shall be
11 transmitted to the commission. When the commission determines that any
12 such city or county has enacted an ordinance or adopted a resolution that
13 is substantially equivalent to such acts and sections or is more
14 comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
15 rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance or
16 resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
17 such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints
18 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
19 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
20 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
21 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
22 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
23 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
24 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
25 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties
26 or the interests of justice require such action, the commission may
27 regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in the same
28 manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies. In
29 cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
30 subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.
31 (2)(a) Any club which has been issued a license by the Nebraska
-7-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 Liquor Control Commission to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic liquor
2 shall have that license revoked if the club discriminates because of
3 race, color, religion, sex, familial status as defined in section 20-311,
4 disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or national origin, or
5 military or veteran status in the sale, serving, or dispensing of
6 alcoholic liquor to any person who is a guest of a member of such club.
7 (b) The procedure for revocation shall be as prescribed in sections
8 53-134.04, 53-1,115, and 53-1,116.
9 (c) This subsection does not prohibit a club from, on an otherwise
10 nondiscriminatory basis, limiting admission or service to veterans or
11 servicemembers or their family members or providing discounts or other
12 benefits to veterans or servicemembers or their family members.
13 Sec. 9. Section 20-132, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 20-132 All persons within this state shall be entitled to a full and
16 equal enjoyment of any place of public accommodation, as defined in
17 sections 20-132 to 20-143, without discrimination or segregation on the
18 grounds of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, or
19 ancestry, or military or veteran status.
20 Sec. 10. Section 20-134, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 20-134 (1) Any person who directly or indirectly refuses, withholds
23 from, denies, or attempts to refuse, withhold, or deny, to any other
24 person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, services, or
25 privileges, or who segregates any person in a place of public
26 accommodation on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, religion, national
27 origin, disability, or ancestry, or military or veteran status, shall be
28 guilty of discriminatory practice and shall be subject to the penalties
29 of sections 20-132 to 20-143.
30 (2) It is not a discriminatory practice under sections 20-132 to
31 20-143 for a person or a place of public accommodation to, on an
-8-

4 Sec. 11. Section 20-139, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 20-139 The Nebraska Fair Housing Act and sections 20-123, 20-124,

8 Commission, except that the State Fire Marshal shall administer the act
9 and sections as they relate to accessibility standards and specifications
10 set forth in sections 81-5,147 and 81-5,148. The county attorneys are
11 granted the authority to enforce such act and sections 20-123, 20-124,
12 and 20-132 to 20-143 and shall possess the same powers and duties with
13 respect thereto as the commission. If a complaint is filed with the
14 county attorney, the commission shall be notified. Powers granted to and
15 duties imposed upon the commission pursuant to such act and sections
16 shall be in addition to the provisions of the Nebraska Fair Employment
17 Practice Act and shall not be construed to amend or restrict those
18 provisions. In carrying out the Nebraska Fair Housing Act and sections
19 20-123, 20-124, and 20-132 to 20-143, the commission shall have the power
20 to:
21 (1) Seek to eliminate and prevent discrimination in places of public
22 accommodation because of race, color, sex, religion, national origin,
23 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in

9 payment shall be retained by the garnishee until further order of the
10 court. Thereafter, the service of the summons and interrogatories and all
11 further proceedings shall be in all respects the same as is provided for
12 in sections 25-1011 and 25-1026 to 25-1031.01 unless inconsistent with

17 served, or that earnings would be owed within sixty days thereafter and
18 there is not a successful written objection to the order or the answer of
19 the garnishee filed, on application by the judgment creditor, the court
20 shall order that the nonexempt earnings, if any, withheld by the

23 Except for garnishments in support of a person, the payments may be made
24 payable to the judgment creditor or assignee and shall be forwarded to
25 the issuing court to record the judgment payment prior to the court
26 delivering the payment to the judgment creditor or assignee. The court
27 shall, upon application of the judgment creditor, further order that the
28 garnishment is a continuing lien against the nonexempt earnings of the
29 judgment debtor. An order of continuing lien on nonexempt earnings
30 entered pursuant to this section shall require the garnishee to continue
31 to withhold the nonexempt earnings of the judgment debtor for as long as
-29-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 the continuing lien remains in effect.
2 Beginning with the pay period during which the writ was served and
3 while the continuing lien remains in effect, the garnishee shall deliver
4 the nonexempt earnings to the court from which the garnishment was issued
5 for each pay period or on a monthly basis if the garnishee so desires and
6 shall deliver to the judgment debtor his or her exempt earnings for each
7 pay period.
8 (3) A continuing lien ordered pursuant to this section shall be
9 invalid and shall have no force and effect upon the occurrence of any of

13 (b) The judgment debtor leaves the garnishee's employ for more than

20 (f) The court orders that the garnishment be quashed; or
21 (g) Ninety days have expired since service of the writ. The judgment
22 creditor may extend the lien for a second ninety-day period by filing
23 with the court a notice of extension during the fifteen days immediately
24 prior to the expiration of the initial lien, and the continuing lien in
25 favor of the initial judgment creditor shall continue for a second
26 ninety-day period.
27 (4)(a) To determine priority, garnishments and liens shall rank
28 according to time of service.
29 (b) Garnishments, liens, and wage assignments which are not for the
30 support of a person shall be inferior to wage assignments for the support
31 of a person. Garnishments which are not for the support of a person and
-30-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 liens shall be inferior to garnishments for the support of a person.
2 (5) Only one order of continuing lien against earnings due the
3 judgment debtor shall be in effect at one time. If an employee's wages
4 are already being garnished pursuant to a continuing lien at the time of
5 service of a garnishment upon an employer, the answer to garnishment
6 interrogatories shall include such information along with the date of
7 termination of such continuing lien and the title of the case from which
8 such garnishment is issued. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this
9 section, a continuing lien obtained pursuant to this section shall have
10 priority over any subsequent garnishment or wage assignment.
11 (6)(a) In any case involving service of a garnishment summons on a
12 financial institution where deposits are received within this state, the
13 financial institution shall (i) if its main chartered office is located
14 in this state, designate its main chartered office for the service of
15 summons or (ii) if its main chartered office is located in another state,
16 designate any one of its offices or branches or its agent for service of
17 process in this state for service of summons. The designation of a main
18 chartered office or an office or branch or the agent for service of

21 physical address of the main chartered office or the office or branch or
22 the agent for service of process designated, and shall be effective upon
23 placement on the department website. The department shall post the list
24 of such designated main chartered offices and offices or branches or
25 agents for service of process on its website for access by the public. A
26 financial institution may modify or revoke a designation made under this
27 subdivision by filing the modification or revocation with the department.
28 The modification or revocation shall be effective when the department's
29 website has been updated to reflect the modification or revocation,
30 except that the judgment creditor may rely upon the designation that was
31 modified or revoked during the thirty-day period following the effective
-31-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 date of the modification or revocation if the summons is timely served
2 upon the financial institution. The department shall update its website
3 to reflect a filing by a financial institution pursuant to this
4 subdivision or a modification or revocation filed by a financial
5 institution pursuant to this subdivision within ten business days
6 following the filing by the financial institution. The department website
7 shall reflect the date its online records for each financial institution
8 have most recently been updated.
9 (b) If a financial institution where deposits are received has
10 designated its main chartered office or one of its offices or branches or
11 its agent for service of process for the service of summons, service made
12 on the main chartered office or the office or branch or the agent for
13 service of process so designated shall be valid and effective as to any
14 property or credits of the defendant in the possession or control of the
15 main chartered office of the financial institution in this state and any
16 of the financial institution offices or branches located within this
17 state. If service of summons is not made on the main chartered office or
18 the office or branch or the agent for service of process designated by
19 the financial institution, but instead is made at another office or
20 branch of the financial institution located in Nebraska, the financial
21 institution, in its discretion, and without violating any obligation to
22 its customer, may elect to treat the service of summons as valid and
23 effective as to any property or credits of the defendant in the
24 possession or control of the main chartered office of the financial
25 institution in this state and any of the financial institution offices or
26 branches located within this state. In the absence of such an election,
27 the financial institution shall file a statement with the interrogatories
28 that the summons was not served at the financial institution's designated
29 location for receiving service of summons and, therefore, was not
30 processed, and shall provide the address at which the financial
31 institution is to receive service of summons.

22 other state or by the United States, the court shall sentence such person
23 so convicted as a habitual criminal.

31 Sec. 41. Section 29-4803, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
-61-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 2024, is amended to read:
2 29-4803 (1) The probation administrator shall create a veteran
3 justice program as provided in sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 and subject to
4 the Supreme Court's rules. The program shall be available in every
5 district court and county court. A veteran justice program shall not
6 supersede, alter, or otherwise interfere with the establishment,
7 functioning, participation, or operation of a problem solving court
8 established pursuant to section 24-1302.
9 (2) A veteran justice program shall be operated by use of deferred
10 judgments as provided in this section.
11 (3) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of conviction may
12 be rendered, a defendant that is eligible to participate in a veteran
13 justice program may request the court defer the entry of judgment of
14 conviction under this section. Upon such request, the court shall provide
15 notice to any victim of the offense of the request and provide an
16 opportunity for the victim to provide a statement for consideration by
17 the court. After giving the prosecutor and defendant the opportunity to
18 be heard, the court may defer the entry of a judgment of conviction and
19 the imposition of a sentence and place the defendant on probation, upon
20 conditions as the court may require under sections 29-2262 and 29-4804.
21 If the court defers the entry of judgment, the court shall provide notice
22 to victims of the offense.
23 (4)(a) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment under
24 this section, the court shall consider the following:
25 (i) The factors set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of section
26 29-2260 and section 29-4802;
27 (ii) The supervision, treatment, and other programming options
28 available in the community; and
29 (iii) Any other information the court deems relevant.
30 (b) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(c) of this section, there
31 shall be a presumption that a veteran eligible under section 29-4802
-62-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 shall be allowed to participate in a veteran justice program. The
2 presumption shall only be overcome by a judicial finding, based on an
3 individualized assessment of the veteran and consideration of the factors
4 set forth in subdivisions (4)(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section,
5 that entry of judgment of conviction should not be deferred. The fact
6 that a veteran has previously absconded from or violated pretrial
7 release, probation, parole, supervised release, post-release supervision,
8 or another form of court-ordered supervision, including a violation
9 arising from commission of a new offense or an offense committed while
10 previously participating in a veteran justice program, is not, standing
11 alone, a sufficient basis to overcome the presumption.
12 (c) The presumption provided for in subdivision (4)(b) of this
13 section does not apply to a veteran charged with:
14 (i) A violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, or a city or
15 village ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or
16 60-6,197, following a previous conviction for a violation of any such
17 section or ordinance; or
18 (ii) An offense that resulted in serious bodily injury to another
19 person.
20 (5) Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections
21 29-2293 and 29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant
22 to a deferred judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation
23 Administration Act and sections 29-2270 to 29-2273.
24 (6) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an
25 opportunity to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated
26 a condition of his or her probation, the court may enter any order
27 authorized by section 29-2268 or pronounce judgment and impose such new
28 sentence as might have been originally imposed for the offense for which
29 the defendant was convicted.
30 (7) Upon satisfactory completion of the conditions of probation and
31 the payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed
-63-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 under section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to
2 withdraw any plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action
3 without entry of judgment. The court shall not grant such motion until a
4 victim of the offense has received notice and the opportunity to be
5 heard, as required by subsection (4) of section 29-4804.
6 (8) Sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 apply to offenses committed on or
7 after July 1, 2027 2025. For purposes of this subsection, an offense
8 shall be deemed to have been committed prior to July 1, 2027 2025, if any
9 element of the offense occurred prior to such date.
10 Sec. 42. Section 29-4807, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
11 2024, is amended to read:
12 29-4807 (1) The State Court Administrator shall compile information
13 on the number of veterans receiving, successfully completing, declining,
14 and denied participation in a veteran justice program and the sentencing
15 mitigation described in section 29-4805.
16 (2) The State Court Administrator shall track outcomes among
17 veterans who participate in a veteran justice program, including
18 completion status, recidivism, and housing and employment status.
19 (3) Data collected under this section shall be disaggregated by
20 race, ethnicity, gender, age, military discharge characterization, and
21 the offense involved.
22 (4) On or before July 1, 2028 2026, and on or before each July 1
23 thereafter, the State Court Administrator shall electronically submit a
24 report to the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature. The report shall
25 contain de-identified data collected pursuant to this section and shall
26 analyze the outcomes, successes, and areas for improvement of the veteran
27 justice programs and the sentencing mitigation described in section
28 29-4805.

29 prison outcomes tend to be better for committed offenders who participate
30 in work release programs prior to discharge from custody. Specifically,
31 findings indicate that committed offenders who participated in work
-84-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 release programs had a higher likelihood of obtaining post-release
2 employment within the first calendar quarter after release and also had a
3 significantly lower rate of recidivism than committed offenders who did
4 not participate in work release programs prior to discharge from custody.
5 In addition, studies indicate that committed offenders who participated
6 in privately operated work release programs were significantly more
7 likely to become employed after release.
8 (2) In light of these findings, and in order to give the Board of
9 Parole and the Department of Correctional Services additional options for
10 the placement of committed offenders, it is the intent of the

19 Supervision and the Department of Correctional Services to contract with
20 private providers to establish community work release and reentry centers
21 at various locations throughout the State of Nebraska.

7 electronic copy of the report required by this subdivision by making a
8 request for it to the chairperson of the commission; and
9 (7) To adopt and promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry
10 out the duties prescribed in the act.
11 Sec. 88. Section 48-1119, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 48-1119 (1) In case of failure to eliminate any unlawful employment
14 practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, persuasion,
15 mediation, or arbitration, the commission may order a public hearing. If
16 such hearing is ordered, the commission shall cause to be issued and
17 served a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, requiring
18 the person, employer, labor organization, or employment agency named in
19 the complaint, hereinafter referred to as respondent, to answer such
20 charges at a hearing before the commission at a time and place which
21 shall be specified in such notice. Such hearing shall be within the
22 county where the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. The
23 complainant shall be a party to the proceeding, and in the discretion of
24 the commission any other person whose testimony has a bearing on the
25 matter may be allowed to intervene therein. Both the complainant and the
26 respondent, in addition to the commission, may introduce witnesses at the
27 hearing. The respondent may file a verified answer to the allegations of
28 the complaint and may appear at such hearing in person and with or
29 without counsel. Testimony or other evidence may be introduced by either
30 party. All evidence shall be under oath and a record thereof shall be

-108-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025

2 district courts of the State of Nebraska, and shall be of public record.
3 (2) No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any
4 book, document, paper, or account in any investigation, or inquiry by, or
5 hearing before the commission when ordered to do so, upon the ground that
6 the testimony or evidence, book, document, paper, or account required of
7 such person may tend to incriminate such person in or subject such person
8 to penalty or forfeiture; but no person shall be prosecuted, punished, or
9 subjected to any forfeiture or penalty for or on account of any act,
10 transaction, matter, or thing concerning which such person shall have
11 been compelled under oath to testify or produce documentary evidence,
12 except that no person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or
13 punishment for any perjury committed by such person in his or her
14 testimony. Such immunity shall extend only to a natural person who, in
15 obedience to a subpoena, gives testimony under oath or produces evidence,

18 available to such person under the Fifth Amendment fifth amendment to the
19 Constitution of the United States.
20 (3) After the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall,
21 within ten days of the receipt of the transcript or the receipt of the

23 fact and conclusions of law and make and enter an appropriate order. The
24 hearing officer need not refer to the page and line numbers of the
25 transcript when making his or her recommendation to the commission. Such
26 findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be in sufficient detail to
27 enable a court on appeal to determine the controverted questions
28 presented by the proceedings and whether proper weight was given to the
29 evidence. If the commission determines that the respondent has
30 intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in any unlawful
31 employment practice, it shall issue and cause to be served on such
-109-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from
2 such unlawful employment practice and order such other affirmative action
3 as may be appropriate which may include, but shall not be limited to,
4 reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay. Backpay
5 liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the
6 filing of the charge with the commission. Interim earnings or amounts
7 earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated
8 against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.
9 (4) A complainant who has suffered physical, emotional, or financial
10 harm as a result of a violation of section 48-1104 or 48-1114 may, at any
11 stage of the proceedings prior to dismissal, file an action directly in
12 the district court of the county where such alleged violation occurred.
13 If the complainant files a district court action on the charge, the
14 complainant shall provide written notice of such filing to the
15 commission, and such notification shall immediately terminate all
16 proceedings before the commission. The district court shall file and try
17 such case as any other civil action, and any successful complainant shall
18 be entitled to appropriate relief, including temporary or permanent
19 injunctive relief, general and special damages, reasonable attorney's
20 fees, and costs.
21 (5) No order of the commission shall require the admission or
22 reinstatement of an individual as a member of a labor organization or the
23 hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or
24 the payment to him or her of any backpay, if such individual was refused
25 admission, suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or
26 advancement or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than
27 discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, disability,
28 marital status, or national origin, or military or veteran status or in
29 violation of section 48-1114. If the commission finds that a respondent
30 has not engaged in any unfair employment practice, it shall within thirty
31 days state its findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of any
-110-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 order shall be served upon the person against whom it runs or his or her
2 attorney and notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to the
3 proceedings or their attorneys. Such order shall take effect twenty days
4 after service thereof unless otherwise provided and shall continue in
5 force either for a period which may be designated therein or until
6 changed or revoked by the commission.
7 (6) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, until a
8 transcript of the record of the proceedings is filed in the district
9 court as provided in section 48-1120, the commission may, at any time
10 upon reasonable notice and in such a manner it shall deem proper, modify
11 or set aside, in whole or in part, any finding or order made by it.

26 notice is given to the parolee. Intentional failure to comply with the
27 approved case plan by any parolee as scheduled for any year, or pro rata
28 part thereof, shall cause disciplinary action to be taken by the
29 department division resulting in the forfeiture of up to a maximum of
30 three months' good time for the scheduled year.

-178-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025

23 Parole Supervision shall pay a monthly parole programming fee of twenty-
24 five dollars, not later than the tenth day of each month, beginning the
25 second month of parole supervision and continuing for the duration of the
26 parole.
27 (3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming
28 fee in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that
29 such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the parolee due to
30 limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental
31 handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time
-179-
LB150 LB150

19 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
20 refusal to obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's
21 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
22 payment, the board may allow the parolee additional time for payment,
23 reduce the amount of each installment, or revoke the fees or the unpaid
24 portion in whole or in part.
25 (7) No parolee shall be required to pay more than one monthly parole
26 programming fee per month.
27 (8) The imposition of monthly parole programming fees in this

1 (o) Correspondence; and
2 (p) Other pertinent data concerning his or her background, conduct,
3 associations, and family relationships.
4 (2) Any decision concerning release on or revocation of parole or
5 imposition of sanctions shall be made only after the individual file has
6 been reviewed. The contents of the individual file shall be confidential
7 unless disclosed in connection with a public hearing and shall not be
8 subject to public inspection except by court order for good cause shown.
9 The contents of the file shall not be accessible to any person under the
10 jurisdiction of the Board of Parole. A person under the jurisdiction of
11 the board may obtain access to his or her medical records by request to
12 the provider pursuant to sections 71-8401 to 71-8407 notwithstanding the
13 fact that such medical records may be a part of his or her parole file.
14 The board and the department Division of Parole Supervision have the
15 authority to withhold decision guideline scores, risk and needs
16 assessment scores, and mental health and psychological records of a
17 person under the jurisdiction of the board when appropriate.
18 (3) Nothing in this section limits in any manner the authority of
19 the Public Counsel to inspect and examine the records and documents of
20 the board and the department Division of Parole Supervision pursuant to
21 sections 81-8,240 to 81-8,254, except that the Public Counsel's access to
22 the medical or mental health records of a person under the jurisdiction
23 of the board shall be subject to his or her consent. The office of Public
24 Counsel shall not disclose the medical or mental health records of a
25 person under the jurisdiction of the board to anyone else, including any
26 other person under the jurisdiction of the board, except as authorized by
27 law.
28 (4) For any person under the jurisdiction of the Board of Parole,
29 the board shall provide such person's (a) name, (b) parole officer, and
30 (c) conditions of parole to the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement
31 and Criminal Justice which shall provide access to such information to

3 Sec. 157. Section 83-962, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 83-962 (1) A correctional system overcrowding emergency shall exist
6 whenever the director certifies that the department's inmate population
7 is over one hundred forty percent of operational design capacity. The
8 director shall so certify within thirty days after the date on which the
9 population first exceeds one hundred forty percent of operational design
10 capacity.
11 (2) During a correctional system overcrowding emergency, the board
12 shall immediately consider or reconsider committed offenders eligible for
13 parole who have not been released on parole.
14 (3) Upon such consideration or reconsideration, and for all other
15 consideration of committed offenders eligible for parole while the
16 correctional system overcrowding emergency is in effect, the board shall
17 order the release of each committed offender unless it is of the opinion
18 that such release should be deferred because:
19 (a) The board has determined that it is more likely than not that
20 the committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
21 (b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
22 correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in
23 the facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a
24 law-abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed
25 offender would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on
26 institutional discipline; or
27 (c) The board has determined that there is a very substantial risk
28 that the committed offender will commit a violent act against a person.
29 (4) In making the determination regarding the risk that a committed
30 offender will not conform to the conditions of parole, the board shall
31 take into account the factors set forth in subsection (2) of section
-190-
LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 83-1,114 and shall comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of
2 section 83-1,114 and section 83-196.01.
3 (5) The board shall continue granting parole to offenders under this
4 section until the director certifies that the population is at
5 operational capacity. The director shall so certify within thirty days
6 after the date on which the population first reaches operational
7 capacity.

2025 2025
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 5 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (1) The State of Nebraska is facing serious issues in its current
5 mental health system, including a shortage of mental health care
6 professionals and long travel distances to receive care. These issues
7 have had a negative impact on those suffering from mental health issues
8 and their communities, particularly in rural parts of the state;
9 (2) As a consequence, when an individual experiences a mental health
10 crisis in public, law enforcement officers are frequently required to
11 respond and take the individual into emergency protective custody until
12 the individual can be transported to an available mental health treatment
13 facility. This places a significant burden on law enforcement agencies,
14 particularly in rural parts of the state, which is compounded by the
15 shortage of mental health bed space and long travel distances to
16 facilities;
17 (3) Addressing these issues is vitally important to the state, and
18 the state would benefit from innovative solutions aimed at reducing the
19 negative impact of mental health issues on individuals and law
20 enforcement agencies;
21 (4) There is a history of cooperation between rural agencies and
22 communities that have successfully worked together to meet regional needs
23 efficiently and cost-effectively; and
24 (5) There is an opportunity to adapt the existing method of
25 cooperation and apply it in a way that helps reduce the impact on those
26 suffering from mental health issues and the law enforcement agencies that
27 interact with them.
28 Sec. 3. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
29 Justice shall create a regional mental health expansion pilot program to
30 provide funding to a county law enforcement agency to expand mental
31 health beds and encourage cooperation between law enforcement agencies to
-4-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 service the region.
2 (2) The Legislature intends that the pilot program will demonstrate
3 a method of regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies to
4 address the impact of shortages and the long travel distances on those
5 suffering from mental health issues and law enforcement agencies and that
6 can be replicated statewide.
7 (3) The commission shall select one county law enforcement agency
8 for the pilot program. The selected agency shall:
9 (a) Have the capacity to add mental health beds, either at an
10 existing jail facility or elsewhere;
11 (b) Have a history of cooperation with other law enforcement
12 agencies;
13 (c) Provide an assessment of the anticipated regional impact of the
14 additional mental health beds on individuals with mental health issues
15 and law enforcement agencies; and
16 (d) Cooperate with other counties or law enforcement agencies
17 through a memorandum of understanding to ensure the mental health beds
18 provide a regional benefit.
19 (4) The Legislature does not intend the Regional Mental Health
20 Expansion Pilot Program Act to criminalize mental health issues or result
21 in the incarceration of individuals for mental health issues, and nothing
22 in the act should be so construed. The purpose of this pilot program is
23 to expand mental health services provided by law enforcement agencies to
24 individuals temporarily in custody for mental health issues.
25 Sec. 4. (1) The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
26 Justice shall administer the pilot program and, in addition to the
27 requirements set out in section 3 of this act, develop grant eligibility,
28 application, and audit requirements.
29 (2) The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
30 carry out the Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
31 (3) The commission shall identify grant funding to carry out the
-5-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
2 Sec. 5. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
3 Justice shall coordinate with the Attorney General to carry out the
4 Regional Mental Health Expansion Pilot Program Act.
5 Sec. 6. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
6 Justice shall create a pilot program to seek federal funding for
7 collaborative efforts in emergency response by law enforcement agencies
8 and mental health professionals.
9 Sec. 7. Section 18-1724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 18-1724 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all cities and
12 villages in this state shall have the power by ordinance to define,
13 regulate, suppress, and prevent discrimination on the basis of race,
14 color, creed, religion, ancestry, sex, marital status, national origin,
15 familial status as defined in section 20-311, disability as defined in
16 section 20-308.01, or age, or military or veteran status in employment,
17 public accommodation, and housing and may provide for the enforcement of
18 such ordinances by providing appropriate penalties for the violation
19 thereof. It shall not be an unlawful employment practice to refuse
20 employment based on a policy of not employing both spouses if such policy
21 is equally applied to both sexes.
22 Sec. 8. Section 20-113, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 20-113 (1) Any incorporated city may enact ordinances and any county
25 may adopt resolutions which are substantially equivalent to the Age
26 Discrimination in Employment Act, the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice
27 Act, the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, and sections 20-126 to 20-143 and
28 48-1219 to 48-1227 or which are more comprehensive than such acts and
29 sections in the protection of civil rights. No such ordinance or
30 resolution shall place a duty or liability on any person, other than an
31 employer, employment agency, or labor organization, for acts similar to
-6-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 those prohibited by section 48-1115. Such ordinance or resolution may
2 include authority for a local agency to seek an award of damages or other
3 equitable relief on behalf of the complainant by the filing of a petition
4 in the district court in the county with appropriate jurisdiction. The
5 local agency shall have within its authority jurisdiction substantially
6 equivalent to or more comprehensive than the Equal Opportunity Commission
7 or other enforcement agencies provided under such acts and sections and
8 shall have authority to order backpay and other equitable relief or to
9 enforce such orders or relief in the district court with appropriate
10 jurisdiction. Certified copies of such ordinances or resolutions shall be
11 transmitted to the commission. When the commission determines that any
12 such city or county has enacted an ordinance or adopted a resolution that
13 is substantially equivalent to such acts and sections or is more
14 comprehensive than such acts and sections in the protection of civil
15 rights and has established a local agency to administer such ordinance or
16 resolution, the commission may thereafter refer all complaints arising in
17 such city or county to the appropriate local agency. All complaints
18 arising within a city shall be referred to the appropriate agency in such
19 city when both the city and the county in which the city is located have
20 established agencies pursuant to this section. When the commission refers
21 a complaint to a local agency, it shall take no further action on such
22 complaint if the local agency proceeds promptly to handle such complaint
23 pursuant to the local ordinance or resolution. If the commission
24 determines that a local agency is not handling a complaint with
25 reasonable promptness or that the protection of the rights of the parties
26 or the interests of justice require such action, the commission may
27 regain jurisdiction of the complaint and proceed to handle it in the same
28 manner as other complaints which are not referred to local agencies. In
29 cases of conflict between this section and section 20-332, for complaints
30 subject to the Nebraska Fair Housing Act, section 20-332 shall control.
31 (2)(a) Any club which has been issued a license by the Nebraska
-7-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 Liquor Control Commission to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic liquor
2 shall have that license revoked if the club discriminates because of
3 race, color, religion, sex, familial status as defined in section 20-311,
4 disability as defined in section 20-308.01, or national origin, or
5 military or veteran status in the sale, serving, or dispensing of
6 alcoholic liquor to any person who is a guest of a member of such club.

25 the issuing court to record the judgment payment prior to the court
26 delivering the payment to the judgment creditor or assignee. The court

6 shall deliver to the judgment debtor his or her exempt earnings for each
7 pay period.

23 with the court a notice of extension during the fifteen days immediately
24 prior to the expiration of the initial lien, and the continuing lien in
25 favor of the initial judgment creditor shall continue for a second
26 ninety-day period.
27 (4)(a) To determine priority, garnishments and liens shall rank
28 according to time of service.

12 financial institution where deposits are received within this state, the
13 financial institution shall (i) if its main chartered office is located
14 in this state, designate its main chartered office for the service of
15 summons or (ii) if its main chartered office is located in another state,

19 process under this subdivision shall be made by filing a notice of
20 designation with the Department of Banking and Finance, shall contain the

23 placement on the department website. The department shall post the list
24 of such designated main chartered offices and offices or branches or
25 agents for service of process on its website for access by the public. A
26 financial institution may modify or revoke a designation made under this
27 subdivision by filing the modification or revocation with the department.
28 The modification or revocation shall be effective when the department's
29 website has been updated to reflect the modification or revocation,
30 except that the judgment creditor may rely upon the designation that was
31 modified or revoked during the thirty-day period following the effective
-31-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 date of the modification or revocation if the summons is timely served
2 upon the financial institution. The department shall update its website
3 to reflect a filing by a financial institution pursuant to this

5 institution pursuant to this subdivision within ten business days
6 following the filing by the financial institution. The department website

8 have most recently been updated.
9 (b) If a financial institution where deposits are received has
10 designated its main chartered office or one of its offices or branches or
11 its agent for service of process for the service of summons, service made
12 on the main chartered office or the office or branch or the agent for
13 service of process so designated shall be valid and effective as to any
14 property or credits of the defendant in the possession or control of the
15 main chartered office of the financial institution in this state and any
16 of the financial institution offices or branches located within this
17 state. If service of summons is not made on the main chartered office or
18 the office or branch or the agent for service of process designated by
19 the financial institution, but instead is made at another office or
20 branch of the financial institution located in Nebraska, the financial
21 institution, in its discretion, and without violating any obligation to
22 its customer, may elect to treat the service of summons as valid and
23 effective as to any property or credits of the defendant in the
24 possession or control of the main chartered office of the financial
25 institution in this state and any of the financial institution offices or
26 branches located within this state. In the absence of such an election,
27 the financial institution shall file a statement with the interrogatories
28 that the summons was not served at the financial institution's designated
29 location for receiving service of summons and, therefore, was not
30 processed, and shall provide the address at which the financial

8 investigation of the offender and according due consideration to a
9 written report of such investigation. When an offender has been convicted

26 and mental condition, family situation and background, economic status,

28 the probation officer deems relevant or the court directs to be included.
29 All local and state police agencies and Department of Correctional
30 Services adult correctional facilities shall furnish to the probation
31 officer copies of such criminal records, in any such case referred to the

4 (a) Any written statements submitted to the county attorney by a
5 victim; and

9 officer, he or she shall certify to the court that:
10 (a) He or she has attempted to contact the victim; and
11 (b) If he or she has contacted the victim, such officer offered to
12 accept the written statements of the victim or to reduce such victim's
13 oral statements to writing.
14 For purposes of subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the term
15 victim shall be as defined in section 29-119.
16 (5) Before imposing sentence, the court may order the offender to
17 submit to psychiatric observation and examination for a period of not
18 exceeding sixty days or such longer period as the court determines to be
19 necessary for that purpose. The offender may be remanded for this purpose
20 to any available clinic or mental hospital, or the court may appoint a
21 qualified psychiatrist to make the examination. The report of the
22 examination shall be submitted to the court.
23 (6)(a) Any presentence report, substance abuse evaluation, or
24 psychiatric examination shall be privileged and shall not be disclosed
25 directly or indirectly to anyone other than a judge; probation officers
26 to whom an offender's file is duly transferred; the probation
27 administrator or his or her designee; alcohol and drug counselors, mental
28 health practitioners, psychiatrists, and psychologists licensed or
29 certified under the Uniform Credentialing Act to conduct substance abuse
30 evaluations and treatment; or others entitled by law to receive such
31 information, including personnel and mental health professionals for the

17 report, evaluation, or examination, as determined by the court, by the
18 prosecuting attorney and defense counsel. Such inspection shall be by
19 electronic access only unless the court determines such access is not
20 available to the prosecuting attorney or defense counsel. The State Court
21 Administrator shall determine and develop the means of electronic access
22 to such presentence reports, evaluations, and examinations. Upon
23 application by the prosecuting attorney or defense counsel, the court may
24 order that addresses, telephone numbers, and other contact information
25 for victims or witnesses named in the report, evaluation, or examination
26 be redacted upon a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that such
27 redaction is warranted in the interests of public safety. The court may
28 permit inspection of the presentence report, substance abuse evaluation,
29 or psychiatric examination or examination of parts of the report,
30 evaluation, or examination by any other person having a proper interest
31 therein whenever the court finds it is in the best interest of a
-54-

1 particular offender. The court may allow fair opportunity for an offender
2 to provide additional information for the court's consideration.

4 report of any presentence investigation, substance abuse evaluation, or
5 psychiatric examination shall be transmitted immediately to the

7 provide a copy of the report to the Board of Parole , the Division of
8 Parole Supervision, and the Board of Pardons.
9 (9) Notwithstanding subsections (6) and (7) of this section, the
10 Supreme Court or an agent of the Supreme Court acting under the direction
11 and supervision of the Chief Justice shall have access to psychiatric

-61-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 2024, is amended to read:
2 29-4803 (1) The probation administrator shall create a veteran
3 justice program as provided in sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 and subject to
4 the Supreme Court's rules. The program shall be available in every
5 district court and county court. A veteran justice program shall not
6 supersede, alter, or otherwise interfere with the establishment,
7 functioning, participation, or operation of a problem solving court
8 established pursuant to section 24-1302.
9 (2) A veteran justice program shall be operated by use of deferred
10 judgments as provided in this section.
11 (3) Upon a finding of guilt for which a judgment of conviction may
12 be rendered, a defendant that is eligible to participate in a veteran
13 justice program may request the court defer the entry of judgment of
14 conviction under this section. Upon such request, the court shall provide
15 notice to any victim of the offense of the request and provide an
16 opportunity for the victim to provide a statement for consideration by
17 the court. After giving the prosecutor and defendant the opportunity to
18 be heard, the court may defer the entry of a judgment of conviction and
19 the imposition of a sentence and place the defendant on probation, upon
20 conditions as the court may require under sections 29-2262 and 29-4804.
21 If the court defers the entry of judgment, the court shall provide notice
22 to victims of the offense.
23 (4)(a) Whenever a court considers a request to defer judgment under
24 this section, the court shall consider the following:
25 (i) The factors set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of section
26 29-2260 and section 29-4802;
27 (ii) The supervision, treatment, and other programming options
28 available in the community; and
29 (iii) Any other information the court deems relevant.
30 (b) Except as provided in subdivision (4)(c) of this section, there
31 shall be a presumption that a veteran eligible under section 29-4802
-62-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 shall be allowed to participate in a veteran justice program. The
2 presumption shall only be overcome by a judicial finding, based on an
3 individualized assessment of the veteran and consideration of the factors
4 set forth in subdivisions (4)(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section,
5 that entry of judgment of conviction should not be deferred. The fact
6 that a veteran has previously absconded from or violated pretrial
7 release, probation, parole, supervised release, post-release supervision,
8 or another form of court-ordered supervision, including a violation
9 arising from commission of a new offense or an offense committed while
10 previously participating in a veteran justice program, is not, standing
11 alone, a sufficient basis to overcome the presumption.
12 (c) The presumption provided for in subdivision (4)(b) of this
13 section does not apply to a veteran charged with:
14 (i) A violation of section 60-6,196 or 60-6,197, or a city or
15 village ordinance enacted in conformance with section 60-6,196 or
16 60-6,197, following a previous conviction for a violation of any such
17 section or ordinance; or
18 (ii) An offense that resulted in serious bodily injury to another
19 person.
20 (5) Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections
21 29-2293 and 29-2294, the supervision of a defendant on probation pursuant
22 to a deferred judgment shall be governed by the Nebraska Probation
23 Administration Act and sections 29-2270 to 29-2273.
24 (6) After a hearing providing the prosecutor and defendant an
25 opportunity to be heard and upon a finding that a defendant has violated
26 a condition of his or her probation, the court may enter any order
27 authorized by section 29-2268 or pronounce judgment and impose such new
28 sentence as might have been originally imposed for the offense for which
29 the defendant was convicted.
30 (7) Upon satisfactory completion of the conditions of probation and
31 the payment or waiver of all administrative and programming fees assessed
-63-

LB150 LB150
2025 2025
1 under section 29-2293, the defendant or prosecutor may file a motion to
2 withdraw any plea entered by the defendant and to dismiss the action
3 without entry of judgment. The court shall not grant such motion until a
4 victim of the offense has received notice and the opportunity to be
5 heard, as required by subsection (4) of section 29-4804.
6 (8) Sections 29-4802 to 29-4804 apply to offenses committed on or
7 after July 1, 2027 2025. For purposes of this subsection, an offense
8 shall be deemed to have been committed prior to July 1, 2027 2025, if any
9 element of the offense occurred prior to such date.
10 Sec. 42. Section 29-4807, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
11 2024, is amended to read:
12 29-4807 (1) The State Court Administrator shall compile information
13 on the number of veterans receiving, successfully completing, declining,
14 and denied participation in a veteran justice program and the sentencing
15 mitigation described in section 29-4805.
16 (2) The State Court Administrator shall track outcomes among
17 veterans who participate in a veteran justice program, including
18 completion status, recidivism, and housing and employment status.
19 (3) Data collected under this section shall be disaggregated by
20 race, ethnicity, gender, age, military discharge characterization, and
21 the offense involved.
22 (4) On or before July 1, 2028 2026, and on or before each July 1
23 thereafter, the State Court Administrator shall electronically submit a
24 report to the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature. The report shall
25 contain de-identified data collected pursuant to this section and shall
26 analyze the outcomes, successes, and areas for improvement of the veteran
27 justice programs and the sentencing mitigation described in section
28 29-4805.
29 Sec. 43. Section 32-221, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
30 2024, is amended to read:

5 clerks of election and inspectors shall be appointed at least thirty days
6 prior to the statewide primary election, shall hold office for terms of
7 two years or until their successors are appointed and qualified for the
8 next statewide primary election, and shall serve at all elections in the

23 Parole Supervision shall pay a monthly parole programming fee of twenty-
24 five dollars, not later than the tenth day of each month, beginning the
25 second month of parole supervision and continuing for the duration of the
26 parole.
27 (3) The board shall waive payment of the monthly parole programming
28 fee in whole or in part if after a hearing a determination is made that
29 such payment would constitute an undue hardship on the parolee due to
30 limited income, employment or school status, or physical or mental
31 handicap. Such waiver shall be in effect only during the period of time
-179-

LB150 LB150

16 revoked nor shall the parolee be imprisoned for such nonpayment if the
17 parolee is financially unable to make the payment.
18 (6) If the board determines that the default in payment described in
19 subsection (5) of this section was not attributable to a deliberate
20 refusal to obey the order of the board or to failure on the parolee's
21 part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for
22 payment, the board may allow the parolee additional time for payment,
23 reduce the amount of each installment, or revoke the fees or the unpaid
24 portion in whole or in part.
25 (7) No parolee shall be required to pay more than one monthly parole
26 programming fee per month.
27 (8) The imposition of monthly parole programming fees in this

15 consideration of committed offenders eligible for parole while the

20 the committed offender will not conform to the conditions of parole; or
21 (b) The board has determined that the committed offender's continued
22 correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in
23 the facility will substantially enhance the offender's capacity to lead a
24 law-abiding life when released at a later date. release of the committed
25 offender would have a very significant and quantifiable effect on
26 institutional discipline; or
27 (c) The board has determined that there is a very substantial risk
28 that the committed offender will commit a violent act against a person.
29 (4) In making the determination regarding the risk that a committed
30 offender will not conform to the conditions of parole, the board shall
31 take into account the factors set forth in subsection (2) of section
