1 dangerous weapon, or a firearm, the mandatory minimum term shall be three
2 years and the maximum term not more than the maximum term for the felony
3 committed or twenty years, whichever is greater. For this subdivision (1)
4 (c) to apply, no prior felony conviction may be a violation described in

6 (c) (d) If a greater punishment is otherwise provided by statute,
7 the law creating the greater punishment shall govern.
8 (2) When punishment of an accused as a habitual criminal is sought,

21 other state or by the United States, the court shall sentence such person
22 so convicted as a habitual criminal.

24 court before which the conviction was had that he or she was released
25 from imprisonment upon either of such sentences upon a pardon granted for
26 the reason that he or she was innocent, such conviction and sentence
27 shall not be considered as such under this section and section 29-2222.
28 Sec. 2. Original section 29-2221, Revised Statutes Cumulative
29 Supplement, 2024, is repealed.
