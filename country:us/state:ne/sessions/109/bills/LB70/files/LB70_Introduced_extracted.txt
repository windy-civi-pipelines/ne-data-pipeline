29 other state or by an Indian tribe as described in subsection (1) of
30 section 43-1406, or (iii) by the marriage of his or her parents as
31 described in section 42-377 or subsection (2) of section 43-1406; or

1 (b) Whose paternity is presumed as described in section 43-1409 or
2 subsection (2) of section 43-1415; or .
3 (c) Who has been adopted by a second adult person under subdivision
4 (1)(c) of section 43-101.
5 (2)(a) (2) The father, not having entered into a judicially approved
6 settlement or being in default in the performance of the same, may be
7 made a respondent in such action. The mother of the child may also be
8 made a respondent in such an action. For a child adopted by a second
9 adult person under subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-101, either or both
10 parents, not having entered into a judicially approved settlement or
11 being in default in the performance of the same, may be made respondents
12 in such an action.
13 (b) Such action shall be commenced by a complaint of the mother of
14 the child, the father of the child whose paternity has been established,
15 either parent of a child adopted by a second adult person under
16 subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-101, the guardian or next friend of the
17 child, the county attorney, or an authorized attorney.
18 (3) The complaint shall set forth the basis on which paternity was
19 previously established or presumed, if the respondent is the father, and
20 the fact of nonsupport and shall ask that the father, the mother, either
21 parent of a child adopted by a second adult person under subdivision (1)
22 (c) of section 43-101, or both parents be ordered to provide for the
23 support of the child. Summons shall issue against the father, the mother,
24 either parent of a child adopted by a second adult person under
25 subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-101, or both parents and be served as in
26 other civil proceedings, except that such summons may be directed to the
27 sheriff of any county in the state and may be served in any county. The
28 method of trial shall be the same as in actions formerly cognizable in
29 equity, and jurisdiction to hear and determine such actions for support
30 is hereby vested in the district court of the district or the county
31 court of the county where the child is domiciled or found or, for cases
-15-
LB70 LB70
2025 2025
1 under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act if the child is not
2 domiciled or found in Nebraska, where the parent of the child is
3 domiciled.
4 (4) In such proceeding, if the defendant is the presumed father as
5 described in subdivision (1)(b) of this section, the court shall make a
6 finding whether or not the presumption of paternity has been rebutted.
7 The presumption of paternity created by acknowledgment as described in
8 section 43-1409 may be rebutted as part of an equitable proceeding to
9 establish support by genetic testing results which exclude the alleged
10 father as being the biological father of the child. A court in such a
11 proceeding may order genetic testing as provided in sections 43-1414 to
12 43-1418.
13 (5) If the court finds that either the father, the mother, or both
14 parents have failed adequately to support the child, the court shall
15 issue a decree directing such parent or parents him, her, or them to do
16 so, specifying the amount of such support, the manner in which it shall
17 be furnished, and the amount, if any, of any court costs and attorney's
18 fees to be paid by such parent or parents the father, the mother, or both
19 parents. Income withholding shall be ordered pursuant to the Income
20 Withholding for Child Support Act. The court may require the furnishing
21 of bond to insure the performance of the decree in the same manner as is
22 provided for in section 42-358.05 or 43-1405. Failure on the part of the
23 defendant to perform the terms of such decree shall constitute contempt
24 of court and may be dealt with in the same manner as other contempts. The
25 court may also order medical support and the payment of expenses as
26 described in section 43-1407.
27 Sec. 10. Section 43-1401, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 43-1401 For purposes of sections 43-1401 to 43-1418:

19 the child's its support. Both parents of a child adopted by a second
20 adult person under subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-101 shall be liable
21 for the child's support. The liability of each parent may be determined,
22 enforced, and discharged in accordance with the methods hereinafter
23 provided.

25 amended to read:

29 other state or by an Indian tribe as described in subsection (1) of
30 section 43-1406, or (iii) by the marriage of his or her parents as
31 described in section 42-377 or subsection (2) of section 43-1406; or

LB70 LB70
2025 2025
1 (b) Whose paternity is presumed as described in section 43-1409 or
2 subsection (2) of section 43-1415; or .
3 (c) Who has been adopted by a second adult person under subdivision
4 (1)(c) of section 43-101.
5 (2)(a) (2) The father, not having entered into a judicially approved
6 settlement or being in default in the performance of the same, may be
7 made a respondent in such action. The mother of the child may also be
8 made a respondent in such an action. For a child adopted by a second
9 adult person under subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-101, either or both
10 parents, not having entered into a judicially approved settlement or
11 being in default in the performance of the same, may be made respondents
12 in such an action.
13 (b) Such action shall be commenced by a complaint of the mother of
14 the child, the father of the child whose paternity has been established,
15 either parent of a child adopted by a second adult person under
16 subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-101, the guardian or next friend of the

21 parent of a child adopted by a second adult person under subdivision (1)
22 (c) of section 43-101, or both parents be ordered to provide for the
23 support of the child. Summons shall issue against the father, the mother,
24 either parent of a child adopted by a second adult person under
25 subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-101, or both parents and be served as in
26 other civil proceedings, except that such summons may be directed to the
27 sheriff of any county in the state and may be served in any county. The
28 method of trial shall be the same as in actions formerly cognizable in
29 equity, and jurisdiction to hear and determine such actions for support

2 domiciled or found in Nebraska, where the parent of the child is
3 domiciled.
4 (4) In such proceeding, if the defendant is the presumed father as
5 described in subdivision (1)(b) of this section, the court shall make a
6 finding whether or not the presumption of paternity has been rebutted.
7 The presumption of paternity created by acknowledgment as described in
8 section 43-1409 may be rebutted as part of an equitable proceeding to
9 establish support by genetic testing results which exclude the alleged
10 father as being the biological father of the child. A court in such a
11 proceeding may order genetic testing as provided in sections 43-1414 to
12 43-1418.
13 (5) If the court finds that either the father, the mother, or both

18 fees to be paid by such parent or parents the father, the mother, or both
19 parents. Income withholding shall be ordered pursuant to the Income
20 Withholding for Child Support Act. The court may require the furnishing
21 of bond to insure the performance of the decree in the same manner as is
22 provided for in section 42-358.05 or 43-1405. Failure on the part of the
23 defendant to perform the terms of such decree shall constitute contempt
24 of court and may be dealt with in the same manner as other contempts. The
25 court may also order medical support and the payment of expenses as
26 described in section 43-1407.
