2 amended to read:
3 75-426 The commission may investigate the cause of all accidents on
4 any railroad within this state that result in loss of life or injury to
5 any person or property. Upon the occurrence of any such serious personal
6 injury or loss of life to persons other than railroad employees resulting
7 from an accident at a railroad crossing or from an accident involving an
8 explosion, fire, or release of noxious fumes occurring upon any railroad
9 within the State of Nebraska, the corporation which operates the railroad
10 upon which the accident occurred shall report such accident in writing or
11 by telephone to the commission within twenty-four hours of the time such
12 accident occurred. The commission shall promptly investigate any such
13 accident and a report shall be made a part of the commission's official
14 files. The corporation which operates the railroad shall also furnish to
15 the commission a copy of the same report that it is required to furnish
16 to the Federal Railroad Administration. Neither of such reports shall be
17 evidence or referred to in any case in any court. Any railroad carrier
18 violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a
19 Class IV misdemeanor.
20 Sec. 2. Original section 75-426, Reissue Revised Statutes of
21 Nebraska, is repealed.
