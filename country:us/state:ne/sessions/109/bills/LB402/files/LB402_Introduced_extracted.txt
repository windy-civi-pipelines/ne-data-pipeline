15 certified debt of twenty-five dollars or more to the collection system

2025 2025
1 depending on the actual amount owed.
2 (5) (4) If the name of the obligor is retrieved from the collection
3 system by the operator, the retrieval of such name shall be evidence of a
4 valid lien upon and claim of lien against any applicable winnings of the
5 obligor whose name is electronically retrieved from the collection
6 system. If an obligor's applicable winnings are required to be set off
7 pursuant to the Gambling Winnings Setoff for Outstanding Debt Act, the
8 full amount of the debt and outstanding state tax liability shall be
9 collected from any applicable winnings due the obligor.
10 (6) (5) The information obtained by an operator from the collection
11 system in accordance with this section shall retain its confidentiality
12 and shall only be used by the operator for the purposes of complying with
13 the Gambling Winnings Setoff for Outstanding Debt Act. An employee or
14 prior employee of an operator who unlawfully discloses any such

29 disclosure of confidential information by an agent or employee of either
30 such department.

10 and shall remit the net winnings payment, if any, to the winner and the
11 amount deducted to the Department of Revenue in a manner prescribed by
12 the department.

17 winner is being remitted to the department.

20 48-665 (1) Any person who has received any sum as benefits under the

23 erroneous benefit payments shall be collectible (a) without interest by
24 civil action in the name of the commissioner, (b) by offset against any
25 future benefits payable to the claimant with respect to the benefit year
26 current at the time of such receipt or any benefit year which may
27 commence within three years after the end of such current benefit year,
28 except that no such recoupment by the withholding of future benefits
29 shall be had if such sum was received by such person without fault on his
30 or her part and such recoupment would defeat the purpose of the
31 Employment Security Law or would be against equity and good conscience,
-10-
LB402 LB402
2025 2025
1 (c) by setoff against any state income tax refund due the claimant
2 pursuant to sections 77-27,197 to 77-27,209, (d) by offset against any
3 winnings payment pursuant to the Gambling Winnings Setoff for Outstanding

5 (2) The commissioner may recover a covered unemployment compensation
6 debt, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6402, by setoff against a liable party's
7 federal income tax refund. Such setoff shall be made in accordance with
8 such section and United States Treasury regulations and guidelines
9 adopted pursuant thereto. The commissioner shall notify the debtor that
10 the commissioner plans to recover the debt through setoff against any
11 federal income tax refund, and the debtor shall be given sixty days to
12 present evidence that all or part of the liability is either not legally
13 enforceable or is not a covered unemployment compensation debt. The
14 commissioner shall review any evidence presented and determine that the
15 debt is legally enforceable and is a covered unemployment compensation
16 debt before proceeding further with the offset. The amount recovered,
17 less any administrative fees charged by the United States Treasury, shall
18 be credited to the debt owed. Any determination rendered under this
19 subsection that the liable party's federal income tax refund is not
20 subject to setoff does not require the commissioner to amend the
21 commissioner's initial determination that formed the basis for the
22 proposed setoff.
23 Sec. 9. Original section 48-665, Reissue Revised Statutes of
24 Nebraska, and sections 9-1302, 9-1303, 9-1304, 9-1306, 9-1307, 9-1308,
25 and 9-1313, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.

2025 2025
1 depending on the actual amount owed.
2 (5) (4) If the name of the obligor is retrieved from the collection
3 system by the operator, the retrieval of such name shall be evidence of a
4 valid lien upon and claim of lien against any applicable winnings of the
5 obligor whose name is electronically retrieved from the collection
6 system. If an obligor's applicable winnings are required to be set off
7 pursuant to the Gambling Winnings Setoff for Outstanding Debt Act, the

29 disclosure of confidential information by an agent or employee of either
30 such department.

24 civil action in the name of the commissioner, (b) by offset against any
25 future benefits payable to the claimant with respect to the benefit year
26 current at the time of such receipt or any benefit year which may
27 commence within three years after the end of such current benefit year,
28 except that no such recoupment by the withholding of future benefits

-10-

LB402 LB402
2025 2025
1 (c) by setoff against any state income tax refund due the claimant
2 pursuant to sections 77-27,197 to 77-27,209, (d) by offset against any

5 (2) The commissioner may recover a covered unemployment compensation
6 debt, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6402, by setoff against a liable party's
7 federal income tax refund. Such setoff shall be made in accordance with
8 such section and United States Treasury regulations and guidelines
9 adopted pursuant thereto. The commissioner shall notify the debtor that
10 the commissioner plans to recover the debt through setoff against any
11 federal income tax refund, and the debtor shall be given sixty days to
12 present evidence that all or part of the liability is either not legally
13 enforceable or is not a covered unemployment compensation debt. The
14 commissioner shall review any evidence presented and determine that the
15 debt is legally enforceable and is a covered unemployment compensation
16 debt before proceeding further with the offset. The amount recovered,
17 less any administrative fees charged by the United States Treasury, shall
18 be credited to the debt owed. Any determination rendered under this
19 subsection that the liable party's federal income tax refund is not
20 subject to setoff does not require the commissioner to amend the
21 commissioner's initial determination that formed the basis for the
22 proposed setoff.
23 Sec. 9. Original section 48-665, Reissue Revised Statutes of
24 Nebraska, and sections 9-1302, 9-1303, 9-1304, 9-1306, 9-1307, 9-1308,
25 and 9-1313, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
