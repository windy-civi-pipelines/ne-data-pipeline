1 Section 1. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska
4 Revenue Act of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner
5 monthly on or before the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each
6 monthly period unless otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
7 Act of 1967.
8 (b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each
9 monthly period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require,
10 a return for such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with
11 the Tax Commissioner in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may
12 prescribe and containing such information as the Tax Commissioner deems
13 necessary for the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of
14 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he or she deems it necessary in order to
15 insure payment to or facilitate the collection by the state of the amount
16 of sales or use taxes due, may require returns and payment of the amount
17 of such taxes for periods other than monthly periods in the case of a
18 particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case may be. The Tax
19 Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and tax
20 payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
21 tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
22 agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers',
23 or purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars,
24 quarterly returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine
25 hundred dollars or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly
26 returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand
27 dollars or more. The Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow
28 an annual return for seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax
29 liability exceeds the amounts listed in this subdivision.
30 The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
31 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
-2-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
2 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
3 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
4 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
5 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
6 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
7 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
8 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
9 amount shall be imposed.
10 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
11 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
12 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
13 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
14 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
15 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use
16 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
17 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
18 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
19 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
20 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
21 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
22 but need not be verified by oath.
23 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
24 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
25 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
26 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
27 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
28 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
29 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
30 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
31 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
-3-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
2 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
3 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
4 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
5 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
6 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
7 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
8 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
9 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
10 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
11 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
12 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
13 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
14 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
15 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the
16 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
17 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
18 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
19 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
20 notified the Tax Commissioner.
21 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
22 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
23 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
24 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
25 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
26 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
27 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
28 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
29 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
30 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
31 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
-4-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
2 penalty shall be five dollars.
3 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
4 due from him or her on his or her tax return, three percent of the first
5 five thousand dollars remitted each month to reimburse himself or herself
6 for the cost of collecting the tax. Taxpayers filing a combined return as
7 allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii) of this subsection shall compute such
8 collection fees on the basis of the receipts and liability of each
9 licensed location. If a model 1 seller's sales and use tax functions are
10 performed by a certified service provider and the certified service
11 provider is compensated pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax
12 agreement for performing such functions, then the model 1 seller shall
13 not receive any collection fees under this subdivision.
14 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
15 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
16 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
17 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
18 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
19 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
20 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
21 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
22 provided in section 77-2704.35.
23 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
24 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
25 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
26 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
27 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
28 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
29 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
30 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
31 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
-5-

2025 2025
1 marketplace platform operator.
2 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
3 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
4 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
5 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
6 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
7 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
8 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
9 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
10 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
11 executors.
12 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
13 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
14 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
15 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
16 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
17 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
18 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
19 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been
20 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
21 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
22 account of overpayment.
23 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
24 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
25 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
26 dollars.
27 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
28 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
29 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
30 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
31 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
-6-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
2 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
3 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
4 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
5 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
6 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
7 determination.
8 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
9 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
10 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
11 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided
12 in section 77-27,127.
13 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
14 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
15 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
16 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
17 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
18 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
19 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is
20 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
21 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
22 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
23 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
24 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
25 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
26 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
27 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
28 filed.
29 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
30 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
31 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
-7-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
2 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
3 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
4 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
5 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
6 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
7 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
8 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
9 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
10 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
11 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
12 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
13 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
14 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
15 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
16 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
17 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
18 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
19 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income
20 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
21 return.
22 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
23 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
24 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
25 which the collection is made.
26 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
27 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
28 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
29 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
30 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.
31 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
-8-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
2 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
3 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
4 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
5 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
6 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
7 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
8 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
9 other charges.
10 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
11 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
12 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
13 the state shall permit the allocation.
14 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
15 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
16 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
17 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
18 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
19 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
20 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
21 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
22 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
23 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
24 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
25 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
26 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
27 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
28 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
29 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
30 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of
31 section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable. This subsection shall not
-9-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision (2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii)
2 or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
3 Sec. 2. Section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
4 2024, is amended to read:
5 77-2711 (1)(a) The Tax Commissioner shall enforce sections
6 77-2701.04 to 77-2713 and may prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and
7 regulations relating to the administration and enforcement of such

9 (b) The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the extent to which any
10 ruling or regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.
11 (2) The Tax Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors,
12 investigators, assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient
13 administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and may delegate
14 authority to his or her representatives to conduct hearings, prescribe
15 regulations, or perform any other duties imposed by such act.
16 (3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing,
17 using, or otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a
18 retailer shall keep such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent
19 papers in such form as the Tax Commissioner may reasonably require.
20 (b) Every such seller, retailer, or person shall keep such records
21 for not less than three years from the making of such records unless the
22 Tax Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
23 (4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him
24 or her may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any
25 person selling property and any person liable for the use tax and may
26 investigate the character of the business of the person in order to
27 verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the
28 person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the
29 examination of any person selling property or of any person liable for
30 the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as to the accuracy of the reporting
31 of city and county sales and use taxes for which the person is liable
-10-

2025 2025
1 under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections 13-319, 13-324, 13-2813,
2 and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made between the various
3 counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the tax due. The
4 Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
5 exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person
6 having custody of the records for providing such copies.
7 (5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her
8 records at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records
9 available to the Tax Commissioner at all times.
10 (6) In administration of the use tax, the Tax Commissioner may
11 require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in
12 his, her, or their possession or custody information relating to sales of
13 property, the storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to
14 the tax. The report shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and
15 shall set forth the names and addresses of purchasers of the property,
16 the sales price of the property, the date of sale, and such other
17 information as the Tax Commissioner may require.
18 (7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner, or
19 any official or employee of the Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, or
20 the Department of Administrative Services, or any other person to make
21 known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or
22 information obtained by an investigation of records and activities of any
23 retailer or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of
24 official duty or the amount or source of income, profits, losses,
25 expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any
26 return, or to permit any return or copy thereof, or any book containing
27 any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person
28 not connected with the Tax Commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be
29 construed to prohibit (a) the delivery to a taxpayer, his or her duly
30 authorized representative, or his or her successors, receivers, trustees,
31 executors, administrators, assignees, or guarantors, if directly

27 reports or returns of any person filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
28 Act of 1967 when information on the reports or returns is relevant to any

1 this subsection.
2 (15) In all proceedings under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, the

4 Nebraska. The Tax Commissioner in his or her discretion may waive all or
5 part of any penalties provided by the provisions of such act or interest
6 on delinquent taxes specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from
7 time to time be adjusted.
8 (16)(a) The purpose of this subsection is to set forth the state's
9 policy for the protection of the confidentiality rights of all
10 participants in the system operated pursuant to the streamlined sales and
11 use tax agreement and of the privacy interests of consumers who deal with
12 model 1 sellers.
13 (b) For purposes of this subsection:
14 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
15 person;
16 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
17 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
18 (iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
19 identifies a person.
20 (c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers
21 is to preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity.
22 With very limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform
23 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
24 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
25 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
26 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only
27 if that certified service provider certifies that:
28 (i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the
29 fundamental precept of anonymity is respected;
30 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
31 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to
-17-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 exempt purchasers;
2 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
3 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
4 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at
5 all, it retains the information, and whether it discloses the information
6 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
7 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
8 service provider;
9 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
10 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
11 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
12 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
13 and
14 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
15 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
16 unauthorized access and disclosure.
17 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
18 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
19 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
20 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
21 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
22 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
23 longer be retained by the member states.
24 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
25 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
26 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
27 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
28 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
29 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
30 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
31 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
-18-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 such request.
2 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
3 General.
4 (j) All other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use,
5 and maintenance of confidential taxpayer information remain fully
6 applicable and binding. Without limitation, this subsection does not
7 enlarge or limit the state's authority to:
8 (i) Conduct audits or other reviews as provided under the agreement
9 and state law;
10 (ii) Provide records pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information
11 Act, disclosure laws with governmental agencies, or other regulations;
12 (iii) Prevent, consistent with state law, disclosure of confidential
13 taxpayer information;
14 (iv) Prevent, consistent with federal law, disclosure or misuse of
15 federal return information obtained under a disclosure agreement with the
16 Internal Revenue Service; and
17 (v) Collect, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise use anonymous data
18 for governmental purposes.

22 amended to read:
23 77-27,143 (1) The administration of all sales and use taxes adopted

28 act. The incorporated municipality shall furnish a certified copy of the
29 adopting or repealing ordinance to the Tax Commissioner in accordance
30 with such rules and regulations as he or she may adopt and promulgate.
31 For ordinances passed after October 1, 1969, the effective date shall be
-26-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 the first day of the next calendar quarter which is at least one hundred
2 twenty days following receipt by the Tax Commissioner of the certified
3 copy of the ordinance. The Tax Commissioner shall provide at least sixty
4 days' notice of the change in tax to retailers. Notice shall be provided
5 to retailers within the municipality. Notice to retailers may be provided
6 through the website of the Department of Revenue or by other electronic
7 means.
8 (2) For ordinances containing a termination date and passed after
9 October 1, 1986, the termination date shall be the first day of a
10 calendar quarter. The incorporated municipality shall furnish a certified
11 statement to the Tax Commissioner no more than one hundred eighty days
12 and at least one hundred twenty days prior to the termination date that
13 the termination date stated in the ordinance is still valid. If the
14 certified statement is not furnished within the prescribed time, the tax
15 shall remain in effect, and the Tax Commissioner shall continue to
16 collect the tax until the first day of the calendar quarter which is at
17 least one hundred twenty days after receipt of the certified statement
18 notwithstanding the termination date stated in the ordinance. The Tax
19 Commissioner shall provide at least sixty days' notice of the termination
20 of the tax to retailers. Notice shall be provided to retailers within the
21 municipality. Notice to retailers may be provided through the website of
22 the department or by other electronic means.
23 (3) For sales and use tax purposes only, local jurisdiction boundary
24 changes apply only on the first day of a calendar quarter after a minimum
25 of one hundred twenty days' notice to the Tax Commissioner and sixty
26 days' notice to sellers.
27 (4) The state shall provide and maintain a database that describes
28 boundary changes for all local taxing jurisdictions. This database shall
29 include a description of any change and the effective date of the change
30 for sales and use tax purposes.
31 (5) The state shall provide and maintain a database of all sales and
-27-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 use tax rates for all of the local jurisdictions levying taxes within the
2 state. For the identification of counties, cities, and villages, codes
3 corresponding to the rates shall be provided according to Federal
4 Information Processing Standards as developed by the National Institute
5 of Standards and Technology.
6 (6) The state shall provide and maintain a database that assigns
7 each five-digit and nine-digit zip code within the state to the proper
8 tax rates and jurisdictions. For purposes of the streamlined sales and
9 use tax agreement, the database shall apply the lowest combined tax rate
10 imposed in the nine-digit zip code area if the area includes more than
11 one tax rate in any level of taxing jurisdictions, and the database shall
12 apply the highest combined tax rate imposed in the five-digit zip code
13 area if the area includes more than one tax rate in any level of taxing
14 jurisdictions. If a nine-digit zip code designation is not available for
15 a street address or if a seller is unable to determine the nine-digit zip
16 code designation applicable to a purchase after exercising due diligence
17 to determine the designation, the seller or certified service provider
18 may apply the rate for the five-digit zip code area. For purposes of this
19 section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a seller or certified
20 service provider has exercised due diligence if the seller has attempted
21 to determine the nine-digit zip code designation by utilizing software
22 approved by the governing board that makes this designation from the
23 street address and the five-digit zip code applicable to a purchase.
24 (7) For purposes of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
25 state may provide address-based boundary database records for assigning
26 taxing jurisdictions and their associated rates which shall be in
27 addition to the requirements of subsection (6) of this section. The
28 database records shall be in the same approved format as the database
29 records pursuant to subsection (6) of this section and shall meet the
30 requirements developed pursuant to the federal Mobile Telecommunications
31 Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C. 119(a), as such act existed on January 1, 2003.
-28-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 The governing board may allow a member state to require sellers that
2 register under the agreement to use an address-based boundary database
3 provided by that member state. If any member state develops an address-
4 based boundary database pursuant to the agreement, a seller or certified
5 service provider may use those database records in place of the five-
6 digit and nine-digit zip code database records provided for in subsection
7 (6) of this section. If a seller or certified service provider is unable
8 to determine the applicable rate and jurisdiction using an address-based
9 boundary database after exercising due diligence, the seller or certified
10 service provider may apply the nine-digit zip code designation applicable
11 to a purchase. If a nine-digit zip code designation is not available for
12 a street address or if a seller or certified service provider is unable
13 to determine the nine-digit zip code designation applicable to a purchase
14 after exercising due diligence to determine the designation, the seller
15 or certified service provider may apply the rate for the five-digit zip
16 code area. For the purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable
17 presumption that a seller or certified service provider has exercised due
18 diligence if the seller or certified service provider has attempted to
19 determine the tax rate and jurisdiction by utilizing software approved by
20 the governing board that makes this assignment from the address and zip
21 code information applicable to the purchase.
22 (8) The state may certify vendor-provided address-based boundary
23 databases for assigning tax rates and jurisdictions. The databases shall
24 be in the same approved format as the database records pursuant to
25 subsection (7) of this section and shall meet the requirements developed
26 pursuant to the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C.
27 119(a) as such act existed on January 1, 2003. If a state certifies a
28 vendor-provided address-based boundary database, a seller or certified
29 service provider may use that database in place of the database provided
30 for in subsection (6) or (7) of this section. Vendors providing address-
31 based boundary databases may request certification of their databases

2025 2025
1 from the governing board. Certification by the governing board does not
2 replace the requirement that the databases be certified by the states
3 individually.
4 (9) Pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
5 state shall relieve retailers and certified service providers using
6 databases pursuant to subsection (6) or (7) of this section from
7 liability to the state and local jurisdictions for having charged and
8 collected the incorrect amount of sales or use tax resulting from the
9 retailer or certified service provider relying on erroneous data provided
10 by a member state on tax rates, boundaries, or taxing jurisdiction
11 assignments. After providing adequate notice determined by the governing
12 board, a member state that provides an address-based boundary database
13 for assigning taxing jurisdictions pursuant to subsection (7) or (8) of
14 this section may cease providing liability relief for errors resulting
15 from the reliance on the database provided by the member state under the
16 provisions of subsection (6) of this section. If a seller demonstrates
17 that requiring the use of the address-based boundary database would
18 create an undue hardship, the state and the governing board may extend
19 the relief of liability to such seller for a designated period of time.
20 (10) The databases provided for in this section shall be in a
21 downloadable format approved by the governing board pursuant to the
22 streamlined sales and use tax agreement. The databases may be directly
23 provided by the state or provided by a vendor as designated by the state.
24 A database provided by a vendor as designated by a state shall be
25 applicable to and subject to all provisions of this section. The
26 databases shall be provided at no cost to the user of the database. The
27 provisions of subsections (6) and (7) of this section do not apply when
28 the purchased product is received by the purchaser at the business
29 location of the seller.
30 (11) A seller that did not have a requirement to register in this
31 state prior to registering pursuant to the agreement or a certified
-30-
LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 service provider shall not be required to collect sales or use taxes for
2 a state until the first day of the calendar quarter commencing more than
3 sixty days after the state has provided the databases required by this
4 section.

LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA
ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE BILL 208
Introduced by von Gillern, 4.
Read first time January 14, 2025
Committee: Revenue
1 A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to revenue and taxation; to amend sections
2 77-2712.03 and 77-27,143, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and
3 sections 77-2708, 77-2711, 77-2715.07, 77-27,241, 77-7012, and
4 77-7203, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024; to change

9 guardians; to harmonize provisions; and to repeal the original
10 sections.
11 Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
-1-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 Section 1. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska
4 Revenue Act of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner
5 monthly on or before the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each
6 monthly period unless otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
7 Act of 1967.
8 (b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each
9 monthly period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require,
10 a return for such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with
11 the Tax Commissioner in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may
12 prescribe and containing such information as the Tax Commissioner deems
13 necessary for the proper administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of
14 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he or she deems it necessary in order to
15 insure payment to or facilitate the collection by the state of the amount
16 of sales or use taxes due, may require returns and payment of the amount
17 of such taxes for periods other than monthly periods in the case of a
18 particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case may be. The Tax
19 Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and tax
20 payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
21 tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
22 agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers',
23 or purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars,
24 quarterly returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine
25 hundred dollars or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly
26 returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand
27 dollars or more. The Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow
28 an annual return for seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax
29 liability exceeds the amounts listed in this subdivision.
30 The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
31 to allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making
-2-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 monthly remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic
2 funds transfer or for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to
3 the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations
4 may establish a method of determining the amount of the payment that will
5 result in substantially all of the tax liability being paid each quarter.
6 At least once each year, the difference between the amount paid and the
7 amount due shall be reconciled. If the difference is more than ten
8 percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty percent of the unpaid
9 amount shall be imposed.
10 (ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
11 retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state
12 of the tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all
13 licensed locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of
14 this subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own
15 eighty percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use
16 tax, a return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in
17 this state and by every person who has purchased property, the storage,
18 use, or other consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has
19 not paid the use tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
20 (iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
21 person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent
22 but need not be verified by oath.
23 (iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a
24 cash basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting
25 basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the
26 sales and use tax returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on
27 the same accounting basis that is used for the regular books and records,
28 except that on credit, conditional, and installment sales, the retailer
29 who keeps his or her books on an accrual basis may report such sales on
30 the cash basis and pay the tax upon the collections made during each
31 month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells, assigns, or otherwise disposes of
-3-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 an account receivable, he or she shall be deemed to have received the
2 full balance of the consideration for the original sale and shall be
3 liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of the total
4 sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
5 assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer
6 to a subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the
7 sales tax on the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior
8 to the time the customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary
9 does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a
10 surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the
11 tax and any interest and penalty imposed thereon under this section in an
12 amount not less than two times the amount of tax payable on outstanding
13 accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior
14 calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax permit or a surety
15 bond in accordance with this section shall result in the payment on the
16 next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously remitted.
17 When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting credit,
18 conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
19 will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having
20 notified the Tax Commissioner.
21 (c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax
22 agreement, the taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail
23 any required return together with a remittance of the net amount of the
24 tax due to the office of the Tax Commissioner on or before the required
25 filing date. Failure to file the return, filing after the required filing
26 date, failure to remit the net amount of the tax due, or remitting the
27 net amount of the tax due after the required filing date shall be cause
28 for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten percent of the amount of
29 tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-five dollars,
30 whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
31 subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a
-4-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 county treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the
2 penalty shall be five dollars.
3 (d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise
4 due from him or her on his or her tax return, three percent of the first
5 five thousand dollars remitted each month to reimburse himself or herself
6 for the cost of collecting the tax. Taxpayers filing a combined return as
7 allowed by subdivision (1)(b)(ii) of this subsection shall compute such
8 collection fees on the basis of the receipts and liability of each
9 licensed location. If a model 1 seller's sales and use tax functions are
10 performed by a certified service provider and the certified service
11 provider is compensated pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax
12 agreement for performing such functions, then the model 1 seller shall
13 not receive any collection fees under this subdivision.
14 (e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
15 marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
16 sales taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and
17 remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must
18 include all sales into Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but
19 may claim credit for any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
20 multivendor marketplace platform with respect to such retailer's sales.
21 Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due on sales into Nebraska as
22 provided in section 77-2704.35.
23 (f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation
24 to collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to
25 Nebraska to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can
26 establish that the error was due to insufficient or incorrect information
27 given to the multivendor marketplace platform by the seller and relied on
28 by the multivendor marketplace platform. This subdivision shall not apply
29 if the multivendor marketplace platform and the seller are related
30 persons under either section 267(b) or (c) or section 707(b) of the
31 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also the multivendor
-5-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 marketplace platform operator.
2 (2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
3 amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been
4 erroneously or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the
5 purchaser qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax
6 Commissioner shall set forth that fact in his or her records and the
7 excess amount collected or paid may be credited on any sales, use, or
8 income tax amounts then due and payable from the person under the
9 Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be refunded to the person
10 by whom it was paid or his or her successors, administrators, or
11 executors.
12 (b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with
13 the Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her
14 attorney, executor, or administrator within three years from the required
15 filing date following the close of the period for which the overpayment
16 was made, within six months after any determination becomes final under
17 section 77-2709, or within six months from the date of overpayment with
18 respect to such determinations, whichever of these three periods expires
19 later, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been
20 given. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this
21 subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state on
22 account of overpayment.
23 (c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
24 Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which
25 the claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two
26 dollars.
27 (d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
28 hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing
29 shall constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The
30 claimant and the Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-
31 hundred-eighty-day period. If a hearing has not been requested and the
-6-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 Tax Commissioner has neither allowed nor disallowed a claim within either
2 the one hundred eighty days or the period agreed to by the claimant and
3 the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed to have been allowed.
4 (e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in
5 part, the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the
6 claimant in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency
7 determination.
8 (f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
9 Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
10 Act of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the
11 taxpayer seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided
12 in section 77-27,127.
13 (g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously
14 or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without
15 authority, or of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully
16 collected, interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such
17 credit or refund at the rate specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate
18 may from time to time be adjusted, from the date such sum was paid or
19 from the date the return was required to be filed, whichever date is
20 later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or, in the case of a
21 credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is
22 allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess
23 of actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest
24 shall be allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
25 (h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
26 recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
27 determined or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly
28 filed.
29 (i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof
30 which is erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is
31 erroneously allowed by issuing a deficiency determination within one year
-7-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 from the date of refund or credit or within the period otherwise allowed
2 for issuing a deficiency determination, whichever expires later.
3 (j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
4 repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue
5 Act of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not
6 including interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as
7 such section existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated
8 pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges
9 or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price;
10 uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the
11 seller until the full purchase price is paid; and expenses incurred in
12 attempting to collect any debt and repossessed property.
13 (ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during
14 which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's
15 books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax
16 purposes. A claimant who is not required to file federal income tax
17 returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
18 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
19 records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income
20 tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax
21 return.
22 (iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is
23 subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so
24 collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in
25 which the collection is made.
26 (iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales
27 for the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim
28 may be filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for
29 refund claims. The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due
30 date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed.
31 (v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified
-8-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 service provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the
2 retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The certified
3 service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt
4 allowance or refund received to the retailer.
5 (vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously
6 claimed bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied
7 first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and
8 the sales tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any
9 other charges.
10 (vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party
11 claiming the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts
12 among the member states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement,
13 the state shall permit the allocation.
14 (3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section
15 involves a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or
16 section 13-319, 13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be
17 refunded is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall
18 notify the affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such
19 claim within twenty days after receiving the claim. If the Tax
20 Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax is at least five
21 thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city,
22 village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall give the
23 city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
24 refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
25 monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county
26 shall make its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax
27 Commissioner within twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The
28 Tax Commissioner shall then deduct such refund from the applicable tax
29 proceeds in accordance with the selection when he or she deducts refunds
30 pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814, or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of
31 section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable. This subsection shall not
-9-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision (2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii)
2 or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
3 Sec. 2. Section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
4 2024, is amended to read:
5 77-2711 (1)(a) The Tax Commissioner shall enforce sections
6 77-2701.04 to 77-2713 and may prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and
7 regulations relating to the administration and enforcement of such
8 sections.
9 (b) The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the extent to which any
10 ruling or regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.
11 (2) The Tax Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors,
12 investigators, assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient
13 administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and may delegate
14 authority to his or her representatives to conduct hearings, prescribe
15 regulations, or perform any other duties imposed by such act.
16 (3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing,
17 using, or otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a
18 retailer shall keep such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent
19 papers in such form as the Tax Commissioner may reasonably require.
20 (b) Every such seller, retailer, or person shall keep such records
21 for not less than three years from the making of such records unless the
22 Tax Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
23 (4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him
24 or her may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any
25 person selling property and any person liable for the use tax and may
26 investigate the character of the business of the person in order to
27 verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the
28 person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the
29 examination of any person selling property or of any person liable for
30 the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as to the accuracy of the reporting
31 of city and county sales and use taxes for which the person is liable
-10-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections 13-319, 13-324, 13-2813,
2 and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made between the various
3 counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the tax due. The
4 Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
5 exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person
6 having custody of the records for providing such copies.
7 (5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her
8 records at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records
9 available to the Tax Commissioner at all times.
10 (6) In administration of the use tax, the Tax Commissioner may
11 require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in
12 his, her, or their possession or custody information relating to sales of
13 property, the storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to
14 the tax. The report shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and
15 shall set forth the names and addresses of purchasers of the property,
16 the sales price of the property, the date of sale, and such other
17 information as the Tax Commissioner may require.
18 (7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner, or
19 any official or employee of the Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, or
20 the Department of Administrative Services, or any other person to make
21 known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or
22 information obtained by an investigation of records and activities of any
23 retailer or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of
24 official duty or the amount or source of income, profits, losses,
25 expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any
26 return, or to permit any return or copy thereof, or any book containing
27 any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person
28 not connected with the Tax Commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be
29 construed to prohibit (a) the delivery to a taxpayer, his or her duly
30 authorized representative, or his or her successors, receivers, trustees,
31 executors, administrators, assignees, or guarantors, if directly
-11-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 interested, of a certified copy of any return or report in connection
2 with his or her tax, (b) the publication of statistics so classified as
3 to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and the
4 items thereof, (c) the inspection by the Attorney General, other legal
5 representative of the state, or county attorney of the reports or returns
6 of any taxpayer when either (i) information on the reports or returns is
7 considered by the Attorney General to be relevant to any action or
8 proceeding instituted by the taxpayer or against whom an action or
9 proceeding is being considered or has been commenced by any state agency
10 or the county or (ii) the taxpayer has instituted an action to review the
11 tax based thereon or an action or proceeding against the taxpayer for

13 (b) For purposes of this subsection:
14 (i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a
15 person;
16 (ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
17 protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and

23 its tax calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without
24 retaining the personally identifiable information of consumers.
25 (d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined
26 sales and use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only

28 (i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the

30 (ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained
31 to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to

1 exempt purchasers;
2 (iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
3 information practices, including what information it collects, how it
4 collects the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at

6 to member states. Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy
7 policy statement accessible by the public on the website of the certified
8 service provider;
9 (iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
10 information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure
11 the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a
12 consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased;
13 and
14 (v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
15 safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
16 unauthorized access and disclosure.
17 (e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers,
18 including exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the
19 collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information.
20 (f) When any personally identifiable information that has been
21 collected and retained is no longer required for the purposes set forth
22 in subdivision (16)(d)(iv) of this section, such information shall no
23 longer be retained by the member states.
24 (g) When personally identifiable information regarding an individual
25 is retained by or on behalf of the state, it shall provide reasonable
26 access by such individual to his or her own information in the state's
27 possession and a right to correct any inaccurately recorded information.
28 (h) If anyone other than a member state, or a person authorized by
29 that state's law or the agreement, seeks to discover personally
30 identifiable information, the state from whom the information is sought
31 should make a reasonable and timely effort to notify the individual of
-18-

1 such request.
2 (i) This privacy policy is subject to enforcement by the Attorney
3 General.

22 amended to read:
23 77-27,143 (1) The administration of all sales and use taxes adopted
24 under the Local Option Revenue Act shall be by the Tax Commissioner who
25 may prescribe forms and adopt and promulgate reasonable rules and
26 regulations in conformity with the act for the making of returns and for
27 the ascertainment, assessment, and collection of taxes imposed under such
28 act. The incorporated municipality shall furnish a certified copy of the
29 adopting or repealing ordinance to the Tax Commissioner in accordance
30 with such rules and regulations as he or she may adopt and promulgate.
31 For ordinances passed after October 1, 1969, the effective date shall be
-26-

2025 2025
1 the first day of the next calendar quarter which is at least one hundred
2 twenty days following receipt by the Tax Commissioner of the certified
3 copy of the ordinance. The Tax Commissioner shall provide at least sixty
4 days' notice of the change in tax to retailers. Notice shall be provided
5 to retailers within the municipality. Notice to retailers may be provided
6 through the website of the Department of Revenue or by other electronic
7 means.
8 (2) For ordinances containing a termination date and passed after
9 October 1, 1986, the termination date shall be the first day of a
10 calendar quarter. The incorporated municipality shall furnish a certified
11 statement to the Tax Commissioner no more than one hundred eighty days
12 and at least one hundred twenty days prior to the termination date that
13 the termination date stated in the ordinance is still valid. If the
14 certified statement is not furnished within the prescribed time, the tax
15 shall remain in effect, and the Tax Commissioner shall continue to
16 collect the tax until the first day of the calendar quarter which is at
17 least one hundred twenty days after receipt of the certified statement
18 notwithstanding the termination date stated in the ordinance. The Tax
19 Commissioner shall provide at least sixty days' notice of the termination
20 of the tax to retailers. Notice shall be provided to retailers within the
21 municipality. Notice to retailers may be provided through the website of
22 the department or by other electronic means.
23 (3) For sales and use tax purposes only, local jurisdiction boundary
24 changes apply only on the first day of a calendar quarter after a minimum
25 of one hundred twenty days' notice to the Tax Commissioner and sixty
26 days' notice to sellers.
27 (4) The state shall provide and maintain a database that describes
28 boundary changes for all local taxing jurisdictions. This database shall
29 include a description of any change and the effective date of the change
30 for sales and use tax purposes.
31 (5) The state shall provide and maintain a database of all sales and
-27-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 use tax rates for all of the local jurisdictions levying taxes within the
2 state. For the identification of counties, cities, and villages, codes
3 corresponding to the rates shall be provided according to Federal
4 Information Processing Standards as developed by the National Institute
5 of Standards and Technology.
6 (6) The state shall provide and maintain a database that assigns
7 each five-digit and nine-digit zip code within the state to the proper
8 tax rates and jurisdictions. For purposes of the streamlined sales and
9 use tax agreement, the database shall apply the lowest combined tax rate
10 imposed in the nine-digit zip code area if the area includes more than
11 one tax rate in any level of taxing jurisdictions, and the database shall
12 apply the highest combined tax rate imposed in the five-digit zip code
13 area if the area includes more than one tax rate in any level of taxing
14 jurisdictions. If a nine-digit zip code designation is not available for
15 a street address or if a seller is unable to determine the nine-digit zip
16 code designation applicable to a purchase after exercising due diligence
17 to determine the designation, the seller or certified service provider
18 may apply the rate for the five-digit zip code area. For purposes of this
19 section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a seller or certified
20 service provider has exercised due diligence if the seller has attempted
21 to determine the nine-digit zip code designation by utilizing software
22 approved by the governing board that makes this designation from the
23 street address and the five-digit zip code applicable to a purchase.
24 (7) For purposes of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
25 state may provide address-based boundary database records for assigning
26 taxing jurisdictions and their associated rates which shall be in
27 addition to the requirements of subsection (6) of this section. The
28 database records shall be in the same approved format as the database
29 records pursuant to subsection (6) of this section and shall meet the
30 requirements developed pursuant to the federal Mobile Telecommunications
31 Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C. 119(a), as such act existed on January 1, 2003.
-28-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 The governing board may allow a member state to require sellers that
2 register under the agreement to use an address-based boundary database
3 provided by that member state. If any member state develops an address-
4 based boundary database pursuant to the agreement, a seller or certified
5 service provider may use those database records in place of the five-
6 digit and nine-digit zip code database records provided for in subsection
7 (6) of this section. If a seller or certified service provider is unable
8 to determine the applicable rate and jurisdiction using an address-based
9 boundary database after exercising due diligence, the seller or certified
10 service provider may apply the nine-digit zip code designation applicable
11 to a purchase. If a nine-digit zip code designation is not available for
12 a street address or if a seller or certified service provider is unable
13 to determine the nine-digit zip code designation applicable to a purchase
14 after exercising due diligence to determine the designation, the seller
15 or certified service provider may apply the rate for the five-digit zip
16 code area. For the purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable
17 presumption that a seller or certified service provider has exercised due
18 diligence if the seller or certified service provider has attempted to
19 determine the tax rate and jurisdiction by utilizing software approved by
20 the governing board that makes this assignment from the address and zip
21 code information applicable to the purchase.
22 (8) The state may certify vendor-provided address-based boundary
23 databases for assigning tax rates and jurisdictions. The databases shall
24 be in the same approved format as the database records pursuant to
25 subsection (7) of this section and shall meet the requirements developed
26 pursuant to the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C.
27 119(a) as such act existed on January 1, 2003. If a state certifies a
28 vendor-provided address-based boundary database, a seller or certified
29 service provider may use that database in place of the database provided
30 for in subsection (6) or (7) of this section. Vendors providing address-
31 based boundary databases may request certification of their databases
-29-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 from the governing board. Certification by the governing board does not
2 replace the requirement that the databases be certified by the states
3 individually.
4 (9) Pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
5 state shall relieve retailers and certified service providers using
6 databases pursuant to subsection (6) or (7) of this section from
7 liability to the state and local jurisdictions for having charged and
8 collected the incorrect amount of sales or use tax resulting from the
9 retailer or certified service provider relying on erroneous data provided
10 by a member state on tax rates, boundaries, or taxing jurisdiction
11 assignments. After providing adequate notice determined by the governing
12 board, a member state that provides an address-based boundary database
13 for assigning taxing jurisdictions pursuant to subsection (7) or (8) of
14 this section may cease providing liability relief for errors resulting
15 from the reliance on the database provided by the member state under the
16 provisions of subsection (6) of this section. If a seller demonstrates
17 that requiring the use of the address-based boundary database would
18 create an undue hardship, the state and the governing board may extend
19 the relief of liability to such seller for a designated period of time.
20 (10) The databases provided for in this section shall be in a
21 downloadable format approved by the governing board pursuant to the
22 streamlined sales and use tax agreement. The databases may be directly
23 provided by the state or provided by a vendor as designated by the state.
24 A database provided by a vendor as designated by a state shall be
25 applicable to and subject to all provisions of this section. The
26 databases shall be provided at no cost to the user of the database. The
27 provisions of subsections (6) and (7) of this section do not apply when
28 the purchased product is received by the purchaser at the business
29 location of the seller.
30 (11) A seller that did not have a requirement to register in this
31 state prior to registering pursuant to the agreement or a certified
-30-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
1 service provider shall not be required to collect sales or use taxes for
2 a state until the first day of the calendar quarter commencing more than
3 sixty days after the state has provided the databases required by this
4 section.
