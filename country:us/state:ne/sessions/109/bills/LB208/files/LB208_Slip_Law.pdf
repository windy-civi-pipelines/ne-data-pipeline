Approved by the Governor February 25, 2025
Introduced by von Gillern, 4.
A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to revenue and taxation; to amend sections
77-2712.03 and 77-27,143, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and
sections 77-2708, 77-2711, 77-2715.07, 77-27,241, 77-7012, and 77-7203,
Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024; to change provisions
relating to sales tax collection fees, confidentiality of sales tax
information, the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, a database for
sales tax zip code information, annual limits for certain tax credits, and
certain tax credits for parents and legal guardians; to harmonize
provisions; and to repeal the original sections.
Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Section 77-2708, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
77-2708 (1)(a) The sales and use taxes imposed by the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967 shall be due and payable to the Tax Commissioner monthly on or before
the twentieth day of the month next succeeding each monthly period unless
otherwise provided pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967.
(b)(i) On or before the twentieth day of the month following each monthly
period or such other period as the Tax Commissioner may require, a return for
such period, along with all taxes due, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner
in such form and content as the Tax Commissioner may prescribe and containing
such information as the Tax Commissioner deems necessary for the proper
administration of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. The Tax Commissioner, if he
or she deems it necessary in order to insure payment to or facilitate the
collection by the state of the amount of sales or use taxes due, may require
returns and payment of the amount of such taxes for periods other than monthly
periods in the case of a particular seller, retailer, or purchaser, as the case
may be. The Tax Commissioner shall by rule and regulation require reports and
tax payments from sellers, retailers, or purchasers depending on their yearly
tax liability. Except as required by the streamlined sales and use tax
agreement, annual returns shall be required if such sellers', retailers', or
purchasers' yearly tax liability is less than nine hundred dollars, quarterly
returns shall be required if their yearly tax liability is nine hundred dollars
or more and less than three thousand dollars, and monthly returns shall be
required if their yearly tax liability is three thousand dollars or more. The
Tax Commissioner shall have the discretion to allow an annual return for
seasonal retailers, even when their yearly tax liability exceeds the amounts
listed in this subdivision.
The Tax Commissioner may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
allow annual, semiannual, or quarterly returns for any retailer making monthly
remittances or payments of sales and use taxes by electronic funds transfer or
for any retailer remitting tax to the state pursuant to the streamlined sales
and use tax agreement. Such rules and regulations may establish a method of
determining the amount of the payment that will result in substantially all of
the tax liability being paid each quarter. At least once each year, the
difference between the amount paid and the amount due shall be reconciled. If
the difference is more than ten percent of the amount paid, a penalty of fifty
percent of the unpaid amount shall be imposed.
(ii) For purposes of the sales tax, a return shall be filed by every
retailer liable for collection from a purchaser and payment to the state of the
tax, except that a combined sales tax return may be filed for all licensed
locations which are subject to common ownership. For purposes of this
subdivision, common ownership means the same person or persons own eighty
percent or more of each licensed location. For purposes of the use tax, a
return shall be filed by every retailer engaged in business in this state and
by every person who has purchased property, the storage, use, or other
consumption of which is subject to the use tax, but who has not paid the use
tax due to a retailer required to collect the tax.
(iii) The Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the
person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent but
need not be verified by oath.
(iv) A taxpayer who keeps his or her regular books and records on a cash
basis, an accrual basis, or any generally recognized accounting basis which
correctly reflects the operation of the business may file the sales and use tax
returns required by the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 on the same accounting
basis that is used for the regular books and records, except that on credit,
conditional, and installment sales, the retailer who keeps his or her books on
an accrual basis may report such sales on the cash basis and pay the tax upon
the collections made during each month. If a taxpayer transfers, sells,
assigns, or otherwise disposes of an account receivable, he or she shall be
deemed to have received the full balance of the consideration for the original
sale and shall be liable for the remittance of the sales tax on the balance of
the total sale price not previously reported, except that such transfer, sale,
-1-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
assignment, or other disposition of an account receivable by a retailer to a
subsidiary shall not be deemed to require the retailer to pay the sales tax on
the credit sale represented by the account transferred prior to the time the
customer makes payment on such account. If the subsidiary does not obtain a
Nebraska sales tax permit, the taxpayer shall obtain a surety bond in favor of
the State of Nebraska to insure payment of the tax and any interest and penalty
imposed thereon under this section in an amount not less than two times the
amount of tax payable on outstanding accounts receivable held by the subsidiary
as of the end of the prior calendar year. Failure to obtain either a sales tax
permit or a surety bond in accordance with this section shall result in the
payment on the next required filing date of all sales taxes not previously
remitted. When the retailer has adopted one basis or the other of reporting
credit, conditional, or installment sales and paying the tax thereon, he or she
will not be permitted to change from that basis without first having notified
the Tax Commissioner.
(c) Except as provided in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
taxpayer required to file the return shall deliver or mail any required return
together with a remittance of the net amount of the tax due to the office of
the Tax Commissioner on or before the required filing date. Failure to file the
return, filing after the required filing date, failure to remit the net amount
of the tax due, or remitting the net amount of the tax due after the required
filing date shall be cause for a penalty, in addition to interest, of ten
percent of the amount of tax not paid by the required filing date or twenty-
five dollars, whichever is greater, unless the penalty is being collected under
subdivision (1)(i), (1)(j)(i), or (1)(k)(i) of section 77-2703 by a county
treasurer or the Department of Motor Vehicles, in which case the penalty shall
be five dollars.
(d) The taxpayer shall deduct and withhold, from the taxes otherwise due
from him or her on his or her tax return, three percent of the first five
thousand dollars remitted each month to reimburse himself or herself for the
cost of collecting the tax. Taxpayers filing a combined return as allowed by
subdivision (1)(b)(ii) of this subsection shall compute such collection fees on
the basis of the receipts and liability of each licensed location. If a model 1
seller's sales and use tax functions are performed by a certified service
provider and the certified service provider is compensated pursuant to the
streamlined sales and use tax agreement for performing such functions, then the
model 1 seller shall not receive any collection fees under this subdivision.
(e) A retailer that makes sales into Nebraska using a multivendor
marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to collect and remit sales
taxes to Nebraska with regard to any sales taxes collected and remitted by the
multivendor marketplace platform. Such a retailer must include all sales into
Nebraska in its gross receipts in its return, but may claim credit for any
sales taxes collected and remitted by the multivendor marketplace platform with
respect to such retailer's sales. Such retailer is liable for the sales tax due
on sales into Nebraska as provided in section 77-2704.35.
(f) A multivendor marketplace platform is relieved of its obligation to
collect and remit the correct amount of state and local sales taxes to Nebraska
to the extent that the multivendor marketplace platform can establish that the
error was due to insufficient or incorrect information given to the multivendor
marketplace platform by the seller and relied on by the multivendor marketplace
platform. This subdivision shall not apply if the multivendor marketplace
platform and the seller are related persons under either section 267(b) or (c)
or section 707(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or if the seller is also
the multivendor marketplace platform operator.
(2)(a) If the Tax Commissioner determines that any sales or use tax
amount, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, has been erroneously
or illegally collected or computed, or has been paid and the purchaser
qualifies for a refund under section 77-2708.01, the Tax Commissioner shall set
forth that fact in his or her records and the excess amount collected or paid
may be credited on any sales, use, or income tax amounts then due and payable
from the person under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967. Any balance may be
refunded to the person by whom it was paid or his or her successors,
administrators, or executors.
(b) No refund shall be allowed unless a claim therefor is filed with the
Tax Commissioner by the person who made the overpayment or his or her attorney,
executor, or administrator within three years from the required filing date
following the close of the period for which the overpayment was made, within
six months after any determination becomes final under section 77-2709, or
within six months from the date of overpayment with respect to such
determinations, whichever of these three periods expires later, unless the
credit relates to a period for which a waiver has been given. Failure to file a
claim within the time prescribed in this subsection shall constitute a waiver
of any demand against the state on account of overpayment.
(c) Every claim shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner and shall state the specific amount and grounds upon which the
claim is founded. No refund shall be made in any amount less than two dollars.
(d) The Tax Commissioner shall allow or disallow a claim within one
hundred eighty days after it has been filed. A request for a hearing shall
constitute a waiver of the one-hundred-eighty-day period. The claimant and the
Tax Commissioner may also agree to extend the one-hundred-eighty-day period. If
a hearing has not been requested and the Tax Commissioner has neither allowed
nor disallowed a claim within either the one hundred eighty days or the period
agreed to by the claimant and the Tax Commissioner, the claim shall be deemed
-2-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
to have been allowed.
(e) Within thirty days after disallowing any claim in whole or in part,
the Tax Commissioner shall serve notice of his or her action on the claimant in
the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.
(f) Within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of the Tax
Commissioner's action upon a claim filed pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967, the action of the Tax Commissioner shall be final unless the taxpayer
seeks review of the Tax Commissioner's determination as provided in section
77-27,127.
(g) Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any sum erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty collected without authority, or
of any sum which was excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, interest
shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such credit or refund at the rate
specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted,
from the date such sum was paid or from the date the return was required to be
filed, whichever date is later, to the date of the allowance of the refund or,
in the case of a credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit
is allowed, but in the case of a voluntary and unrequested payment in excess of
actual tax liability or a refund under section 77-2708.01, no interest shall be
allowed when such excess is refunded or credited.
(h) No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the
recovery of any amount alleged to have been erroneously or illegally determined
or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed.
(i) The Tax Commissioner may recover any refund or part thereof which is
erroneously made and any credit or part thereof which is erroneously allowed by
issuing a deficiency determination within one year from the date of refund or
credit or within the period otherwise allowed for issuing a deficiency
determination, whichever expires later.
(j)(i) Credit shall be allowed to the retailer, contractor, or
repairperson for sales or use taxes paid pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act
of 1967 on any deduction taken that is attributed to bad debts not including
interest. Bad debt has the same meaning as in 26 U.S.C. 166, as such section
existed on January 1, 2003. However, the amount calculated pursuant to 26
U.S.C. 166 shall be adjusted to exclude: Financing charges or interest; sales
or use taxes charged on the purchase price; uncollectible amounts on property
that remains in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is
paid; and expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt and repossessed
property.
(ii) Bad debts may be deducted on the return for the period during which
the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and
records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. A
claimant who is not required to file federal income tax returns may deduct a
bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt is written off
as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for
a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was
required to file a federal income tax return.
(iii) If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the debt is subsequently
collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so collected must be paid
and reported on the return filed for the period in which the collection is
made.
(iv) When the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales for
the period during which the bad debt is written off, a refund claim may be
filed within the otherwise applicable statute of limitations for refund claims.
The statute of limitations shall be measured from the due date of the return on
which the bad debt could first be claimed.
(v) If filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified service
provider, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the retailer, any bad
debt allowance provided by this section. The certified service provider shall
credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt allowance or refund received
to the retailer.
(vi) For purposes of reporting a payment received on a previously claimed
bad debt, any payments made on a debt or account are applied first
proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and the sales
tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other charges.
(vii) In situations in which the books and records of the party claiming
the bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts among the member
states in the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the state shall permit
the allocation.
(3) Beginning July 1, 2020, if a refund claim under this section involves
a refund of a tax imposed under the Local Option Revenue Act or section 13-319,
13-2813, or 77-6403 and the amount of such tax to be refunded is at least five
thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected city, village,
county, or municipal county of such claim within twenty days after receiving
the claim. If the Tax Commissioner allows the claim and the refund of such tax
is at least five thousand dollars, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the
affected city, village, county, or municipal county of such refund and shall
give the city, village, county, or municipal county the option of having such
refund deducted from its tax proceeds in one lump sum or in twelve equal
monthly installments. The city, village, county, or municipal county shall make
its selection and shall certify the selection to the Tax Commissioner within
twenty days after receiving notice of the refund. The Tax Commissioner shall
then deduct such refund from the applicable tax proceeds in accordance with the
selection when he or she deducts refunds pursuant to section 13-324, 13-2814,
-3-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
or 77-6403 or subsection (1) of section 77-27,144, whichever is applicable.
This subsection shall not apply to any refund that is subject to subdivision
(2)(a) or (2)(b)(ii) or subsection (3) or (4) of section 77-27,144.
Sec. 2. Section 77-2711, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
77-2711 (1)(a) The Tax Commissioner shall enforce sections 77-2701.04 to
77-2713 and may prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and regulations relating to
the administration and enforcement of such sections.
(b) The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the extent to which any ruling or
regulation shall be applied without retroactive effect.
(2) The Tax Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors, investigators,
assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient administration of the
Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 and may delegate authority to his or her
representatives to conduct hearings, prescribe regulations, or perform any
other duties imposed by such act.
(3)(a) Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing, using, or
otherwise consuming in this state property purchased from a retailer shall keep
such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent papers in such form as
the Tax Commissioner may reasonably require.
(b) Every such seller, retailer, or person shall keep such records for not
less than three years from the making of such records unless the Tax
Commissioner in writing sooner authorized their destruction.
(4) The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by him or her
may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any person selling
property and any person liable for the use tax and may investigate the
character of the business of the person in order to verify the accuracy of any
return made or, if no return is made by the person, to ascertain and determine
the amount required to be paid. In the examination of any person selling
property or of any person liable for the use tax, an inquiry shall be made as
to the accuracy of the reporting of city and county sales and use taxes for
which the person is liable under the Local Option Revenue Act or sections
13-319, 13-324, 13-2813, and 77-6403 and the accuracy of the allocation made
between the various counties, cities, villages, and municipal counties of the
tax due. The Tax Commissioner may make or cause to be made copies of resale or
exemption certificates and may pay a reasonable amount to the person having
custody of the records for providing such copies.
(5) The taxpayer shall have the right to keep or store his or her records
at a point outside this state and shall make his or her records available to
the Tax Commissioner at all times.
(6) In administration of the use tax, the Tax Commissioner may require the
filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in his, her, or
their possession or custody information relating to sales of property, the
storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to the tax. The report
shall be filed when the Tax Commissioner requires and shall set forth the names
and addresses of purchasers of the property, the sales price of the property,
the date of sale, and such other information as the Tax Commissioner may
require.
(7) It shall be a Class I misdemeanor for the Tax Commissioner, or any
official or employee of the Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, or the
Department of Administrative Services, or any other person to make known in any
manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an
investigation of records and activities of any retailer or any other person
visited or examined in the discharge of official duty or the amount or source
of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth
or disclosed in any return, or to permit any return or copy thereof, or any
book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by
any person not connected with the Tax Commissioner. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to prohibit (a) the delivery to a taxpayer, his or her duly
authorized representative, or his or her successors, receivers, trustees,
executors, administrators, assignees, or guarantors, if directly interested, of
a certified copy of any return or report in connection with his or her tax, (b)
the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of
particular reports or returns and the items thereof, (c) the inspection by the
Attorney General, other legal representative of the state, or county attorney
of the reports or returns of any taxpayer when either (i) information on the
reports or returns is considered by the Attorney General to be relevant to any
action or proceeding instituted by the taxpayer or against whom an action or
proceeding is being considered or has been commenced by any state agency or the
county or (ii) the taxpayer has instituted an action to review the tax based
thereon or an action or proceeding against the taxpayer for collection of tax
or failure to comply with the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 is being considered
or has been commenced, (d) the furnishing of any information to the United
States Government or to states allowing similar privileges to the Tax
Commissioner, (e) the disclosure of information and records to a collection

77-377.04, (f) the disclosure to another party to a transaction of information
and records concerning the transaction between the taxpayer and the other
party, (g) the disclosure of information pursuant to section 77-27,195,

the Department of Labor necessary for the administration of the Employment
Security Law, the Contractor Registration Act, or the Employee Classification

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
the Tax Commissioner shall, upon written request, provide an individual

locations within the boundaries of the requesting municipality. Any written
request pursuant to this subsection shall provide the Department of Revenue
with no less than ten business days to prepare the sales and use tax returns
and sales and use tax return information requested. The individual certified
under subdivision (b) of this subsection shall review such returns and return
information only upon the premises of the department, except that such
limitation shall not apply if the certifying municipality has an agreement in
effect under the Nebraska Advantage Transformational Tourism and Redevelopment
Act. In such case, the individual certified under subdivision (b) of this

(d) Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection shall be
guilty of a Class I misdemeanor.
(e) The Department of Revenue shall not be held liable by any person for

(15) In all proceedings under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, the Tax
Commissioner may act for and on behalf of the people of the State of Nebraska.
The Tax Commissioner in his or her discretion may waive all or part of any
penalties provided by the provisions of such act or interest on delinquent
taxes specified in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be
adjusted.
(16)(a) The purpose of this subsection is to set forth the state's policy
for the protection of the confidentiality rights of all participants in the
system operated pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement and of
the privacy interests of consumers who deal with model 1 sellers.
(b) For purposes of this subsection:
(i) Anonymous data means information that does not identify a person;
(ii) Confidential taxpayer information means all information that is
protected under a member state's laws, regulations, and privileges; and
(iii) Personally identifiable information means information that
identifies a person.
(c) The state agrees that a fundamental precept for model 1 sellers is to
preserve the privacy of consumers by protecting their anonymity. With very
limited exceptions, a certified service provider shall perform its tax
calculation, remittance, and reporting functions without retaining the
personally identifiable information of consumers.
(d) The governing board of the member states in the streamlined sales and
use tax agreement may certify a certified service provider only if that
certified service provider certifies that:
(i) Its system has been designed and tested to ensure that the fundamental
precept of anonymity is respected;
(ii) Personally identifiable information is only used and retained to the
extent necessary for the administration of model 1 with respect to exempt
purchasers;
(iii) It provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its
information practices, including what information it collects, how it collects
the information, how it uses the information, how long, if at all, it retains
the information, and whether it discloses the information to member states.
Such notice shall be satisfied by a written privacy policy statement accessible
by the public on the website of the certified service provider;
(iv) Its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable
information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure the
validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a consumer's
status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased; and
(v) It provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative
safeguards so as to protect personally identifiable information from
unauthorized access and disclosure.
(e) The state shall provide public notification to consumers, including
-6-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
exempt purchasers, of the state's practices relating to the collection, use,
and retention of personally identifiable information.

the Local Option Revenue Act shall be by the Tax Commissioner who may prescribe
forms and adopt and promulgate reasonable rules and regulations in conformity
with the act for the making of returns and for the ascertainment, assessment,
and collection of taxes imposed under such act. The incorporated municipality
shall furnish a certified copy of the adopting or repealing ordinance to the
Tax Commissioner in accordance with such rules and regulations as he or she may
adopt and promulgate. For ordinances passed after October 1, 1969, the
effective date shall be the first day of the next calendar quarter which is at
least one hundred twenty days following receipt by the Tax Commissioner of the
certified copy of the ordinance. The Tax Commissioner shall provide at least
sixty days' notice of the change in tax to retailers. Notice shall be provided
to retailers within the municipality. Notice to retailers may be provided
through the website of the Department of Revenue or by other electronic means.
(2) For ordinances containing a termination date and passed after October
1, 1986, the termination date shall be the first day of a calendar quarter. The
-9-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
incorporated municipality shall furnish a certified statement to the Tax
Commissioner no more than one hundred eighty days and at least one hundred
twenty days prior to the termination date that the termination date stated in
the ordinance is still valid. If the certified statement is not furnished
within the prescribed time, the tax shall remain in effect, and the Tax
Commissioner shall continue to collect the tax until the first day of the
calendar quarter which is at least one hundred twenty days after receipt of the
certified statement notwithstanding the termination date stated in the
ordinance. The Tax Commissioner shall provide at least sixty days' notice of
the termination of the tax to retailers. Notice shall be provided to retailers
within the municipality. Notice to retailers may be provided through the
website of the department or by other electronic means.
(3) For sales and use tax purposes only, local jurisdiction boundary
changes apply only on the first day of a calendar quarter after a minimum of
one hundred twenty days' notice to the Tax Commissioner and sixty days' notice
to sellers.
(4) The state shall provide and maintain a database that describes
boundary changes for all local taxing jurisdictions. This database shall
include a description of any change and the effective date of the change for
sales and use tax purposes.
(5) The state shall provide and maintain a database of all sales and use
tax rates for all of the local jurisdictions levying taxes within the state.
For the identification of counties, cities, and villages, codes corresponding
to the rates shall be provided according to Federal Information Processing
Standards as developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
(6) The state shall provide and maintain a database that assigns each
five-digit and nine-digit zip code within the state to the proper tax rates and
jurisdictions. For purposes of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the
database shall apply the lowest combined tax rate imposed in the nine-digit zip
code area if the area includes more than one tax rate in any level of taxing
jurisdictions, and the database shall apply the highest combined tax rate
imposed in the five-digit zip code area if the area includes more than one tax
rate in any level of taxing jurisdictions. If a nine-digit zip code designation
is not available for a street address or if a seller is unable to determine the
nine-digit zip code designation applicable to a purchase after exercising due
diligence to determine the designation, the seller or certified service
provider may apply the rate for the five-digit zip code area. For purposes of
this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a seller or certified
service provider has exercised due diligence if the seller has attempted to
determine the nine-digit zip code designation by utilizing software approved by
the governing board that makes this designation from the street address and the
five-digit zip code applicable to a purchase.
(7) For purposes of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the state
may provide address-based boundary database records for assigning taxing
jurisdictions and their associated rates which shall be in addition to the
requirements of subsection (6) of this section. The database records shall be
in the same approved format as the database records pursuant to subsection (6)
of this section and shall meet the requirements developed pursuant to the
federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C. 119(a), as such act
existed on January 1, 2003. The governing board may allow a member state to
require sellers that register under the agreement to use an address-based
boundary database provided by that member state. If any member state develops
an address-based boundary database pursuant to the agreement, a seller or
certified service provider may use those database records in place of the five-
digit and nine-digit zip code database records provided for in subsection (6)
of this section. If a seller or certified service provider is unable to
determine the applicable rate and jurisdiction using an address-based boundary
database after exercising due diligence, the seller or certified service
provider may apply the nine-digit zip code designation applicable to a
purchase. If a nine-digit zip code designation is not available for a street
address or if a seller or certified service provider is unable to determine the
nine-digit zip code designation applicable to a purchase after exercising due
diligence to determine the designation, the seller or certified service
provider may apply the rate for the five-digit zip code area. For the purposes
of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a seller or certified
service provider has exercised due diligence if the seller or certified service
provider has attempted to determine the tax rate and jurisdiction by utilizing
software approved by the governing board that makes this assignment from the
address and zip code information applicable to the purchase.
(8) The state may certify vendor-provided address-based boundary databases
for assigning tax rates and jurisdictions. The databases shall be in the same
approved format as the database records pursuant to subsection (7) of this
section and shall meet the requirements developed pursuant to the federal
Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C. 119(a) as such act existed on
January 1, 2003. If a state certifies a vendor-provided address-based boundary
database, a seller or certified service provider may use that database in place
of the database provided for in subsection (6) or (7) of this section. Vendors
providing address-based boundary databases may request certification of their
databases from the governing board. Certification by the governing board does
not replace the requirement that the databases be certified by the states
individually.
(9) Pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, the state
shall relieve retailers and certified service providers using databases
-10-

LB208 LB208
2025 2025
pursuant to subsection (6) or (7) of this section from liability to the state
and local jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount
of sales or use tax resulting from the retailer or certified service provider
relying on erroneous data provided by a member state on tax rates, boundaries,
or taxing jurisdiction assignments. After providing adequate notice determined
by the governing board, a member state that provides an address-based boundary
database for assigning taxing jurisdictions pursuant to subsection (7) or (8)
of this section may cease providing liability relief for errors resulting from
the reliance on the database provided by the member state under the provisions
of subsection (6) of this section. If a seller demonstrates that requiring the
use of the address-based boundary database would create an undue hardship, the
state and the governing board may extend the relief of liability to such seller
for a designated period of time.
(10) The databases provided for in this section shall be in a downloadable
format approved by the governing board pursuant to the streamlined sales and
use tax agreement. The databases may be directly provided by the state or
provided by a vendor as designated by the state. A database provided by a
vendor as designated by a state shall be applicable to and subject to all
provisions of this section. The databases shall be provided at no cost to the
user of the database. The provisions of subsections (6) and (7) of this section
do not apply when the purchased product is received by the purchaser at the
business location of the seller.
(11) A seller that did not have a requirement to register in this state
prior to registering pursuant to the agreement or a certified service provider
shall not be required to collect sales or use taxes for a state until the first
day of the calendar quarter commencing more than sixty days after the state has
provided the databases required by this section.
