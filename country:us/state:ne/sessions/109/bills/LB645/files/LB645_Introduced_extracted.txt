1 Section 1. Section 79-966, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 79-966 (1)(a) On the basis of all data in the possession of the
4 retirement board, including such mortality and other tables as are
5 recommended by the actuary engaged by the retirement board and adopted by
6 the retirement board, the retirement board shall annually, on or before
7 July 1, determine the state deposit to be made by the state in the School
8 Retirement Fund for that fiscal year. The amount of such state deposit
9 shall be determined pursuant to section 79-966.01. The retirement board
10 shall thereupon certify the amount of such state deposit, and on the
11 warrant of the Director of Administrative Services, the State Treasurer
12 shall, as of July 1 of such year, transfer from funds appropriated by the
13 state for that purpose to the School Retirement Fund the amount of such
14 state deposit.
15 (b) Beginning July 1, 2016, the contingent state transfer described
16 in this subsection shall be calculated as a percent of compensation of
17 all members of the retirement system. For any year in which a deposit is
18 made to the School Retirement Fund under this subsection, if the actuary
19 for a retirement system provided for under the Class V School Employees
20 Retirement Act determines that the actuarially required contribution
21 rate, for the fiscal year of the retirement system that begins before the
22 state deposit, exceeds the rate of all contributions required pursuant to
23 the Class V School Employees Retirement Act, using the amortization
24 period specified in section 79-966.01, the Class V district school board
25 may request a public hearing of the Appropriations Committee of the
26 Legislature to ask the state to transfer to the Class V school district
27 for transfer to the funds of the retirement system provided for under the
28 Class V School Employees Retirement Act an amount determined by
29 multiplying the compensation of all members of such retirement system by
30 the lesser of the percent of compensation transferred into the School
31 Retirement Fund under this subsection or the percent of compensation of

7 percent specified in subsection (2) of this section for the amount
8 required by subsection (2) of section 79-916 to be transferred to the
9 Class V school district, which shall transfer such amount to the funds of

23 compensation of all members of the retirement system;

25 ninety-two percent or greater and less than ninety-four percent, an
26 amount equal to one and six-tenths of one percent of the compensation of
27 all members of the retirement system;

3 amount equal to eight-tenths of one percent of the compensation of all
4 members of the retirement system;
5 (e) If the actuarially funded ratio of the School Retirement Fund is

7 amount equal to four-tenths of one percent of the compensation of all
8 members of the retirement system; and
9 (f) If the actuarially funded ratio of the School Retirement Fund is
10 one hundred percent or greater, the state shall not be required to
11 transfer an amount under this subsection.

13 subsections (1) and (2) of this section, beginning on July 1, 2005, and
14 each fiscal year thereafter for employees who become members prior to
15 July 1, 2016, the state shall transfer into the Service Annuity Fund such
16 amounts as may be necessary to pay the normal cost and amortize the
17 unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the service annuity benefit
18 established pursuant to sections 79-933 and 79-952 as accrued through the
