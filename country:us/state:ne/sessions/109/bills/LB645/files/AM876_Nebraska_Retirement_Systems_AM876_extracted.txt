8 79-966 (1)(a) On the basis of all data in the possession of the
9 retirement board, including such mortality and other tables as are
10 recommended by the actuary engaged by the retirement board and adopted by
11 the retirement board, the retirement board shall annually, on or before
12 July 1, determine the state deposit to be made by the state in the School
13 Retirement Fund for that fiscal year. The amount of such state deposit
14 shall be determined pursuant to section 79-966.01. The retirement board
15 shall thereupon certify the amount of such state deposit, and on the

28 the Class V School Employees Retirement Act, using the amortization
29 period specified in section 79-966.01, the Class V district school board
30 may request a public hearing of the Appropriations Committee of the

6 the members of the retirement system provided for under the Class V
7 School Employees Retirement Act needed to meet the actuarially required
8 contribution rate for such system, using the amortization period
9 specified in section 79-966.01. Any additional amount of transfer so

14 subsections (1) and (2) of this section, beginning on July 1, 2005, and
15 each fiscal year thereafter for employees who become members prior to

17 amounts as may be necessary to pay the normal cost and amortize the
18 unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the service annuity benefit
19 established pursuant to sections 79-933 and 79-952 as accrued through the
20 end of the previous fiscal year of the school employees who are members
21 of the retirement system established pursuant to the Class V School
