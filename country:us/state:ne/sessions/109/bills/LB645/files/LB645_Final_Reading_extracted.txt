1 Section 1. Section 79-916, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 79-916 (1)(a) On July 1, 2004, the board shall transfer from the
4 School Retirement Fund to the Service Annuity Fund an amount equal to the
5 funded ratio of the retirement system which is equal to the market value
6 of the retirement system assets divided by the actuarial accrued
7 liability of the retirement system, times the actuarial accrued liability
8 of the service annuity, as determined pursuant to section 79-966.01, of
9 the employees who are members of the retirement system established
10 pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement Act. Beginning July
11 1, 2013, such actuarial accrued liability shall be determined for each
12 employee on a level percentage of salary basis. On or before July 1 of
13 each fiscal year, the state shall transfer into the Service Annuity Fund
14 such amounts as may be necessary to pay the normal cost and amortize the
15 unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the service annuity, as
16 determined pursuant to section 79-966.01, as of the end of the previous
17 fiscal year of the employees who are members of the retirement system
18 established pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement Act.
19 Based on the fiscal year of the retirement system established pursuant to
20 the Class V School Employees Retirement Act, the administrator of such
21 system shall provide all membership information needed for the actuary
22 engaged by the retirement board to determine the normal cost and the
23 amortization payment of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability, as
24 determined pursuant to section 79-966.01, to be paid by the state to the
25 Service Annuity Fund each fiscal year as required by this subdivision.
26 (b) At the time of retirement of any employee who is a member of the
27 retirement system established pursuant to the Class V School Employees
28 Retirement Act and who was hired prior to July 1, 2016, the retirement
29 board shall, upon receipt of a certification of the administrator of such
30 retirement system of the name, identification number, date of birth,
31 retirement date, last date of employment, type of retirement, and number
-2-

2025 2025
1 of years of service credited to such eligible employee at the date of
2 retirement, transfer from the Service Annuity Fund to the Class V school
3 district for transfer to the retirement system the actuarial accrued
4 liability of the service annuity to be paid to the Class V school
5 district by the state for transfer to the eligible employee for the years
6 of service thus certified as provided for members of the School Employees
7 Retirement System of the State of Nebraska under sections 79-933 and
8 79-952. Such transfer of the actuarial accrued liability to the Class V
9 school district for transfer to the retirement system established
10 pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement Act shall be in lieu
11 of the payment of the service annuity to which the employee would be
12 entitled.
13 (c) The Service Annuity Fund is created. The fund shall consist of
14 the amounts paid by the state and transferred from the School Retirement
15 Fund to the Class V school district for transfer to the retirement system
16 pursuant to this section to pay the service annuity to the Class V school
17 district for transfer to employees who are members of the retirement
18 system established pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement
19 Act. Any money in the Service Annuity Fund available for investment shall
20 be invested by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska
21 Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
22 (2)(a) For each fiscal year prior to July 1, 2025, in (2) In
23 addition to the transfer of the actuarial accrued liability of the
24 service annuity pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the state
25 shall also transfer to the funds of the Class V school district for
26 transfer to the district's retirement system an amount determined by
27 multiplying the compensation of all members of such retirement system by
28 the percent specified in subsection (2) of section 79-966 for determining
29 the amount of the state's payment to the School Retirement Fund plus the
30 amount determined under subdivision (1)(b) of section 79-966. The
31 transfer shall be made annually on or before July 1 of each fiscal year.

2025 2025
1 (b) For each fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, in addition to the
2 transfer pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the state shall also
3 transfer to the funds of the Class V school district for transfer to the
4 district's retirement system an amount equal to two percent of the
5 compensation of all members of such retirement system plus the amount
6 determined under subdivision (1)(b) of section 79-966. The transfer shall
7 be made annually on or before July 1 of each fiscal year.
8 (c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the state transfer of
9 two percent of the compensation of all members of the district's
10 retirement system does not mean that the state assumes any additional
11 financial responsibility or liability for funding obligations of the
12 retirement system that remain the responsibility of the district as
13 described in the Class V School Employees Retirement Act.
14 Sec. 2. Section 79-958, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 79-958 (1)(a) (1) Beginning on September 1, 2012, and prior to July
17 1, 2025, for the purpose of providing the funds to pay for formula
18 annuities, every employee shall be required to deposit in the School
19 Retirement Fund nine and seventy-eight hundredths of one percent of
20 compensation. Such deposits shall be transmitted at the same time and in
21 the same manner as required employer contributions.
22 (b) Beginning in 2025 and each year thereafter, the employee
23 contribution rate shall be calculated as of July 1 and based on the
24 funded ratio of the actuarial value of assets in the School Retirement
25 Fund in the most recent previous year as reported in the annual actuarial
26 valuation report for the retirement system prepared for the retirement
27 board pursuant to section 84-1503. Beginning on July 1, 2025, for the
28 purpose of providing the funds to pay for formula annuities, every
29 employee shall deposit the following amounts into the School Retirement
30 Fund:
31 (i) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
-4-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 School Retirement Fund is less than ninety-six percent, nine and three-
2 quarters of one percent of compensation;
3 (ii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
4 School Retirement Fund is ninety-six percent or greater and less than
5 ninety-eight percent, eight and three-quarters of one percent of
6 compensation;
7 (iii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
8 School Retirement Fund is ninety-eight percent or greater and less than
9 one hundred percent, eight percent of compensation; and
10 (iv) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
11 School Retirement Fund is one hundred percent or greater, seven and one-
12 quarter of one percent of compensation.
13 (c) Deposits under this subsection shall be transmitted at the same
14 time and in the same manner as required employer contributions.
15 (2) For the purpose of providing the funds to pay for formula
16 annuities, every employer shall be required to deposit in the School
17 Retirement Fund one hundred one percent of the required contributions of
18 the school employees of each employer. Such deposits shall be transmitted
19 to the retirement board at the same time and in the same manner as such
20 required employee contributions.
21 (3) The employer shall pick up the member contributions required by
22 this section for all compensation paid on or after January 1, 1986, and
23 the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions
24 pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code in determining
25 federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be included as gross
26 income of the member until such time as they are distributed or made
27 available. The contributions, although designated as member
28 contributions, shall be paid by the employer in lieu of member
29 contributions. The employer shall pay these member contributions from the
30 same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the member. The
31 employer shall pick up these contributions by a compensation deduction
-5-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 through a reduction in the cash compensation of the member. Member
2 contributions picked up shall be treated for all purposes of the School
3 Employees Retirement Act in the same manner and to the same extent as
4 member contributions made prior to the date picked up.
5 (4) The employer shall pick up the member contributions made through
6 irrevocable payroll deduction authorizations pursuant to sections 79-921
7 and 79-933.03 to 79-933.06, and the contributions so picked up shall be
8 treated as employer contributions in the same manner as contributions
9 picked up under subsection (3) of this section.
10 Sec. 3. Section 79-966, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 79-966 (1)(a) On the basis of all data in the possession of the
13 retirement board, including such mortality and other tables as are
14 recommended by the actuary engaged by the retirement board and adopted by
15 the retirement board, the retirement board shall annually, on or before
16 July 1, determine the state deposit to be made by the state in the School
17 Retirement Fund for that fiscal year. The amount of such state deposit
18 shall be determined pursuant to section 79-966.01. The retirement board
19 shall thereupon certify the amount of such state deposit, and on the
20 warrant of the Director of Administrative Services, the State Treasurer
21 shall, as of July 1 of such year, transfer from funds appropriated by the
22 state for that purpose to the School Retirement Fund the amount of such
23 state deposit.
24 (b) Beginning July 1, 2016, the contingent state transfer described
25 in this subsection shall be calculated as a percent of compensation of
26 all members of the retirement system. For any year in which a deposit is
27 made to the School Retirement Fund under this subsection, if the actuary
28 for a retirement system provided for under the Class V School Employees
29 Retirement Act determines that the actuarially required contribution
30 rate, for the fiscal year of the retirement system that begins before the
31 state deposit, exceeds the rate of all contributions required pursuant to
-6-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 the Class V School Employees Retirement Act, using the amortization
2 period specified in section 79-966.01, the Class V district school board
3 may request a public hearing of the Appropriations Committee of the
4 Legislature to ask the state to transfer to the Class V school district
5 for transfer to the funds of the retirement system provided for under the
6 Class V School Employees Retirement Act an amount determined by
7 multiplying the compensation of all members of such retirement system by
8 the lesser of the percent of compensation transferred into the School
9 Retirement Fund under this subsection or the percent of compensation of
10 the members of the retirement system provided for under the Class V
11 School Employees Retirement Act needed to meet the actuarially required
12 contribution rate for such system, using the amortization period
13 specified in section 79-966.01. Any additional amount of transfer so
14 calculated, recommended by the Appropriations Committee of the
15 Legislature, and approved by the Legislature, shall be added to the two
16 percent specified in subsection (2) of this section for the amount
17 required by subsection (2) of section 79-916 to be transferred to the
18 Class V school district, which shall transfer such amount to the funds of
19 the retirement system provided for under the Class V School Employees
20 Retirement Act.
21 (2)(a) (2) For each fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014, and prior to
22 July 1, 2025, in addition to the state transfers required by subsections
23 (1) and (3) of this section, the state shall transfer into the School
24 Retirement Fund an amount equal to two percent of the compensation of all
25 members of the retirement system.
26 (b) Beginning in 2025 and each year thereafter, the state
27 contribution rate under this subsection shall be calculated as of July 1
28 and based on the funded ratio of the actuarial value of assets in the
29 School Retirement Fund in the most recent previous year as reported in
30 the annual actuarial valuation report for the retirement system produced
31 for the retirement board pursuant to section 84-1503. In addition to the
-7-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 state transfers required by subsections (1) and (3) of this section, the
2 state shall deposit the following amounts into the School Retirement
3 Fund:
4 (i) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
5 School Retirement Fund is less than ninety-six percent, an amount equal
6 to two percent of the compensation of all members of the retirement
7 system;
8 (ii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
9 School Retirement Fund is ninety-six percent or greater and less than one
10 hundred percent, an amount equal to seven-tenths of one percent of the
11 compensation of all members of the retirement system; and
12 (iii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
13 School Retirement Fund is one hundred percent or greater, no transfer
14 shall be made under this subsection.
15 (3) In addition to the state deposits and transfers required by
16 subsections (1) and (2) of this section, beginning on July 1, 2005, and
17 each fiscal year thereafter for employees who become members prior to
18 July 1, 2016, the state shall transfer into the Service Annuity Fund such
19 amounts as may be necessary to pay the normal cost and amortize the
20 unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the service annuity benefit
21 established pursuant to sections 79-933 and 79-952 as accrued through the
22 end of the previous fiscal year of the school employees who are members
23 of the retirement system established pursuant to the Class V School
24 Employees Retirement Act.
25 Sec. 4. Section 81-2026, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 81-2026 (1)(a) Any officer qualified for an annuity as provided in
28 section 81-2025 for reasons other than disability shall be entitled to
29 receive a monthly annuity for the remainder of the officer's life. The
30 annuity payments shall continue until the end of the calendar month in
31 which the officer dies. The amount of the annuity shall be a percentage
-8-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 of the officer's final average monthly compensation. For retirement on or
2 after the fifty-fifth birthday of the member or on or after the fiftieth
3 birthday of a member who has been in the employ of the state for twenty-
4 five years, as calculated in section 81-2033, the percentage shall be
5 three percent multiplied by the number of years of creditable service, as
6 calculated in section 81-2033, except that the percentage shall never be
7 greater than seventy-five percent.
8 (b) For retirement pursuant to subsection (2) of section 81-2025 on
9 or after the fiftieth birthday of the member but prior to the fifty-fifth
10 birthday of the member who has been in the employ of the state for less
11 than twenty-five years, as calculated in section 81-2033, the annuity
12 which would apply if the member were age fifty-five at the date of
13 retirement shall be reduced by five-ninths of one percent for each month
14 by which the early retirement date precedes age fifty-five or for each
15 month by which the early retirement date precedes the date upon which the
16 member has served for twenty-five years, whichever is earlier. Any
17 officer who has completed thirty years of creditable service with the
18 Nebraska State Patrol shall have retirement benefits computed as if the
19 officer had reached age fifty-five.
20 (c) For purposes of this computation:
21 (i) For an officer who became a member prior to July 1, 2016, final
22 average monthly compensation means the sum of the officer's total
23 compensation during the three twelve-month periods of service as an
24 officer in which compensation was the greatest divided by thirty-six and:
25 (A) For any officer employed on or before January 4, 1979, the
26 officer's total compensation includes payments received for unused
27 vacation and sick leave accumulated during the final three years of
28 service; or
29 (B) For any officer employed after January 4, 1979, and prior to
30 July 1, 2016, the officer's total compensation includes payments received
31 for unused holiday compensatory time and unused compensatory time; and
-9-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 (ii) For an officer who became a member on or after July 1, 2016,
2 final average monthly compensation means the sum of the officer's total
3 compensation during the five twelve-month periods of service as an
4 officer in which compensation was the greatest divided by sixty and does
5 not include payments received for unused sick leave, unused vacation
6 leave, unused holiday compensatory time, unused compensatory time, or any
7 other type of unused leave, compensatory time, or similar benefits,
8 converted to cash payments. The five twelve-month periods used for
9 calculating an officer's final average monthly compensation ends with the
10 month during which the officer's final compensation is paid. In the
11 determination of compensation, that part of an officer's compensation for
12 the plan year which exceeds the officer's compensation for the preceding
13 plan year by more than eight percent during the capping period shall be
14 excluded. Such officer's compensation for the first plan year of the
15 capping period shall be compared to the officer's compensation received
16 for the plan year immediately preceding the capping period. For purposes
17 of this subdivision, capping period means the five plan years preceding
18 the officer's retirement date. The board may adopt and promulgate rules
19 and regulations for the implementation of this section, including rules
20 and regulations related to prorating, annualizing, or recalculating an
21 officer's final average monthly compensation for each plan year in the
22 capping period.
23 (2) Any officer qualified for an annuity as provided in section
24 81-2025 for reasons of disability shall be entitled to receive a monthly
25 annuity for the remainder of the period of disablement as provided in
26 sections 81-2028 to 81-2030. The amount of the annuity shall be fifty
27 percent of the officer's monthly compensation at the date of disablement
28 if the officer has completed seventeen or fewer years of creditable
29 service. If the officer has completed more than seventeen years of
30 creditable service, the amount of the annuity shall be three percent of
31 the final monthly compensation at the date of disablement multiplied by
-10-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 the total years of creditable service but not to exceed seventy-five
2 percent of the final average monthly compensation as defined in
3 subsection (1) of this section. The date of disablement shall be the date
4 on which the benefits as provided in section 81-2028 have been exhausted.
5 (3) Upon the death of an officer after retirement for reasons other
6 than disability, benefits shall be provided as a percentage of the amount
7 of the officer's annuity, calculated as follows:
8 (a) If there is a surviving spouse but no dependent child or
9 children of the officer under nineteen years of age, the surviving spouse
10 shall receive a benefit equal to:
11 (i) Prior to July 1, 2027, seventy-five percent of the amount of the
12 officer's annuity for the remainder of the surviving spouse's life; and
13 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2027, one hundred percent of the amount of
14 the officer's annuity for the remainder of the surviving spouse's life;
15 (b) If there is a surviving spouse and the surviving spouse has in
16 his or her care a dependent child or children of the officer under
17 nineteen years of age and there is no other dependent child or children
18 of the officer not in the care of the surviving spouse under nineteen
19 years of age, the benefit shall be equal to one hundred percent of the
20 officer's annuity. When there is no remaining dependent child of the
21 officer under nineteen years of age, the benefit shall be:
22 (i) Prior to July 1, 2027, seventy-five percent of the amount of the
23 officer's annuity to the surviving spouse for the remainder of the
24 surviving spouse's life; and
25 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2027, one hundred percent of the amount of
26 the officer's annuity to the surviving spouse for the remainder of the
27 surviving spouse's life;
28 (c) If there is a surviving spouse and the surviving spouse has in
29 his or her care a dependent child or children of the officer under
30 nineteen years of age or there is another dependent child or children of
31 the officer under nineteen years of age not in the care of the surviving
-11-
LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 spouse, the benefit shall be twenty-five percent of the amount of the
2 officer's annuity to the surviving spouse and seventy-five percent of the
3 amount of the officer's annuity to the dependent children of the officer
4 under nineteen years of age to be divided equally among such dependent
5 children but in no case shall the benefit received by a surviving spouse
6 and dependent children residing with such spouse be less than fifty
7 percent of the amount of the officer's annuity. At such time as any
8 dependent child of the officer attains nineteen years of age, the benefit
9 shall be divided equally among the remaining dependent children of the
10 officer who have not yet attained nineteen years of age. When there is no
11 remaining dependent child of the officer under nineteen years of age, the
12 benefit shall be:
13 (i) Prior to July 1, 2027, seventy-five percent of the amount of the
14 officer's annuity to the surviving spouse for the remainder of the

20 children of the officer under nineteen years of age, the benefit shall be
21 equal to:
22 (i) Prior to July 1, 2027, seventy-five percent of the officer's
23 annuity to the dependent children of the officer under nineteen years of
24 age to be divided equally among such dependent children. At such time as
25 any dependent child of the officer attains nineteen years of age, the
26 benefit shall be divided equally among the remaining dependent children
27 of the officer who have not yet attained nineteen years of age; and
28 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2027, one hundred percent of the officer's
29 annuity to the dependent children of the officer under nineteen years of

1 benefit shall be divided equally among the remaining dependent children
2 of the officer who have not yet attained nineteen years of age; and
3 (e) If there is no surviving spouse or no dependent child or
4 children of the officer under nineteen years of age, the amount of
5 benefit such officer has received under the Nebraska State Patrol
6 Retirement Act shall be computed. If such amount is less than the
7 contributions to the State Patrol Retirement Fund made by such officer,
8 plus regular interest, the difference shall be paid to the officer's
9 designated beneficiary or estate.
10 (4) Upon the death of an officer after retirement for reasons of
11 disability, benefits shall be provided as if the officer had retired for
12 reasons other than disability.

3 benefit shall be divided equally among the remaining dependent children
4 of the officer who have not yet attained nineteen years of age; and
5 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2027, one hundred percent of the officer's
6 annuity to the dependent children of the officer under nineteen years of
7 age to be divided equally among such dependent children. At such time as
8 any dependent child of the officer attains nineteen years of age, the
9 benefit shall be divided equally among the remaining dependent children
10 of the officer who have not yet attained nineteen years of age; and
11 (e) If no benefits are paid to a surviving spouse or dependent child
12 or children of the officer, benefits will be paid as described in
13 subsection (1) of section 81-2031.
14 (6) A lump-sum death benefit paid to the member's beneficiary, other
15 than the member's estate, that is an eligible distribution may be
16 distributed in the form of a direct transfer to a retirement plan
17 eligible to receive such transfer under the provisions of the Internal
18 Revenue Code.
19 (7) For any member whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2007,
20 while performing qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)
21 of the Internal Revenue Code, the member's beneficiary shall be entitled
22 to any additional death benefit that would have been provided, other than
23 the accrual of any benefit relating to the period of qualified military
24 service. The additional death benefit shall be determined as if the
25 member had returned to employment with the Nebraska State Patrol and such
26 employment had terminated on the date of the member's death.
27 (8) Any changes made to this section by Laws 2004, LB 1097, shall
28 apply only to retirements, disabilities, and deaths occurring on or after
29 July 16, 2004.
30 Sec. 5. Original sections 79-916, 79-958, 79-966, and 81-2026,

Introduced by Ballard, 21; at the request of the Governor.
Read first time January 22, 2025
Committee: Nebraska Retirement Systems
1 A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to retirement; to amend sections 79-916,
2 79-958, 79-966, and 81-2026, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska;
3 to change provisions and state legislative intent relating to

10 Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
-1-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 Section 1. Section 79-916, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 79-916 (1)(a) On July 1, 2004, the board shall transfer from the
4 School Retirement Fund to the Service Annuity Fund an amount equal to the
5 funded ratio of the retirement system which is equal to the market value
6 of the retirement system assets divided by the actuarial accrued
7 liability of the retirement system, times the actuarial accrued liability
8 of the service annuity, as determined pursuant to section 79-966.01, of
9 the employees who are members of the retirement system established
10 pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement Act. Beginning July
11 1, 2013, such actuarial accrued liability shall be determined for each
12 employee on a level percentage of salary basis. On or before July 1 of
13 each fiscal year, the state shall transfer into the Service Annuity Fund
14 such amounts as may be necessary to pay the normal cost and amortize the
15 unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the service annuity, as
16 determined pursuant to section 79-966.01, as of the end of the previous
17 fiscal year of the employees who are members of the retirement system
18 established pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement Act.
19 Based on the fiscal year of the retirement system established pursuant to
20 the Class V School Employees Retirement Act, the administrator of such
21 system shall provide all membership information needed for the actuary
22 engaged by the retirement board to determine the normal cost and the
23 amortization payment of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability, as
24 determined pursuant to section 79-966.01, to be paid by the state to the
25 Service Annuity Fund each fiscal year as required by this subdivision.
26 (b) At the time of retirement of any employee who is a member of the
27 retirement system established pursuant to the Class V School Employees
28 Retirement Act and who was hired prior to July 1, 2016, the retirement
29 board shall, upon receipt of a certification of the administrator of such
30 retirement system of the name, identification number, date of birth,
31 retirement date, last date of employment, type of retirement, and number
-2-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 of years of service credited to such eligible employee at the date of
2 retirement, transfer from the Service Annuity Fund to the Class V school
3 district for transfer to the retirement system the actuarial accrued
4 liability of the service annuity to be paid to the Class V school
5 district by the state for transfer to the eligible employee for the years
6 of service thus certified as provided for members of the School Employees
7 Retirement System of the State of Nebraska under sections 79-933 and
8 79-952. Such transfer of the actuarial accrued liability to the Class V
9 school district for transfer to the retirement system established
10 pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement Act shall be in lieu
11 of the payment of the service annuity to which the employee would be
12 entitled.
13 (c) The Service Annuity Fund is created. The fund shall consist of
14 the amounts paid by the state and transferred from the School Retirement
15 Fund to the Class V school district for transfer to the retirement system
16 pursuant to this section to pay the service annuity to the Class V school
17 district for transfer to employees who are members of the retirement
18 system established pursuant to the Class V School Employees Retirement
19 Act. Any money in the Service Annuity Fund available for investment shall
20 be invested by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska
21 Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
22 (2)(a) For each fiscal year prior to July 1, 2025, in (2) In
23 addition to the transfer of the actuarial accrued liability of the
24 service annuity pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the state
25 shall also transfer to the funds of the Class V school district for
26 transfer to the district's retirement system an amount determined by
27 multiplying the compensation of all members of such retirement system by
28 the percent specified in subsection (2) of section 79-966 for determining
29 the amount of the state's payment to the School Retirement Fund plus the
30 amount determined under subdivision (1)(b) of section 79-966. The
31 transfer shall be made annually on or before July 1 of each fiscal year.
-3-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 (b) For each fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, in addition to the
2 transfer pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the state shall also
3 transfer to the funds of the Class V school district for transfer to the
4 district's retirement system an amount equal to two percent of the
5 compensation of all members of such retirement system plus the amount
6 determined under subdivision (1)(b) of section 79-966. The transfer shall
7 be made annually on or before July 1 of each fiscal year.
8 (c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the state transfer of
9 two percent of the compensation of all members of the district's
10 retirement system does not mean that the state assumes any additional
11 financial responsibility or liability for funding obligations of the
12 retirement system that remain the responsibility of the district as
13 described in the Class V School Employees Retirement Act.
14 Sec. 2. Section 79-958, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 79-958 (1)(a) (1) Beginning on September 1, 2012, and prior to July
17 1, 2025, for the purpose of providing the funds to pay for formula
18 annuities, every employee shall be required to deposit in the School
19 Retirement Fund nine and seventy-eight hundredths of one percent of
20 compensation. Such deposits shall be transmitted at the same time and in
21 the same manner as required employer contributions.
22 (b) Beginning in 2025 and each year thereafter, the employee
23 contribution rate shall be calculated as of July 1 and based on the
24 funded ratio of the actuarial value of assets in the School Retirement
25 Fund in the most recent previous year as reported in the annual actuarial
26 valuation report for the retirement system prepared for the retirement
27 board pursuant to section 84-1503. Beginning on July 1, 2025, for the
28 purpose of providing the funds to pay for formula annuities, every
29 employee shall deposit the following amounts into the School Retirement
30 Fund:
31 (i) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
-4-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 School Retirement Fund is less than ninety-six percent, nine and three-
2 quarters of one percent of compensation;
3 (ii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
4 School Retirement Fund is ninety-six percent or greater and less than
5 ninety-eight percent, eight and three-quarters of one percent of
6 compensation;
7 (iii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
8 School Retirement Fund is ninety-eight percent or greater and less than
9 one hundred percent, eight percent of compensation; and
10 (iv) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
11 School Retirement Fund is one hundred percent or greater, seven and one-
12 quarter of one percent of compensation.
13 (c) Deposits under this subsection shall be transmitted at the same
14 time and in the same manner as required employer contributions.
15 (2) For the purpose of providing the funds to pay for formula
16 annuities, every employer shall be required to deposit in the School
17 Retirement Fund one hundred one percent of the required contributions of
18 the school employees of each employer. Such deposits shall be transmitted
19 to the retirement board at the same time and in the same manner as such
20 required employee contributions.
21 (3) The employer shall pick up the member contributions required by
22 this section for all compensation paid on or after January 1, 1986, and
23 the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions
24 pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code in determining
25 federal tax treatment under the code and shall not be included as gross
26 income of the member until such time as they are distributed or made
27 available. The contributions, although designated as member
28 contributions, shall be paid by the employer in lieu of member
29 contributions. The employer shall pay these member contributions from the
30 same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the member. The
31 employer shall pick up these contributions by a compensation deduction
-5-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 through a reduction in the cash compensation of the member. Member
2 contributions picked up shall be treated for all purposes of the School
3 Employees Retirement Act in the same manner and to the same extent as
4 member contributions made prior to the date picked up.
5 (4) The employer shall pick up the member contributions made through
6 irrevocable payroll deduction authorizations pursuant to sections 79-921
7 and 79-933.03 to 79-933.06, and the contributions so picked up shall be
8 treated as employer contributions in the same manner as contributions
9 picked up under subsection (3) of this section.
10 Sec. 3. Section 79-966, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 79-966 (1)(a) On the basis of all data in the possession of the
13 retirement board, including such mortality and other tables as are
14 recommended by the actuary engaged by the retirement board and adopted by
15 the retirement board, the retirement board shall annually, on or before
16 July 1, determine the state deposit to be made by the state in the School
17 Retirement Fund for that fiscal year. The amount of such state deposit
18 shall be determined pursuant to section 79-966.01. The retirement board
19 shall thereupon certify the amount of such state deposit, and on the
20 warrant of the Director of Administrative Services, the State Treasurer
21 shall, as of July 1 of such year, transfer from funds appropriated by the
22 state for that purpose to the School Retirement Fund the amount of such
23 state deposit.
24 (b) Beginning July 1, 2016, the contingent state transfer described
25 in this subsection shall be calculated as a percent of compensation of
26 all members of the retirement system. For any year in which a deposit is
27 made to the School Retirement Fund under this subsection, if the actuary
28 for a retirement system provided for under the Class V School Employees
29 Retirement Act determines that the actuarially required contribution
30 rate, for the fiscal year of the retirement system that begins before the
31 state deposit, exceeds the rate of all contributions required pursuant to
-6-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 the Class V School Employees Retirement Act, using the amortization
2 period specified in section 79-966.01, the Class V district school board
3 may request a public hearing of the Appropriations Committee of the
4 Legislature to ask the state to transfer to the Class V school district
5 for transfer to the funds of the retirement system provided for under the
6 Class V School Employees Retirement Act an amount determined by
7 multiplying the compensation of all members of such retirement system by
8 the lesser of the percent of compensation transferred into the School
9 Retirement Fund under this subsection or the percent of compensation of
10 the members of the retirement system provided for under the Class V
11 School Employees Retirement Act needed to meet the actuarially required
12 contribution rate for such system, using the amortization period
13 specified in section 79-966.01. Any additional amount of transfer so
14 calculated, recommended by the Appropriations Committee of the
15 Legislature, and approved by the Legislature, shall be added to the two
16 percent specified in subsection (2) of this section for the amount
17 required by subsection (2) of section 79-916 to be transferred to the
18 Class V school district, which shall transfer such amount to the funds of
19 the retirement system provided for under the Class V School Employees
20 Retirement Act.
21 (2)(a) (2) For each fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014, and prior to
22 July 1, 2025, in addition to the state transfers required by subsections
23 (1) and (3) of this section, the state shall transfer into the School
24 Retirement Fund an amount equal to two percent of the compensation of all
25 members of the retirement system.
26 (b) Beginning in 2025 and each year thereafter, the state
27 contribution rate under this subsection shall be calculated as of July 1
28 and based on the funded ratio of the actuarial value of assets in the
29 School Retirement Fund in the most recent previous year as reported in
30 the annual actuarial valuation report for the retirement system produced
31 for the retirement board pursuant to section 84-1503. In addition to the
-7-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 state transfers required by subsections (1) and (3) of this section, the
2 state shall deposit the following amounts into the School Retirement
3 Fund:
4 (i) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
5 School Retirement Fund is less than ninety-six percent, an amount equal
6 to two percent of the compensation of all members of the retirement
7 system;
8 (ii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
9 School Retirement Fund is ninety-six percent or greater and less than one
10 hundred percent, an amount equal to seven-tenths of one percent of the
11 compensation of all members of the retirement system; and
12 (iii) If the funded ratio on the actuarial value of assets in the
13 School Retirement Fund is one hundred percent or greater, no transfer
14 shall be made under this subsection.
15 (3) In addition to the state deposits and transfers required by
16 subsections (1) and (2) of this section, beginning on July 1, 2005, and
17 each fiscal year thereafter for employees who become members prior to
18 July 1, 2016, the state shall transfer into the Service Annuity Fund such
19 amounts as may be necessary to pay the normal cost and amortize the
20 unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the service annuity benefit
21 established pursuant to sections 79-933 and 79-952 as accrued through the
22 end of the previous fiscal year of the school employees who are members
23 of the retirement system established pursuant to the Class V School
24 Employees Retirement Act.
25 Sec. 4. Section 81-2026, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 81-2026 (1)(a) Any officer qualified for an annuity as provided in
28 section 81-2025 for reasons other than disability shall be entitled to
29 receive a monthly annuity for the remainder of the officer's life. The
30 annuity payments shall continue until the end of the calendar month in
31 which the officer dies. The amount of the annuity shall be a percentage
-8-

LB645 LB645
2025 2025
1 of the officer's final average monthly compensation. For retirement on or
2 after the fifty-fifth birthday of the member or on or after the fiftieth
3 birthday of a member who has been in the employ of the state for twenty-
4 five years, as calculated in section 81-2033, the percentage shall be
5 three percent multiplied by the number of years of creditable service, as
6 calculated in section 81-2033, except that the percentage shall never be
7 greater than seventy-five percent.
8 (b) For retirement pursuant to subsection (2) of section 81-2025 on
9 or after the fiftieth birthday of the member but prior to the fifty-fifth
10 birthday of the member who has been in the employ of the state for less
11 than twenty-five years, as calculated in section 81-2033, the annuity
12 which would apply if the member were age fifty-five at the date of
13 retirement shall be reduced by five-ninths of one percent for each month
14 by which the early retirement date precedes age fifty-five or for each
15 month by which the early retirement date precedes the date upon which the
16 member has served for twenty-five years, whichever is earlier. Any
17 officer who has completed thirty years of creditable service with the
18 Nebraska State Patrol shall have retirement benefits computed as if the
19 officer had reached age fifty-five.
20 (c) For purposes of this computation:
21 (i) For an officer who became a member prior to July 1, 2016, final
22 average monthly compensation means the sum of the officer's total
23 compensation during the three twelve-month periods of service as an
24 officer in which compensation was the greatest divided by thirty-six and:
25 (A) For any officer employed on or before January 4, 1979, the
26 officer's total compensation includes payments received for unused
27 vacation and sick leave accumulated during the final three years of
28 service; or
29 (B) For any officer employed after January 4, 1979, and prior to
30 July 1, 2016, the officer's total compensation includes payments received
31 for unused holiday compensatory time and unused compensatory time; and

1 (ii) For an officer who became a member on or after July 1, 2016,
2 final average monthly compensation means the sum of the officer's total
3 compensation during the five twelve-month periods of service as an
4 officer in which compensation was the greatest divided by sixty and does
5 not include payments received for unused sick leave, unused vacation
6 leave, unused holiday compensatory time, unused compensatory time, or any
7 other type of unused leave, compensatory time, or similar benefits,
8 converted to cash payments. The five twelve-month periods used for
9 calculating an officer's final average monthly compensation ends with the
10 month during which the officer's final compensation is paid. In the
11 determination of compensation, that part of an officer's compensation for
12 the plan year which exceeds the officer's compensation for the preceding
13 plan year by more than eight percent during the capping period shall be
14 excluded. Such officer's compensation for the first plan year of the
15 capping period shall be compared to the officer's compensation received
16 for the plan year immediately preceding the capping period. For purposes
17 of this subdivision, capping period means the five plan years preceding
18 the officer's retirement date. The board may adopt and promulgate rules
19 and regulations for the implementation of this section, including rules
20 and regulations related to prorating, annualizing, or recalculating an
21 officer's final average monthly compensation for each plan year in the
22 capping period.
23 (2) Any officer qualified for an annuity as provided in section
24 81-2025 for reasons of disability shall be entitled to receive a monthly
25 annuity for the remainder of the period of disablement as provided in
26 sections 81-2028 to 81-2030. The amount of the annuity shall be fifty
27 percent of the officer's monthly compensation at the date of disablement
28 if the officer has completed seventeen or fewer years of creditable
29 service. If the officer has completed more than seventeen years of
30 creditable service, the amount of the annuity shall be three percent of
31 the final monthly compensation at the date of disablement multiplied by
-10-

2025 2025
1 the total years of creditable service but not to exceed seventy-five
2 percent of the final average monthly compensation as defined in
3 subsection (1) of this section. The date of disablement shall be the date
4 on which the benefits as provided in section 81-2028 have been exhausted.
5 (3) Upon the death of an officer after retirement for reasons other
6 than disability, benefits shall be provided as a percentage of the amount
7 of the officer's annuity, calculated as follows:

9 children of the officer under nineteen years of age, the surviving spouse
10 shall receive a benefit equal to:

12 officer's annuity for the remainder of the surviving spouse's life; and
13 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2027, one hundred percent of the amount of
14 the officer's annuity for the remainder of the surviving spouse's life;
15 (b) If there is a surviving spouse and the surviving spouse has in
16 his or her care a dependent child or children of the officer under
17 nineteen years of age and there is no other dependent child or children
18 of the officer not in the care of the surviving spouse under nineteen
19 years of age, the benefit shall be equal to one hundred percent of the
20 officer's annuity. When there is no remaining dependent child of the
21 officer under nineteen years of age, the benefit shall be:
22 (i) Prior to July 1, 2027, seventy-five percent of the amount of the
23 officer's annuity to the surviving spouse for the remainder of the
24 surviving spouse's life; and
25 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2027, one hundred percent of the amount of
26 the officer's annuity to the surviving spouse for the remainder of the
27 surviving spouse's life;
28 (c) If there is a surviving spouse and the surviving spouse has in

4 under nineteen years of age to be divided equally among such dependent
5 children but in no case shall the benefit received by a surviving spouse
6 and dependent children residing with such spouse be less than fifty
7 percent of the amount of the officer's annuity. At such time as any
8 dependent child of the officer attains nineteen years of age, the benefit
9 shall be divided equally among the remaining dependent children of the
10 officer who have not yet attained nineteen years of age. When there is no
11 remaining dependent child of the officer under nineteen years of age, the
12 benefit shall be:

21 equal to:
22 (i) Prior to July 1, 2027, seventy-five percent of the officer's
23 annuity to the dependent children of the officer under nineteen years of
24 age to be divided equally among such dependent children. At such time as
25 any dependent child of the officer attains nineteen years of age, the
26 benefit shall be divided equally among the remaining dependent children
27 of the officer who have not yet attained nineteen years of age; and
28 (ii) Beginning July 1, 2027, one hundred percent of the officer's
29 annuity to the dependent children of the officer under nineteen years of
30 age to be divided equally among such dependent children. At such time as

7 contributions to the State Patrol Retirement Fund made by such officer,
8 plus regular interest, the difference shall be paid to the officer's
9 designated beneficiary or estate.
10 (4) Upon the death of an officer after retirement for reasons of
11 disability, benefits shall be provided as if the officer had retired for
12 reasons other than disability.
