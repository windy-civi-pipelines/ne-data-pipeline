respect to services performed in a pay period by an individual for the person
employing him or her when any of such service is excepted by subdivision (6)(h)
of this section; and
(8) Notwithstanding the foregoing exclusions from the definition of

of this section; and
(8) Notwithstanding the foregoing exclusions from the definition of
employment, services shall be deemed to be in employment if with respect to

state unemployment compensation fund or which as a condition for full tax
credit against the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, as amended,
