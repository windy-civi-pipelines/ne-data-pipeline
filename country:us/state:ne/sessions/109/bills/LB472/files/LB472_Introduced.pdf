6 authorized by law to make rules and regulations, except the Adjutant

8 Nebraska Workers' Compensation Court, the Commission of Industrial
9 Relations, the Legislature, and the Secretary of State with respect to
10 the duties imposed by the act;
11 (2) Anecdotal problem means an isolated incident or issue based on
12 individual cases or specific situations, not indicative of a broader
13 pattern or systemic deficiency, and typically resolvable through existing
14 procedures or case-by-case interventions without necessitating new
15 regulatory requirements;
16 (3) Cost of compliance means the total estimated financial burden
17 imposed on individuals or businesses to adhere to regulatory
18 requirements;
19 (4) Monetized cost or benefit means those costs or benefits that can
20 be expressed in monetary terms, such as health benefits leading to a
21 reduction in health care costs for employees, improvements to market
22 efficiency due to loss reduction or reduced transaction costs, consumer
23 savings, licensure and registration fees, legal costs, certification and
24 education costs, material costs, or opportunity costs related to property
25 value or usage;
26 (5) Nonmonetized cost or benefit means those costs or benefits that

28 associated with changes in privacy protections, indirect environmental
29 impacts, changes in how markets are regulated, or changes in security
30 protocols or requirements;
31 (6) Regulatory requirement means any action or step that must be

2025 2025
1 taken or piece of information that must be provided in accordance with
2 legislation, regulation, guidance, policy, or forms, but does not include
3 nonbinding statements such as statements concerning only the internal
4 management of any agency not affecting private rights or procedures,
5 declaratory rulings, intra-agency or interagency memoranda, or agency
6 guidance that is not enforceable under the rule of law; and
7 (7) Systemic failure or problem means a widespread market failure,
8 government failure, or other issue affecting the functionality or
9 efficiency of an industry, market, process, or system within the state
10 that (a) is identified using a coherent and testable theory explaining
11 why the failure or problem is systemic rather than anecdotal and (b) is
12 reasonably considered to be possible to resolve or mitigate through
13 regulatory intervention.
14 Sec. 3. (1)(a) The Office of Regulatory Management is established,
15 which shall be under the direct control and supervision of the Director
16 of Regulatory Management appointed by the Governor to serve at the
17 pleasure of the Governor.
18 (b) The Director of Regulatory Management shall exercise the powers
19 and perform the duties conferred or imposed by the Regulatory Management
20 Act and perform such other duties as may be required by the Governor. The
21 director shall be responsible for the overall supervision of the office's
22 programs and personnel. The office shall serve as an agency whose
23 services are primarily for the support and regulation of other state
24 agencies in carrying out their regulatory functions.
25 (c) The office shall include appropriate staff to carry out the
26 duties and programs assigned to the office.
27 (2) The office shall supervise the establishment of a baseline
28 catalog of regulatory requirements currently in effect and accurately
29 maintain and publish such catalog in a manner that is fully transparent.
30 In order to create this catalog:
31 (a) Each agency shall conduct and communicate to the office an
-3-

LB472 LB472
2025 2025
1 internal review of all regulatory requirements currently in effect and
2 update such review at the request of the office or every two years,
3 whichever is soonest;
4 (b) Each regulatory requirement shall be listed along with its
5 governing regulation, statutory authority or requirement, or other
6 relevant documentation. The catalog shall retain a consistent format to
7 ensure data efficacy over time;
8 (c) Agency reviews, pursuant to this subsection, shall be completed
9 and communicated to the office no later than six months after the
10 effective date of this act. Thereafter, updates to agency reviews shall
11 be completed and communicated to the office no later than sixty days
12 after an update request or at the end of the two-year period described in
13 this subsection if no update has been requested by the office; and
14 (d) The office shall publish, in a manner that is fully transparent,
15 a biennial report showing the change in the number and estimated impact
16 of regulatory requirements currently enacted by each agency. Such report
17 shall include an estimated change in cost of compliance for the median
18 citizen or business of the State of Nebraska.
19 (3) The office shall collect, analyze, assess, and publish agency
20 evaluations, reports, needs assessments, or other due diligence related
21 to new regulatory requirements to ensure best practices are being
22 utilized in the creation of new requirements. All departments, agencies,
23 offices, or divisions of the State of Nebraska shall provide the office
24 with such evaluations, reports, needs assessments, or other due diligence
25 upon request.
26 (4) The office shall endeavor to ensure that agencies are (a)
27 clearly identifying a systemic failure or problem that requires new
28 regulatory action to solve and not an anecdotal problem that could be
29 handled on a case-by-case basis, (b) analyzing credible and substantial
30 empirical evidence to support the agency's identification of a systemic
31 failure or problem, (c) establishing a clear analysis of the costs and
-4-

LB472 LB472
2025 2025
1 benefits of new regulatory requirements to be taken to solve a systemic
2 failure or problem identified by the agency, and (d) adequately
3 addressing uncertainty about the existence or impact of the systemic
4 failure or problem identified by the agency.
5 (5) When establishing an analysis of a regulatory requirement, an
6 agency shall provide monetized estimates of nonmonetized costs or
7 benefits when such an estimate is feasible, and quantitative estimates of
8 nonmonetized effects when such an estimate is not feasible. If neither a
9 monetized nor a quantitative estimate is feasible for a nonmonetized
10 cost, agencies shall provide a note within the analysis with qualitative
11 descriptions of such nonmonetized costs and benefits.
12 (6) If the office determines that best practices were not used in
13 identifying a systemic failure or problem and subsequent regulatory
14 action taken by an agency, the office shall communicate to the agency and
15 the Governor a request to reevaluate the decision to take regulatory
16 action based on the best practices established in the Regulatory
17 Management Act and those further established by the office. The office
18 shall not consider a statement of statutory authorization to be
19 sufficient due diligence in the identification of a systemic failure or
20 problem or as substantial evidence of the need for new regulatory action.
21 (7) The office shall publish agency evaluations, reports, needs
22 assessments, or other due diligence provided, as well as the office's
23 assessment thereof, in a manner that is fully transparent.
24 (8) If any new regulatory requirement is mandated by statute, such
25 information shall be included in the information provided to the office
26 and shall be published in the office's assessment thereof in accordance
27 with the act.
28 (9) The office shall not have the authority to authorize or reject
29 regulatory actions taken by any other agency.
