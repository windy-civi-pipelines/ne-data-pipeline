1 statement of any opinions the witness may offer, including the basis and
2 reasons for such opinions.
3 (2) The court may issue such an order pursuant to the provisions of
4 this section. In the exercise of its judicial discretion, the court shall
5 consider, among other things, whether:
6 (a) The request is material to the preparation of the defense;
7 (b) The request is not made primarily for the purpose of harassing
8 the prosecution or its witnesses;
9 (c) The request, if granted, would not unreasonably delay the trial
10 of the offense and an earlier request by the defendant could not have
11 reasonably been made;
12 (d) There is no substantial likelihood that the request, if granted,
13 would preclude a just determination of the issues at the trial of the
14 offense; or
15 (e) The request, if granted, would not result in the possibility of
16 bodily harm to, or coercion of, witnesses.
17 (3) Whenever the court refuses to grant an order pursuant to the
18 provisions of this section, it shall render its findings in writing
19 together with the facts upon which the findings are based.
20 (4) Whenever the prosecuting attorney believes that the granting of
21 an order under the provisions of this section will result in the
22 possibility of bodily harm to witnesses or that witnesses will be
23 coerced, the court may permit him or her to make such a showing in the
24 form of a written statement to be inspected by the court alone. The
25 statement shall be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be
26 made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal by the
27 defendant.
28 (5) This section is subject to the continuing duty of disclosure
29 under section 29-1918.
