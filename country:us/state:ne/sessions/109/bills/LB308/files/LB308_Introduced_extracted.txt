21 (a) proof of a certificate or policy of insurance written by an insurance
22 carrier duly authorized to do business in this state which gives the

2025 2025
1 department of such fact and maintain all files and other records relating
2 to its business as a health care staffing agency in Nebraska for a period
3 of two years. Such files and records shall be made available to the
4 department within seven calendar days after such files and records are
5 requested by the department.
6 Sec. 5. (1) A health care staffing agency shall not:
7 (a) Include in any contract with a staff worker or a health care

9 opportunities of a staff worker; or

11 require payment of liquidated damages, employment fees, or other
12 compensation if the staff worker is subsequently hired as a permanent
13 employee of the health care entity.
14 (2) Any clause of a contract that violates this section is void.
15 Sec. 6. (1) If the commissioner determines that a health care
16 staffing agency (a) failed to register as required by the Health Care
17 Staffing Agency Registration Act, (b) violated section 4 or 5 of this
18 act, (c) failed to provide documentation pursuant to section 7 of this
19 act, or (d) knowingly provided to a health care entity a staff worker who

21 registration, license, certification, or background check, the
22 commissioner may take one or more of the following actions:
23 (i) Assess a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars for
24 a first offense and five thousand dollars for each offense thereafter; or
25 (ii) Revoke the registration for a period of one calendar year. This
26 revocation shall apply to all locations of the health care staffing
27 agency.
28 (2) If the commissioner determines that a civil penalty or

23 request, by the Attorney General.

28 received.
29 (2) The commissioner may investigate to determine if a health care
30 staffing agency is in compliance with the Health Care Staffing Agency
31 Registration Act and shall conduct random audits of health care staffing

1 agencies with staff workers in Nebraska. Any investigation or audit shall
2 take place at such times and places as the commissioner directs, with no
3 fewer than three business days' prior notice.
4 (3) For purposes of any investigation or audit under this section,
5 the commissioner or any officer designated by the commissioner may
6 administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their
7 attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books,
8 papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or
9 records that the commissioner deems relevant or material to the
10 investigation.
11 (4) In case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to
12 any person, any court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by the
13 commissioner and determination that such refusal was not based on a
14 reasonable interpretation of applicable law, may issue to such person an
15 order requiring such person to appear before the commissioner or the
16 officer designated by the commissioner and produce documentary evidence,
17 if so ordered, or give evidence affecting the matter under investigation
18 or in question. Such person shall be afforded an opportunity to provide
19 the commissioner and, if an application is made to a court of competent
20 jurisdiction by the commissioner to enforce the subpoena, the court with
21 an analysis or argument as to why such contumacy or refusal is based on a
22 reasonable interpretation of applicable law. Any failure to obey the
23 order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.
24 Sec. 8. (1) The department shall create a database of health care
25 staffing agencies registered under the Health Care Staffing Agency
26 Registration Act. The department shall make the database accessible to
27 the public on its website.
