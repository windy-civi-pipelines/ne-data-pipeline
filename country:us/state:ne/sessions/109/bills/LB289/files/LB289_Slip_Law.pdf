amended to read:
17-201 (1) Any municipality containing not less than one hundred nor more
than eight hundred inhabitants as determined by the most recent federal
decennial census or the most recent revised certified count by the United
States Bureau of the Census incorporated as a village under the laws of this
state, any village that votes to retain village government as provided in
section 17-312, and any city of the second class that has adopted village
government as provided by sections 17-306 to 17-309 shall be a village and
shall have the rights, powers, and immunities granted by law to villages. The
population of a village shall consist of the people residing within the
territorial boundaries of such village and the residents of any territory duly
and properly annexed to such village.
(2) Whenever a majority of the inhabitants of any village, not
incorporated under any laws of this state, present a petition to the county
board of the county in which the petitioners reside, requesting that they may
be incorporated as a village and designating the name they wish to assume,
whether the village board of trustees will have three or five members, and the
metes and bounds of the proposed village, and a majority of the members of such
county board are satisfied that a majority of the inhabitants of the proposed
village have signed such petition and that inhabitants to the number of one
hundred or more are actual residents of the territory described in the
petition, the county board shall declare the proposed village incorporated,
enter the order of incorporation upon its records, and designate the metes and
bounds of such village. Thereafter the village shall be governed by the
provisions of law applicable to the government of villages. The county board
shall, at the time of the incorporation of the village, appoint three or five
persons pursuant to the number of members of the village board designated in
the petition, having the qualifications provided in section 17-203, as the
village board of trustees, who shall hold their offices and perform all the
duties required of them by law until the election and qualification of their
successors at the time and in the manner provided in section 17-202, except
that the county board shall not declare a proposed village incorporated or
enter an order of incorporation if any portion of the territory of such
proposed village is within five miles of another incorporated municipality.
Sec. 2. Section 17-202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:

a board of trustees which shall consist of three or five members. At the first
statewide general election held after the incorporation of a village with five
members, two trustees shall be elected to serve two years and three trustees
shall be elected to serve four years. At the first statewide general election
held after the incorporation of a village with three members, two trustees
shall be elected to serve four years and one trustee shall be elected to serve
two years. At the first statewide general election held after changing the
number of trustees from five to three, one trustee shall be elected to serve
two years and two trustees shall be elected to serve four years. The two
trustees receiving the highest and second highest number of votes or tied for
the highest number of votes shall serve the four-year terms, and the trustee
receiving the next highest number of votes shall serve the two-year term.
Thereafter the board members shall be elected as provided in the Election Act.
The terms shall begin on the first regular meeting of the board in December
following the statewide general election. The changes made to this section by
Laws 1994, LB 76, and Laws 1995, LB 194, shall not change the staggering of the
terms of the board members in villages established prior to January 1, 1995.

trustees under subsection (2) of this section, the registered voters in any
village may vote at any statewide general election as to whether the village
board of trustees shall consist of three or five members. Upon the completion
