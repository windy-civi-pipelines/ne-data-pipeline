ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 33
Introduced by Conrad, 46.
WHEREAS, the Legislature recognizes that its approach to biannual time
changes is antiquated, and causes disruptions and negative impacts to
individual health and business productivity; and
WHEREAS, common-sense reforms to modernize the approach that are sensible,
fair, and practical are necessary and desired by a wide majority of Nebraskans
and Americans; and
WHEREAS, the present options available to the states under the federal
Uniform Time Act of 1966 can create uncertainty and result in a patchwork
approach that is confusing and unworkable; and
WHEREAS, in 2022 the United States Senate voted unanimously in support of
the Sunshine Protection Act, which would have made daylight saving time the
permanent standard time; and
WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump has publicly called for an end to
daylight saving time; and
WHEREAS, pending legislation on this topic will be before the United
States Congress which would accomplish comprehensive reform.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Legislature recommends that the Nebraska Congressional
delegation take affirmative action to reform the present approach to daylight
saving time.
2. That such reform should advance Nebraska's commitment to enhancing
individual and family health, growing economic productivity, protecting
agriculture, advancing Nebraska's public safety goals, and ensuring national
uniformity.
