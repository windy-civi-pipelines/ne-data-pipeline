months; or

change in employment, earning capacity, or income or receipt of an ongoing
source of income from a pension, gift, lottery winnings, casino winnings,

order may be reviewed after one year if the department's determination after
the previous review was not to refer to the county attorney or authorized
attorney for filing of an application for modification because financial
circumstances had not lasted or were not expected to last for the time periods
established by subdivision (1)(a) of this section.
(3)(a) (3) Notwithstanding the time periods set forth in subdivision (1)
