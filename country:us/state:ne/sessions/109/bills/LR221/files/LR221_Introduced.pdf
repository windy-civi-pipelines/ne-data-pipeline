ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 221
Introduced by Fredrickson, 20.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the barriers to access to dental services for Nebraskans. The study
shall include, but need not be limited to, an examination of the following:
(1) How to assure all Nebraska residents have affordable access to dental
care with a dental home, particularly those that qualify for medicaid;
(2) How to address the lack of dentists and dental hygienists in dental
shortage areas;
(3) How to create a dental medicaid program that is sustainable;
(4) How to reduce the number of people seeking relief from dental pain in
the emergency room of a hospital;
(5) How to invest in public health dental infrastructure, including, but
not limited to, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Nebraska
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Oral Health and Dentistry,
federally qualified health centers, and local public health departments, to
help prevent dental problems and disease; and
(6) How the state might invest in urgent care dental clinics within
Nebraska's dental schools to provide acute care and deter people from using
emergency rooms for dental issues.
In conducting this interim study, the Health and Human Services Committee
of the Legislature may confer with other standing committees, state agencies,
the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry, the Creighton
University School of Dentistry, the Nebraska Dental Association, and other
appropriate stakeholders, as well as create a work group, conduct meetings, and
make site visits.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
