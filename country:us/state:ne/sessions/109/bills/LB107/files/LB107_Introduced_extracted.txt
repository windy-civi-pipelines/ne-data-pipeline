6 percentage increase equal to the percentage increase, if any, in the

16 valuation in the state. By September 15, the Property Tax Administrator
17 shall determine the amount to be disbursed under this subdivision to each
18 county and certify such amounts to the State Treasurer and to each
19 county. The disbursements to the counties shall occur in two equal
20 payments, the first on or before January 31 and the second on or before
21 April 1. After retaining one percent of the receipts for costs, the
22 county treasurer shall allocate the remaining receipts to each taxing
23 unit levying taxes on taxable property in the tax district in which the
24 real property is located in the same proportion that the levy of such
25 taxing unit bears to the total levy on taxable property of all the taxing
26 units in the tax district in which the real property is located.
27 (b) Beginning with tax year 2017, the amount disbursed to each
28 county shall be equal to the amount available for disbursement determined
29 under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by the ratio of the
30 credit allocation valuation in the county to the credit allocation
31 valuation in the state. By September 15, the Property Tax Administrator

6 county treasurer shall allocate the remaining receipts to each taxing
7 unit based on its share of the credits granted to all taxpayers in the
8 taxing unit.
9 (5) For purposes of this section, credit allocation valuation means
10 the taxable value for all real property except agricultural land and
11 horticultural land, one hundred twenty percent of taxable value for
12 agricultural land and horticultural land that is not subject to special
13 valuation, and one hundred twenty percent of taxable value for
14 agricultural land and horticultural land that is subject to special
15 valuation.
16 (6) The State Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund to the
17 Property Tax Credit Cash Fund one hundred five million dollars by August
18 1, 2007, and one hundred fifteen million dollars by August 1, 2008.

26 units in the tax district in which the real property is located.
