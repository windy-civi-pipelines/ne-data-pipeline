1 (8) After establishment of a good life district pursuant to this
2 section, but within twelve months after the approval of the original
3 application or after any modification is made to the boundaries of a good
4 life district pursuant to this section, a city or village in which any
5 part of the applicable good life district is located may file a
6 supplemental request to the department to increase the size of the good
7 life district by up to one thousand acres. Such supplemental request
8 shall be accompanied by such materials and certifications necessary to
9 demonstrate that such increase would not negatively impact the criteria
10 that were necessary for the original establishment of such good life
11 district.
12 (9) After establishment of a good life district pursuant to this
13 section and after any modification is made to the boundaries of a good
14 life district pursuant to this section, the department shall transmit to
15 any city or village which includes such good life district within its
16 boundaries or within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction (a) all
17 information held by the department related to the application and
18 approval of the application, (b) all documentation which describes the
19 property included within the good life district, and (c) all
20 documentation transmitted to the applicant for such good life district
21 with approval of the application and establishment of the good life
22 district. Such city or village shall be subject to the same
23 confidentiality restrictions as provided in subsection (3) of section
24 77-4404, except that all such documents, plans, and specifications
25 included in the application which the city or village determine define or
26 describe the project may be provided upon written request of any person
27 who owns property in the applicable good life district.
28 (10) After establishment of a good life district that exceeds one
29 thousand acres in size, the good life district applicant may apply to the
30 department to establish development and design standards for the good
31 life district. Such standards may include, but are not limited to,
-6-

LB707 LB707
2025 2025
1 standards for architectural design, landscape design, construction
2 materials, and sustainability, but may not require property owners to
3 utilize specific contractors, professionals, suppliers, or service
4 providers. The department may approve the standards after holding a
5 hearing after one hundred eighty days' notice to all property owners in
6 the district if the department finds that the standards will ensure a
7 comprehensive and cohesive character and aesthetic for development in the
8 good life district, and that the standards will further the purposes of
9 the Good Life Transformational Projects Act. The development and design
10 standards must be commercially reasonable and consistent with terminology
11 and accepted practices in the architecture industry, must not conflict
12 with any building code or other similar law or regulation, and must not
13 impose an undue burden on property owners in the district. If approved,
14 the standards shall apply to all new construction inside of the good life
15 district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such standards established
16 by the department shall be in addition and supplemental to any local
17 zoning, building code, comprehensive plan, or similar requirements of the
18 city or village, which requirements of the city or village shall control
19 to the extent of any conflict with any design standards established by
20 the department.
21 (11) Demonstration of meeting the required new development costs for
22 purposes of subdivision (2)(a) of this section may be established by
23 evidence submitted by the good life district applicant, the city or
24 village where the good life district is located, or any other person
25 which submits satisfactory evidence to the department.
26 Sec. 2. Original section 77-4405, Revised Statutes Cumulative
27 Supplement, 2024, is repealed.
