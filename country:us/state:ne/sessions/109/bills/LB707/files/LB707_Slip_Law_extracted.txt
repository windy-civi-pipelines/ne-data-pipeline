(ii) two and three-quarters percent upon the same transactions that are sourced
under the provisions of sections 77-2703.01 to 77-2703.04 within the good life
district program area on which the State of Nebraska is authorized to impose a
tax pursuant to the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967, as amended from time to time.

aircraft, all-terrain vehicles, barges, motor vehicles, motorboats, railroad
rolling stock, semitrailers, and trailers, to the city in which all or a
portion of the good life district is located. Such state sales taxes shall be

district retailer that was operating in the good life district when the good
life district was established, not to exceed an aggregate total of five million
dollars per year, except that relocated good life district retailers as defined
in section 77-4403 shall exceed the five-million-dollar cap to the extent there

-11-

LB707 LB707
2025 2025
allocation or refund reduction from allocated amounts within the good life
district in the amount of five million dollars plus the excess allocation or
reduction over five million dollars; and
(iii) Fifty percent of the state sales taxes that were not subject to
allocation under subdivision (b)(i) or (ii) of this subsection or a reduced
rate under subsection (7) of section 77-4405 and that were paid by a good life
district applicant, project area applicant, or good life district retailer on
new development costs for a new business, additional good life district
retailer, or relocated good life district retailer, as such terms are defined
in section 77-4403.
(c) Allocated sales taxes shall not include any state sales taxes
collected pursuant to subdivision (7)(c) of section 77-4405.
(d) The Tax Commissioner shall remit the allocated sales taxes, after
deducting the amount of refunds from allocated amounts, to the appropriate city
on a monthly basis in the manner prescribed in the Local Option Revenue Act.

city with each such monthly remittance which includes the real estate parcel,
the good life district applicant, the good life district retailer, the
aggregate amount of taxable sales, and the amount of remittance attributable to
the good life district applicant and each good life district retailer for such
remittance period. The Tax Commissioner shall also provide each such report to
the department. The details of each such report shall be kept confidential by

of revenue. The designated portion shall only include amounts collected on
transactions occurring within the good life district program area and may be
further restricted by the city in such ordinance or dedicated to pay such
expenses as agreed to by the city and the good life district applicant.

pursuant to section 77-27,142 which has been designated by the city for such
purpose pursuant to an ordinance, which may only include amounts collected on
transactions occurring within the good life district program area, and which
may be further restricted by the city in such ordinance, or dedicated to pay
such expenses as agreed to between the city and the good life district
applicant.
(2) The local option sales and use tax imposed pursuant to subdivision (1)
(a) of this section shall be separate and apart from any sales and use tax
imposed by the city pursuant to the Local Option Revenue Act and shall not be
considered imposed by or pursuant to the Local Option Revenue Act for any
purpose under Nebraska law. The local option sales and use tax imposed pursuant
to subdivision (1)(a) of this section shall not be subject to deduction for any
refunds made pursuant to section 77-4105, 77-4106, 77-5725, or 77-5726, and
shall not be affected by or included in the tax incentives available under the
Employment and Investment Growth Act, the Nebraska Advantage Act, the ImagiNE
Nebraska Act, the Nebraska Advantage Transformational Tourism and Redevelopment
Act, the Urban Redevelopment Act, or any other tax incentive act which affects
the local option sales tax imposed by a city pursuant to the Local Option

the investment of such funds, shall be deposited into such fund. Any proceeds
from the issuance and sale of bonds pursuant to the Good Life District Economic
Development Act to provide funds to carry out the good life district economic
development program, shall be deposited into the good life district economic
development fund, or with a bond trustee pursuant to any resolution, trust
indenture, or other security instrument entered into in connection with the
issuance of such bonds, or as otherwise provided in section 77-4423. The city
shall not transfer or remove funds from a good life district economic
development fund other than for the purposes prescribed in the act, and the
money in a good life district economic development fund shall not be commingled
with any other city funds.

development fund, including from proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to the Good
Life District Economic Development Act, to a qualifying business shall be made
only upon receipt of evidence that such distribution is for the payment or
-12-

LB707 LB707
2025 2025

approval in the ordinance establishing the applicable program, with a bond
trustee under a bond resolution or trust indenture, or as may otherwise be
determined appropriate by the city.

currently required or committed for purposes of such good life district
economic development program shall be invested as provided for in section
77-2341.

be deposited in the general fund of the city. Any funds received by the city by
reason of a good life district economic development program after the
termination of such program shall be transferred from such good life district
economic development fund to the general fund of the city as such funds are
received.
(5) A good life district economic development fund shall not be terminated
until such time as all bonds, contracts, and other obligations payable from
such fund are no longer outstanding or are extinguished as provided in section
77-4418, and all funds related to them fully accounted for, with no further
city action required, and after the completion of a final audit pursuant to
