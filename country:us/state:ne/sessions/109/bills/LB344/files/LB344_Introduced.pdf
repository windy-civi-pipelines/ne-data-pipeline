1 Section 1. Section 46-740, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 46-740 (1) If allocation is adopted for use of ground water for
4 irrigation purposes in a management area, the permissible withdrawal of
5 ground water shall be allocated equally per irrigated acre except as
6 permitted by subsections (4) through (6) of section 46-739. Such
7 allocation shall specify the total number of acre-inches that are
8 allocated per irrigated acre per year, except that the district may allow
9 a ground water user to average his or her allocation over any reasonable
10 period of time. A ground water user may use his or her allocation on all
11 or any part of the irrigated acres to which the allocation applies or in
12 any other manner approved by the district.
13 (2) Except as permitted pursuant to subsections (4) through (6) of
14 section 46-739, if annual rotation or reduction of irrigated acres is
15 adopted for use of ground water for irrigation purposes in a management
16 area, the nonuse of irrigated acres shall be a uniform percentage
17 reduction of each landowner's irrigated acres within the management area
18 or a subarea of the management area. Such uniform reduction may be
19 adjusted for each landowner based upon crops grown on his or her land to
20 reflect the varying consumptive requirements between crops.
21 (3)(a) If allocations to any municipality have been made prior to
22 November 1, 2005, such allocations shall remain in full force and effect,
23 but may be amended by the appropriate natural resources district. (3)
24 Unless allocations have been made an integrated management plan, a rule,
25 or an order is established, adopted, or issued prior to November 1, 2005,
26 no integrated management plan, rule, or order shall limit the use of
27 ground water by a municipality, within an area determined by the
28 Department of Natural Resources to be fully appropriated pursuant to
29 section 46-714 or designated as overappropriated pursuant to section
30 46-713, until January 1, 2026, except that on and after January 1, 2026,
31 any new or expanded commercial or industrial user served by a municipal

1 water source that commences water use at a rate in excess of twenty-five
2 million gallons annually, expands water use to a rate in excess of
3 twenty-five million gallons annually, or at any time exceeds water use of
4 twenty-five million gallons annually shall be subject to the controls of
5 an integrated management plan, rule, or order and provide a mitigation
6 report to the natural resources district within which such user is
7 located. The mitigation report shall include (i) annual water use, (ii)
8 annual volume of water returned to the municipal system or discharged to
9 another location, (iii) source of water used to mitigate the new or
10 expanded consumptive use, and (iv) any other information deemed necessary
11 by the applicable natural resources district or the Department of Natural
12 Resources. The mitigation report shall be approved by the applicable
13 natural resources district and the Department of Natural Resources prior
14 to January 1, 2026, or prior to commencement of the new or expanded
15 use. :
16 (b) Each integrated management plan, rule, or order within an area
17 determined by the Department of Natural Resources to be fully
18 appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 or designated as overappropriated
19 pursuant to section 46-713 may require annual water use and water
20 consumption reporting from municipalities.
21 (a) Any allocations to a municipality that have been made as of
22 November 1, 2005, shall remain in full force and effect unless changed by
23 the appropriate natural resources district;
24 (b)(i) For any municipality that has not received an allocation as
25 of November 1, 2005, the minimum annual allocation may be the greater of
26 either the amount of ground water authorized by a permit issued pursuant
27 to the Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act or
28 the governmental, commercial, and industrial uses of the municipality
29 plus a per capita allowance. Water for commercial and industrial uses may
30 be limited as specified in subdivision (b)(iii) of this subsection.
31 (ii) The per capita allowance shall be based on the location of the

1 municipality, increasing in equal increments from east to west, and shall
2 not be less than two hundred gallons per person per day at 95 degrees, 19
3 minutes, 00 seconds longitude and not less than two hundred fifty gallons
4 per person per day at 104 degrees, 04 minutes, 00 seconds longitude.

6 considered part of the municipality's population if such service begins
7 prior to January 1, 2026.
8 (iii) Prior to January 1, 2026, any new or expanded single
9 commercial or single industrial development served by any municipality
10 within the fully appropriated or overappropriated area which, after July
11 14, 2006, commences water use resulting in the consumptive use of water
12 in amounts greater than twenty-five million gallons annually may be
13 subject to controls adopted pursuant to section 46-715;
14 (c) Prior to January 1, 2026, increases in the consumptive use of
15 water by a municipality that result in a decrease in streamflow shall be
16 addressed by the integrated management plan pursuant to controls or
17 incentive programs adopted pursuant to section 46-715 and shall not
18 affect the municipal allocations outlined in subdivisions (3)(a) and (b)
19 of this section. Any permanent reduction in consumptive use of water
20 associated with municipal growth, including governmental, industrial, and
21 commercial growth, during the period between July 14, 2006, and January
22 1, 2026, shall accrue to the benefit of the natural resources district
23 within which such municipality is located; and
24 (d) To qualify for the exemption specified in subsection (3) of this
25 section, any city of the metropolitan class, city of the primary class,
26 city of the first class, or city of the second class shall file a
27 conservation plan with the natural resources district, if required by the
28 integrated management plan. Villages and other municipalities smaller
29 than a city of the second class shall not be required to submit a
30 conservation plan to qualify for such exemption.

13 (4) (5) Unless an integrated management plan, rule, or order is
14 established, adopted, or issued prior to November 1, 2005, no integrated
15 management plan, rule, or order shall limit the use of ground water by a
16 nonmunicipal commercial or industrial water user within an area
17 determined by the department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section
18 46-714 or designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713,
