1 Section 1. Section 44-3,158, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
2 is amended to read:
3 44-3,158 (1) For purposes of this section:
4 (a) Assigned risk employer means a Nebraska employer that is in good
5 faith entitled to, but is unable to obtain, workers' compensation
6 insurance through ordinary methods; and
7 (b) Director means the Director of Insurance.
8 (2)(a) The director shall enter into an agreement with one or more
9 workers' compensation insurers to provide workers' compensation insurance
10 to assigned risk employers. In selecting an insurer to become an assigned
11 risk insurer, the director shall consider the cost of coverage to
12 assigned risk employers, the loss control and claims handling services
13 available from the workers' compensation insurer, the financial condition
14 of the workers' compensation insurer, and any other relevant factors. An
15 agreement entered into under this subsection may not exceed five years.
16 (b) If the director determines that the cost of workers'
17 compensation insurance premiums for an insurer to provide assigned risk
18 coverage pursuant to such an agreement would be unreasonably high, the
19 director may enter into an agreement in which the assigned risk insurer
20 covers a portion of the losses incurred by the assigned risk employer.
21 Any agreement that involves an average rate level of less than two and
22 one-half times the prospective loss costs approved for an advisory
23 organization pursuant to section 44-7511 shall not be considered
24 unreasonably high for the purposes of this section. Pursuant to any such
25 agreement, remaining losses shall be assessed against all workers'
26 compensation insurers writing workers' compensation insurance in this
27 state and risk management pools created under the Intergovernmental Risk
28 Management Act based on their workers' compensation premiums written in
29 this state or contributions made to risk management pools. Assigned risk
30 premiums shall be excluded from the basis for such assessments.
31 (c) If the assigned risk system described in subdivisions (2)(a) and
-2-

LB397 LB397
2025 2025
1 (b) of this section ceases to be viable because no qualified insurer is
2 willing to provide workers' compensation coverage at an average rate
3 level of two and one-half times the prospective loss costs approved for
4 an advisory organization pursuant to section 44-7511 without also
5 requiring substantial sharing of losses with all other workers'
6 compensation insurers writing workers' compensation insurance in this
7 state and risk management pools created under the Intergovernmental Risk
8 Management Act, then the director may, after consultation with insurers
9 authorized to issue workers' compensation insurance policies in this
10 state, create a reasonable alternative assigned risk system involving the
11 sharing of premiums and losses for assigned risk employers among all such
12 workers' compensation insurers writing workers' compensation insurance in
13 this state and such risk management pools. If established, such
14 alternative assigned risk system shall not utilize an average rate level
15 of less than two and one-half times the prospective loss costs approved
16 for an advisory organization pursuant to section 44-7511.
17 (3) The director may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to
18 carry out this section.
19 (4) An employer shall not be considered to be in good faith entitled
20 to be covered by workers' compensation insurance under this section if:
21 (a) The employer is required to establish a safety committee
22 pursuant to sections 48-443 to 48-445 and is not in compliance with such
23 sections;
24 (a) (b) The employer is in default on workers' compensation
25 premiums;
26 (b) (c) The employer has failed to reimburse an insurer for amounts
27 to be repaid pursuant to workers' compensation insurance written on a
28 policy with a deductible;
29 (c) (d) The employer has failed to provide an insurer reasonable
30 access to books and records necessary for a premium audit;
31 (d) (e) The employer has defrauded or attempted to defraud an
-3-

LB397 LB397
2025 2025
1 insurer; or
2 (e) (f) The employer is found to have been owned or controlled by
3 persons who owned or controlled a prior employer that is or would be
4 ineligible for coverage pursuant to subdivisions (4)(a) (4)(b) through
5 (d) (e) of this section.
6 Sec. 2. Section 48-144.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 48-144.03 (1) Notwithstanding policy provisions that stipulate a
9 workers' compensation insurance policy to be a contract with a fixed term
10 of coverage that expires at the end of the term, coverage under a
11 workers' compensation insurance policy shall continue in full force and
12 effect until notice is given in accordance with this section.
13 (2) No cancellation of a workers' compensation insurance policy
14 within the policy period shall be effective unless notice of the
15 cancellation is given by the workers' compensation insurer to the
16 Nebraska Workers' Compensation Court and to the employer. No such
17 cancellation shall be effective until thirty days after the giving of

22 insurer for the employer, (c) failure of the employer to reimburse

26 (3) No workers' compensation insurance policy shall expire or lapse
27 at the end of the policy period unless notice of nonrenewal is given by
28 the workers' compensation insurer to the compensation court and to the
29 employer. No workers' compensation insurance policy shall expire or lapse
30 until thirty days after the giving of such notices, except that a policy

2025 2025
1 section 48-146.03.

6 deemed given upon receipt and acceptance by the compensation court.

19 federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the federal Mine
20 Safety and Health Administration standards.
21 (10) Any person who knowingly operates or causes to be operated a
22 business in violation of recommendations to correct serious or imminent

2 The state and its officers and employees shall not be construed to assume

10 corrected to the satisfaction of the inspector.
11 (14) No person with a reasonable cause to believe the truth of the
12 information shall be subject to civil liability for libel, slander, or
13 any other relevant tort cause of action by virtue of providing

17 (15) Safety and health inspectors employed by the Department of
18 Labor shall have the right and power to enter any premise, building, or
19 structure, public or private, for the purpose of inspecting any work area
20 or equipment. A refusal by the employer of entry by a safety and health
21 inspector employed by the Department of Labor shall be a violation of
22 this subsection. If the Commissioner of Labor finds, after notice and
23 hearing, that an employer has violated this subsection, he or she may
24 order payment of a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars
25 for each violation. Each day of continued violation shall constitute a
26 separate violation.
