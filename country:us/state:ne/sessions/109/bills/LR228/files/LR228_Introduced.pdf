FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 228
Introduced by Cavanaugh, J., 9; Dungan, 26.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine and assess the adequacy of compensation for higher education faculty
who primarily engage in classroom instruction within Nebraska's public
institutions. This study will identify disparities, analyze competitive salary
structures, and explore potential policy solutions to ensure faculty members
receive fair and competitive compensation. The study shall include, but need
not be limited to, an examination of the following:
(1) A review of current salary levels and compensation structures for
faculty in Nebraska's public higher education institutions;
(2) A comparison of Nebraska's public higher education faculty salaries
with those at peer institutions in surrounding states;
(3) An examination of salary disparities across disciplines and the impact
of those disparities on recruitment and retention;
(4) An analysis of the impact of faculty compensation on student outcomes,
including retention and graduation rates;
(5) A review of potential funding mechanisms or policy changes to enhance
faculty compensation in a sustainable manner; and
(6) Consideration of alternative compensation models, including cost-of-
living increases, performance-based pay, benefits enhancements, and other
incentives.
In conducting this interim study, the Education Committee of the
Legislature may confer with the Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary
Education, the University of Nebraska, state colleges, community colleges,
faculty organizations, faculty members, administrators, students, policy
experts, other relevant entities, and stakeholders.
