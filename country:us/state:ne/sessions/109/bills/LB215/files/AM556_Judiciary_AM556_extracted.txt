AMENDMENTS TO LB215
Introduced by Judiciary.
2 sections:
3 Section 1. (1) The Legislature finds that individuals serving long-
4 term or life sentences who are rehabilitated and ready to be safely
5 released from incarceration should be able to earn a second chance by
6 receiving a commutation of their sentences from the Board of Pardons.
7 Such commutation is intended to allow such rehabilitated individuals to
8 be responsibly reintegrated into their communities while on parole and,
9 if successful on parole, as fully free individuals.
10 (2) For purposes of this section, second chance relief means a
11 program through which the department, the Division of Parole Supervision,
12 and the Board of Parole identify eligible committed offenders and work
13 with them to apply for a commutation from the Board of Pardons.
14 (3) The department, the Division of Parole Supervision, and the
15 Board of Parole shall establish a program to provide second chance relief
16 as provided in this section.
17 (4) A committed offender serving a sentence of imprisonment,
18 including life imprisonment, is eligible for second chance relief under
19 this section as follows:
20 (a) For an offense committed when the offender was younger than
21 twenty-six years of age, after serving at least twenty-five years of a
22 sentence of imprisonment; or
23 (b) For an offense committed when the offender was twenty-six years
24 of age or older, after serving at least thirty years of a sentence of
25 imprisonment.
26 (5) The department shall regularly identify committed offenders who
27 are eligible for second chance relief under this section or who will

1 become eligible within five years. The department shall regularly provide
2 lists of such offenders to the Board of Parole. The board shall advise
3 such offenders regarding the second chance relief program and work with
4 interested offenders to improve their chances of obtaining second chance
5 relief through rehabilitation and good behavior.
6 (6) In determining whether an eligible committed offender is
7 rehabilitated and a good candidate for second chance relief, the Board of
8 Parole shall:
9 (a) Complete a risk assessment for the committed offender; and
10 (b) Involve community leaders and stakeholders in the review process
11 to ensure that public safety and community concerns are addressed.
12 (7) If the Board of Parole determines that an eligible committed
13 offender is rehabilitated and a good candidate for second chance relief,
14 the board shall make a recommendation to the Board of Pardons that such
15 offender's sentence be commuted.
16 (8)(a) If the Board of Pardons receives a recommendation for second
17 chance relief from the Board of Parole, the Board of Pardons may consider
18 whether to grant a commutation of some or all of the remainder of a
19 committed offender's sentence to a term of parole.
20 (b) If the Board of Pardons determines not to grant a commutation,
21 the board may provide the committed offender with a list of steps or
22 requirements that, if satisfied, would increase the committed offender's
23 chances of being granted a commutation at a subsequent review. The Board
24 of Pardons may also provide a process for seeking a subsequent
25 commutation review.
26 (9) If a committed offender is granted a commutation and paroled
27 under this section, the Board of Parole shall:
28 (a) Develop a detailed reentry plan tailored to the committed
29 offender's needs, including job placement, housing support, and access to
30 continuing education and mental health services;
31 (b) Provide the committed offender with access to mentorship
