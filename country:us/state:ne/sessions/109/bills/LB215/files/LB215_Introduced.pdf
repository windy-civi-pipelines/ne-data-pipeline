1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 10 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Clean Slate Act.
3 Sec. 2. (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (a) After individuals convicted of nonviolent or less violent crimes
5 have served their sentences and obeyed the law long enough to demonstrate
6 their rehabilitation, such individuals' criminal records should not stand
7 as an impediment to the necessities of life, such as employment, housing,
8 and education. However, criminal justice agencies need access to all
9 criminal history record information in order to effectively carry out
10 their duties to protect the public;
11 (b) The state shall provide a clean slate remedy, as set forth under
12 the Clean Slate Act, in order to:
13 (i) Provide an incentive for offenders to remain crime-free;
14 (ii) Provide hope to offenders who are trying to rehabilitate
15 themselves;
16 (iii) Save the state money that must be spent when offenders
17 recidivate; and
18 (iv) Ensure appropriate access to criminal history record
19 information by criminal justice agencies and for other purposes essential
20 to the health and safety of the public; and
21 (c) To the extent possible, the Clean Slate Act should be
22 implemented with low cost to the courts, criminal justice agencies, and
23 individuals seeking relief under the act.
24 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Clean Slate Act, the definitions found
25 in the Security, Privacy, and Dissemination of Criminal History
26 Information Act and sections 4 and 5 of this act apply.
27 Sec. 4. The terms conviction and adjudication:
28 (1) Include a conviction or adjudication following trial or entry of
29 a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere and include a forfeiture of

1 (5) In determining whether an eligible committed offender is
2 rehabilitated and a good candidate for second chance relief, the Board of
3 Parole shall:
4 (a) Complete a risk assessment for the committed offender; and
5 (b) Involve community leaders and stakeholders in the review process
6 to ensure that public safety and community concerns are addressed.
7 (6) If the Board of Parole determines that an eligible committed
8 offender is rehabilitated and a good candidate for second chance relief,
9 the board shall make a recommendation to the Board of Pardons that such
10 offender's sentence be commuted.
11 (7)(a) If the Board of Pardons receives a recommendation for second
12 chance relief from the Board of Parole, the Board of Pardons shall
13 promptly consider whether to grant a commutation of some or all of the
14 remainder of a committed offender's sentence to a term of parole. Such
15 term shall not extend longer than the remainder of the term of
16 imprisonment.
17 (b) If the Board of Pardons determines not to grant a commutation,
18 the board shall provide the committed offender with a list of steps or
19 requirements that the committed offender must satisfy to increase the
20 chances the committed offender will be granted a commutation at a
21 subsequent review. The Board of Pardons shall also provide a process for
22 seeking a subsequent commutation review. Upon completion of such steps or
23 requirements, the committed offender may petition the Board of Pardons to
24 grant a commutation. The Board of Pardons shall review a petition for
25 subsequent review and make a determination within thirty days after
26 receipt of such petition.

28 under this section, the Board of Parole shall:
29 (a) Develop a detailed reentry plan tailored to the committed
30 offender's needs, including job placement, housing support, and access to
31 continuing education and mental health services;

1 (b) Provide the committed offender with access to mentorship
2 programs and community support networks to facilitate successful
3 reintegration into the community;

5 justice programs. The Board of Parole shall offer restorative justice
6 opportunities, when appropriate, to allow the committed offender to make
7 amends with victims and the community; and
8 (d) Provide for accountability and monitoring by requiring regular
9 check-ins with parole officers and continuous monitoring during the
10 initial phase of reentry to ensure compliance with conditions of parole.
11 (9) The Board of Parole shall implement a system for ongoing
12 evaluation and adjustment of the second chance relief program based on
13 outcomes and feedback.
