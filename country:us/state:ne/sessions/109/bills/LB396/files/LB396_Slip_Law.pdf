Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
Section 1. Section 13-516, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

shall include at a minimum: Revenue from all sources separately stated as to
each source and expenditures from the prior two years; estimates of the current
year's revenue from all sources separately stated as to each source and
expenditures; and a summary which outlines the fiscal policy of the district or
agency for the period covered by the budget. Such proposed budget shall be
available for inspection by the general public at each district's or agency's
principal headquarters at least seven days prior to the meeting of the board of
directors at which such budget is to be adopted. The budget shall be in a form
approved by the Nebraska Power Review Board.
Notice of the place and time of such meeting of the board of directors
shall be published at least seven days prior to the date set for such meeting
in a newspaper of general circulation within the district or agency. The notice
shall include a statement that the proposed budget is available for public
inspection and the location where it is available. Any changes to the proposed

budget at the principal headquarters of the district or agency prior to the
board meeting. At such meeting the public shall have an opportunity to testify
before the proposed budget is adopted, and a written record shall be kept of

directors, at the close of each year's business, shall cause an audit of the
books, records, and financial affairs of the district to be made by a certified
public accountant or firm of such accountants, who shall be selected by the
district. The audit shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in section
