MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 2024, is amended to read:
2 77-6833 (1) If the taxpayer fails to maintain employment and
3 investment levels at or above the levels required in the agreement for
4 the entire performance period, all or a portion of the incentives set
5 forth in the ImagiNE Nebraska Act shall be recaptured or disallowed. For
6 purposes of this section, the average compensation and health coverage
7 requirements of subdivision (1)(c) of section 77-6831 shall be treated as
8 a required level of employment for each year of the performance period.
9 (2) In the case of a taxpayer who has failed to maintain the
10 required levels of employment or investment for the entire performance
11 period, any reduction in the personal property tax, any refunds in tax or
12 exemptions from tax allowed under section 77-6831, and any refunds or
13 reduction in tax allowed because of the use of a credit allowed under
14 section 77-6831 shall be partially recaptured from either the taxpayer,
15 the owner of the improvement to real estate, or the qualified employee
16 leasing company, and any carryovers of credits shall be partially
17 disallowed. The amount of the recapture for each benefit shall be a
18 percentage equal to the number of years the taxpayer did not maintain the
19 required levels of investment or employment divided by the number of
20 years of the performance period multiplied by the refunds, exemptions, or
21 reductions in tax allowed, reduction in personal property tax, credits
22 used, and the remaining carryovers. In addition, the last remaining year
23 of personal property tax exemption shall be disallowed for each year the
24 taxpayer did not maintain the qualified location or locations at or above
25 the required levels of employment or investment.
26 (3) If the taxpayer receives any refund, exemption, or reduction in
27 tax to which the taxpayer was not entitled or which was in excess of the
28 amount to which the taxpayer was entitled, the refund, exemption, or
29 reduction in tax shall be recaptured separate from any other recapture
30 otherwise required by this section. Any amount recaptured under this
31 subsection shall be excluded from the amounts subject to recapture under
-34-
AM874 AM874
LB468 LB468
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 other subsections of this section.
2 (4) Any refunds, exemptions, or reduction in tax due, to the extent
3 required to be recaptured, shall be deemed to be an underpayment of the
4 tax and shall be immediately due and payable. When tax benefits were
5 received in more than one year, the tax benefits received in the most
6 recent year shall be recovered first and then the benefits received in
7 earlier years up to the extent of the required recapture.
8 (5)(a) Any personal property tax that would have been due except for
9 the exemption allowed under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act, to the extent it
10 becomes due under this section, shall be considered delinquent and shall
11 be immediately due and payable to the county or counties in which the
12 property was located when exempted.
13 (b) All amounts received by a county under this section shall be
14 allocated to each taxing unit levying taxes on tangible personal property
15 in the county in the same proportion that the levy on tangible personal
16 property of such taxing unit bears to the total levy of all of such
17 taxing units.
18 (6) Notwithstanding any other limitations contained in the laws of
19 this state, collection of any taxes deemed to be underpayments by this
20 section shall be allowed for a period of three years after the end of the
21 performance period or three calendar years after the benefit was allowed,
22 whichever is later.
23 (7) Any amounts due under this section shall be recaptured
24 notwithstanding other allowable credits and shall not be subsequently
25 refunded under any provision of the ImagiNE Nebraska Act unless the
26 recapture was in error.
27 (8) The recapture required by this section shall not occur if the
28 failure to maintain the required levels of employment or investment was
29 caused by an act of God or a national emergency.
30 Sec. 19. The changes made in sections 77-6815, 77-6831, and 77-6833
31 by this legislative bill apply to all applications filed on and after

13 and Building Development Fund available for investment shall be invested
14 by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital
15 Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
16 (2) It is the intent of the Legislature to transfer five million
17 dollars from the General Fund to the Site and Building Development Fund
18 for fiscal year 2022-23 and five million dollars from the General Fund to
19 the Site and Building Development Fund for fiscal year 2023-24. Such
20 money shall be placed in a subaccount of the Site and Building
21 Development Fund and earmarked for use to fund large shovel-ready
22 commercial and industrial sites developed under the Municipal Inland Port
23 Authority Act.
24 (3)(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate five
25 hundred thousand dollars from the Site and Building Development Fund for

27 to conduct a comprehensive study or studies to identify and evaluate
28 large commercial and industrial sites in Nebraska that have the potential
29 to attract major investment and employment opportunities. The study shall

-36-
AM874 AM874
LB468 LB468
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025

5 (b) The study shall assess the potential geographic locations; the
6 infrastructure assets that would be required for each site, including
7 highway, rail, and air transportation, and utilities such as water,
8 wastewater treatment, electrical power, and natural gas; the population
9 within fifty miles of each site and whether such population would be
10 sufficient to provide an adequate workforce for such site; and the
11 appropriate level of state investment necessary to position Nebraska as a
12 nationally or globally competitive location for site selection targeting
13 various sectors, including, but not limited to, advanced manufacturing,
14 trade, bioscience, agribusiness, warehousing and supply chain logistics,
15 technology, aerospace, automotive, clean energy, military support, and
16 life sciences. Such identified state investment levels may include, but
17 are not limited to, land acquisition costs and infrastructure
18 investments. The purpose of the study is to provide strategic insights
19 that will enable the state to attract major investment and employment
20 opportunities in order to support the growth of transformational
21 industries within Nebraska.
22 (c) The Director of Economic Development shall appoint an advisory
23 committee comprised of representatives of Nebraska economic development
24 organizations, equally representing each of Nebraska's three
25 congressional districts, to assist the department in identifying the
26 location of potential and preferred super sites and mega sites.

AMENDMENTS TO LB468
Introduced by Revenue.
1 1. Strike the original sections and insert the following new
2 sections:
3 Section 1. Section 8-1120, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
4 2024, is amended to read:
5 8-1120 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
6 Securities Act of Nebraska shall be administered by the Director of
7 Banking and Finance who may employ such deputies, examiners, assistants,
8 or counsel as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose thereof. The
9 employment of any person for the administration of the act is subject to
10 section 49-1499.07. The director may delegate to a deputy director or
11 counsel any powers, authority, and duties imposed upon or granted to the
12 director under the act, such as may be lawfully delegated under the
13 common law or the statutes of this state. The director may also employ
14 special counsel with respect to any investigation conducted by him or her
15 under the act or with respect to any litigation to which the director is
16 a party under the act.
17 (2) A security issued by and representing an interest in or a debt
18 of, or guaranteed by, any insurance company shall be registered, pursuant
19 to the provisions of sections 8-1104 to 8-1109, with the Director of
20 Insurance who shall as to such registrations administer and enforce the
21 act, and as pertains to the administration and enforcement of such
22 registration of such securities all references in the act to director
23 shall mean the Director of Insurance.
24 (3)(a) It shall be unlawful for the director or any of his or her
25 employees to use for personal benefit any information which is filed with
26 or obtained by the director and which is not made public. Neither the
27 director nor any of his or her employees shall disclose any confidential
-1-

AM874 AM874
LB468 LB468
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 information except among themselves, when necessary or appropriate in a
2 proceeding, examination, or investigation under the act, or as authorized
3 in subdivision (3)(b) of this subsection. No provision of the act shall
4 either create or derogate from any privilege which exists at common law
5 or otherwise when documentary or other evidence is sought under a
6 subpoena directed to the director or any of his or her employees.
7 (b)(i) In administering the act, the director may also:
8 (A) Enter into agreements or relationships with other government
9 officials, including, but not limited to, the securities administrator of
10 a foreign state and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or self-
11 regulatory organizations, to share resources, standardized or uniform
12 methods or procedures, and documents, records, and information; or
13 (B) Accept and rely on examination or investigation reports made by
14 other government officials, including, but not limited to, the securities
15 administrator of a foreign state and the Securities and Exchange
16 Commission, or self-regulatory organizations.
17 (ii) For purposes of this subdivision, foreign state means any state
18 of the United States, other than the State of Nebraska, any territory of
19 the United States, including Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust
20 Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Virgin Islands, and the District
21 of Columbia.
22 (4) The director may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations and
23 prescribe forms to carry out the act. No rule and regulation may be
24 adopted and promulgated or form may be prescribed unless the director
25 finds that the action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest
26 or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes
27 fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act. In adopting and
28 promulgating rules and regulations and prescribing forms the director may
29 cooperate with the securities administrators of the other states and the
30 Securities and Exchange Commission with a view to effectuating the policy
31 of the Securities Act of Nebraska to achieve maximum uniformity in the

1 form and content of registration statements, applications, and reports
2 wherever practicable. All rules and regulations and forms of the director
3 shall be published and made available to any person upon request.
4 (5) No provision of the act imposing any liability shall apply to
5 any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule and
6 regulation, form, or order of the director, notwithstanding that the rule
7 and regulation or form may later be amended or rescinded or be determined
8 by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.
9 (6) Every hearing in an administrative proceeding shall be public
10 unless the director in his or her discretion grants a request joined in
11 by all the respondents that the hearing be conducted privately.
12 (7)(a) The Securities Act Cash Fund is created. All filing fees,
13 registration fees, and all other fees and all money collected by or paid

15 to the State Treasurer for credit to the fund, except that registration
16 fees collected by or paid to the Director of Insurance pursuant to the
17 provisions of the act shall be credited to the Department of Insurance
18 Cash Fund. The Securities Act Cash Fund shall be used for the purpose of
19 administering and enforcing the provisions of the act, except that
20 transfers may be made to the General Fund at the direction of the
21 Legislature and distributions to counties may be made as provided in
22 subdivision (7)(c) of this section. Any money in the Securities Act Cash
23 Fund available for investment shall be invested by the state investment
24 officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska
25 State Funds Investment Act.

12 Services.
13 (c) Beginning July 1, 2025, the State Treasurer shall distribute
14 five million dollars annually from the Securities Act Cash Fund to the
15 counties proportionately in the proportion that the total taxable
16 valuation of all real and personal property in the county bears to the
17 total taxable valuation of all real and personal property in the state.
18 (8) A document is filed when it is received by the director. The
19 director shall keep a register of all applications for registration and
20 registration statements which are or have ever been effective under the
21 Securities Act of Nebraska and all denial, suspension, or revocation

13 any document authorized by the county board or required by the
14 departments of the state; or for recording Army or Navy discharges or

1 subdivision (8)(c) of this section, the taxpayer shall annually file a
2 claim for exemption with the Tax Commissioner on or before May 1. The
3 form and supporting schedules shall be prescribed by the Tax Commissioner
4 and shall list all property for which exemption is being sought under
5 this section. A separate claim for exemption must be filed for each
6 agreement and each county in which property is claimed to be exempt. A
7 copy of this form must also be filed with the county assessor in each
8 county in which the applicant is requesting exemption. The Tax
9 Commissioner shall determine whether a taxpayer is eligible to obtain
10 exemption for personal property based on the criteria for exemption and
11 the eligibility of each item listed for exemption and, on or before
12 August 1, certify such determination to the taxpayer and to the affected
13 county assessor.
14 (9) The taxpayer shall, on or before the receipt or use of any
15 incentives under this section, pay to the director a fee of one-half
16 percent of such incentives, except for the exemption on personal
17 property, for administering the ImagiNE Nebraska Act, except that the fee
18 on any sales tax exemption may be paid by the taxpayer with the filing of
19 its sales and use tax return. Such fee may be paid by direct payment to
20 the director or through withholding of available refunds. A credit shall
21 be allowed against such fee for the amount of the fee paid with the
22 application. All fees collected under this subsection shall be remitted
23 to the State Treasurer for credit to the ImagiNE Nebraska Cash Fund,
24 which fund is hereby created. The fund shall consist of fees credited
25 under this subsection and any other money appropriated to the fund by the
26 Legislature. The fund shall be administered by the Department of Economic
27 Development and shall be used for administration of the ImagiNE Nebraska
28 Act. Any money in the fund available for investment shall be invested by
29 the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion
30 Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.

AM874 AM874
LB468 LB468
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 2024, is amended to read:
2 77-6833 (1) If the taxpayer fails to maintain employment and
3 investment levels at or above the levels required in the agreement for
4 the entire performance period, all or a portion of the incentives set
5 forth in the ImagiNE Nebraska Act shall be recaptured or disallowed. For
6 purposes of this section, the average compensation and health coverage
7 requirements of subdivision (1)(c) of section 77-6831 shall be treated as
8 a required level of employment for each year of the performance period.
9 (2) In the case of a taxpayer who has failed to maintain the
10 required levels of employment or investment for the entire performance
11 period, any reduction in the personal property tax, any refunds in tax or
12 exemptions from tax allowed under section 77-6831, and any refunds or
13 reduction in tax allowed because of the use of a credit allowed under
14 section 77-6831 shall be partially recaptured from either the taxpayer,
15 the owner of the improvement to real estate, or the qualified employee
16 leasing company, and any carryovers of credits shall be partially
17 disallowed. The amount of the recapture for each benefit shall be a
18 percentage equal to the number of years the taxpayer did not maintain the
19 required levels of investment or employment divided by the number of
20 years of the performance period multiplied by the refunds, exemptions, or
21 reductions in tax allowed, reduction in personal property tax, credits
22 used, and the remaining carryovers. In addition, the last remaining year
23 of personal property tax exemption shall be disallowed for each year the
24 taxpayer did not maintain the qualified location or locations at or above
25 the required levels of employment or investment.
26 (3) If the taxpayer receives any refund, exemption, or reduction in
27 tax to which the taxpayer was not entitled or which was in excess of the
28 amount to which the taxpayer was entitled, the refund, exemption, or
29 reduction in tax shall be recaptured separate from any other recapture
30 otherwise required by this section. Any amount recaptured under this
31 subsection shall be excluded from the amounts subject to recapture under
-34-

LB468 LB468
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 other subsections of this section.
2 (4) Any refunds, exemptions, or reduction in tax due, to the extent
3 required to be recaptured, shall be deemed to be an underpayment of the
4 tax and shall be immediately due and payable. When tax benefits were
5 received in more than one year, the tax benefits received in the most
6 recent year shall be recovered first and then the benefits received in
7 earlier years up to the extent of the required recapture.
8 (5)(a) Any personal property tax that would have been due except for
9 the exemption allowed under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act, to the extent it
10 becomes due under this section, shall be considered delinquent and shall
11 be immediately due and payable to the county or counties in which the
12 property was located when exempted.
13 (b) All amounts received by a county under this section shall be
14 allocated to each taxing unit levying taxes on tangible personal property
15 in the county in the same proportion that the levy on tangible personal
16 property of such taxing unit bears to the total levy of all of such
17 taxing units.
18 (6) Notwithstanding any other limitations contained in the laws of
19 this state, collection of any taxes deemed to be underpayments by this
20 section shall be allowed for a period of three years after the end of the
21 performance period or three calendar years after the benefit was allowed,
22 whichever is later.
23 (7) Any amounts due under this section shall be recaptured
24 notwithstanding other allowable credits and shall not be subsequently
25 refunded under any provision of the ImagiNE Nebraska Act unless the
26 recapture was in error.
27 (8) The recapture required by this section shall not occur if the
28 failure to maintain the required levels of employment or investment was
29 caused by an act of God or a national emergency.
30 Sec. 19. The changes made in sections 77-6815, 77-6831, and 77-6833
31 by this legislative bill apply to all applications filed on and after

4 Sec. 20. Section 81-12,146, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 81-12,146 (1) The Site and Building Development Fund is created. The
7 fund shall receive money pursuant to section 76-903 and may include
8 revenue from transfers by the Legislature, grants, private contributions,
9 repayment of loans, and all other sources. The Department of Economic
10 Development, as part of its comprehensive business development strategy,
11 shall administer the fund. Transfers may be made from the fund to the
12 General Fund at the direction of the Legislature. Any money in the Site
13 and Building Development Fund available for investment shall be invested
14 by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital
15 Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
16 (2) It is the intent of the Legislature to transfer five million
17 dollars from the General Fund to the Site and Building Development Fund
18 for fiscal year 2022-23 and five million dollars from the General Fund to
19 the Site and Building Development Fund for fiscal year 2023-24. Such
20 money shall be placed in a subaccount of the Site and Building
21 Development Fund and earmarked for use to fund large shovel-ready
22 commercial and industrial sites developed under the Municipal Inland Port
23 Authority Act.
24 (3)(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate five
25 hundred thousand dollars from the Site and Building Development Fund for
26 fiscal year 2024-25 to the department to enter into one or more contracts
27 to conduct a comprehensive study or studies to identify and evaluate
28 large commercial and industrial sites in Nebraska that have the potential
29 to attract major investment and employment opportunities. The study shall
30 include consideration of super sites that encompass between five hundred
31 and one thousand acres and mega sites that encompass more than one
-36-

AM874 AM874
LB468 LB468
MLU - 04/02/2025 MLU - 04/02/2025
1 thousand acres. At least one proposed site shall be located west of the
2 one hundredth meridian in Nebraska. The contracts shall be awarded based
3 on a competitive selection process as determined by the department. The
4 studies shall be completed no later than December 15, 2024.
5 (b) The study shall assess the potential geographic locations; the
6 infrastructure assets that would be required for each site, including
7 highway, rail, and air transportation, and utilities such as water,
8 wastewater treatment, electrical power, and natural gas; the population
9 within fifty miles of each site and whether such population would be
10 sufficient to provide an adequate workforce for such site; and the
11 appropriate level of state investment necessary to position Nebraska as a
12 nationally or globally competitive location for site selection targeting
13 various sectors, including, but not limited to, advanced manufacturing,
14 trade, bioscience, agribusiness, warehousing and supply chain logistics,
15 technology, aerospace, automotive, clean energy, military support, and
16 life sciences. Such identified state investment levels may include, but
17 are not limited to, land acquisition costs and infrastructure
18 investments. The purpose of the study is to provide strategic insights
19 that will enable the state to attract major investment and employment
20 opportunities in order to support the growth of transformational
21 industries within Nebraska.
22 (c) The Director of Economic Development shall appoint an advisory
23 committee comprised of representatives of Nebraska economic development
24 organizations, equally representing each of Nebraska's three
25 congressional districts, to assist the department in identifying the
26 location of potential and preferred super sites and mega sites.
