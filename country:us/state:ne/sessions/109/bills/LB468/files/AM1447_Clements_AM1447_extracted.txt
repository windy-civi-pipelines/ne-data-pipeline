12 energy generation facility was not decommissioned or was operational.
13 (iv) When the capacity of a renewable energy generation facility to
14 produce electricity is reduced but the renewable energy generation
15 facility is not decommissioned, the nameplate capacity of the renewable

17 (6)(a) On March 1 of each year, the owner of a renewable energy
18 generation facility shall file with the Department of Revenue a report on
19 the nameplate capacity of the facility for the previous year from January
20 1 through December 31. All taxes shall be due on April 1 and shall be
21 delinquent if not paid on a quarterly basis on April 1 and each quarter
22 thereafter. Delinquent quarterly payments shall draw interest at the rate
23 provided for in section 45-104.02, as such rate may from time to time be
24 adjusted.

7 (9) The Department of Revenue shall separately identify the proceeds
8 from the tax imposed by this section and shall: pay all
9 (a) Distribute thirty percent of such proceeds to the counties
10 proportionately in the proportion that the total taxable valuation of all
11 real and personal property in the county bears to the total taxable
12 valuation of all real and personal property in the state; and
13 (b) Pay the remaining seventy percent of such proceeds over to the
14 county treasurer of the county where the renewable energy generation
15 facility is located.
16 (10) The Department of Revenue shall distribute and pay over the tax

21 77-6204 (1) The county treasurer shall distribute all revenue
22 received from the Department of Revenue pursuant to subdivision (9)(b) of

24 property tax exemption, would have received distribution of personal
25 property tax revenue from depreciable personal property used directly in
26 the generation of electricity using wind, solar, biomass, or landfill gas
27 as the fuel source.
28 (2) A local taxing entity's status as eligible for distribution
29 under subsection (1) of this section shall not be affected when and if
30 the net book value of personal property used directly in the generation
31 of electricity using wind, solar, biomass, or landfill gas as the fuel
-15-

1 source becomes zero. A local taxing entity's status as eligible for
2 distribution under such subsection shall be affected by the disposal of
3 all of the exempt depreciable personal property used directly in the
4 generation of electricity using wind, solar, biomass, or landfill gas as
5 the fuel source.
6 (3) The distribution to each eligible local taxing entity shall be
7 calculated by determining the amount of taxes that the eligible local
8 taxing entity levied during the taxable year and dividing this amount by
9 the total tax levied by all of the eligible local taxing entities during
10 the year. Each eligible entity's resulting fraction shall then be
11 multiplied by the revenue distributed to the county treasurer by the
12 department to determine the portion of such revenue due each local taxing
13 entity.
14 (4) The Department of Revenue shall not retain any revenue collected
15 pursuant to sections 77-6201 to 77-6204 for distribution, use, transfer,
16 pledge, or allocation to or from the General Fund.
17 Sec. 13. The Inheritance Tax Distribution Fund is hereby created.
18 The fund shall consist of transfers authorized by the Legislature. The
19 State Treasurer shall distribute funds annually to counties
20 proportionately in the proportion that the total taxable valuation of all
21 real and personal property in the county bears to the total taxable
22 valuation of all real and personal property in the state. Any money in
23 the fund available for investment shall be invested by the state
24 investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the
25 Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
26 Sec. 14. This act becomes operative on July 1, 2025.

Introduced by Clements, 2.
1 1. Strike the original sections and all amendments thereto and
2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Section 8-1120, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
4 2024, is amended to read:
5 8-1120 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
6 Securities Act of Nebraska shall be administered by the Director of
7 Banking and Finance who may employ such deputies, examiners, assistants,
8 or counsel as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose thereof. The
9 employment of any person for the administration of the act is subject to
10 section 49-1499.07. The director may delegate to a deputy director or
11 counsel any powers, authority, and duties imposed upon or granted to the
12 director under the act, such as may be lawfully delegated under the
13 common law or the statutes of this state. The director may also employ
14 special counsel with respect to any investigation conducted by him or her
15 under the act or with respect to any litigation to which the director is
16 a party under the act.
17 (2) A security issued by and representing an interest in or a debt
18 of, or guaranteed by, any insurance company shall be registered, pursuant
19 to the provisions of sections 8-1104 to 8-1109, with the Director of
20 Insurance who shall as to such registrations administer and enforce the
21 act, and as pertains to the administration and enforcement of such
22 registration of such securities all references in the act to director
23 shall mean the Director of Insurance.
24 (3)(a) It shall be unlawful for the director or any of his or her
25 employees to use for personal benefit any information which is filed with

1 information except among themselves, when necessary or appropriate in a
2 proceeding, examination, or investigation under the act, or as authorized
3 in subdivision (3)(b) of this subsection. No provision of the act shall
4 either create or derogate from any privilege which exists at common law
5 or otherwise when documentary or other evidence is sought under a
6 subpoena directed to the director or any of his or her employees.
7 (b)(i) In administering the act, the director may also:
8 (A) Enter into agreements or relationships with other government
9 officials, including, but not limited to, the securities administrator of
10 a foreign state and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or self-
11 regulatory organizations, to share resources, standardized or uniform
12 methods or procedures, and documents, records, and information; or
13 (B) Accept and rely on examination or investigation reports made by
14 other government officials, including, but not limited to, the securities
15 administrator of a foreign state and the Securities and Exchange
16 Commission, or self-regulatory organizations.

20 Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Virgin Islands, and the District
21 of Columbia.

23 prescribe forms to carry out the act. No rule and regulation may be
24 adopted and promulgated or form may be prescribed unless the director
25 finds that the action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest
26 or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes
27 fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act. In adopting and
28 promulgating rules and regulations and prescribing forms the director may
29 cooperate with the securities administrators of the other states and the
30 Securities and Exchange Commission with a view to effectuating the policy
31 of the Securities Act of Nebraska to achieve maximum uniformity in the

2 wherever practicable. All rules and regulations and forms of the director
3 shall be published and made available to any person upon request.
4 (5) No provision of the act imposing any liability shall apply to
5 any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule and

7 and regulation or form may later be amended or rescinded or be determined
8 by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.

22 Distribution Fund as provided in subdivision (7)(c) of this section. Any
