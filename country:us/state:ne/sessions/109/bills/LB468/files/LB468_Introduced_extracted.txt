6 comprehensive assessment ratio studies of the average level of
7 assessment, the degree of assessment uniformity, and the overall

12 statistical analysis as deemed appropriate by the Property Tax
13 Administrator, including measures of central tendency and dispersion. The

17 quality of assessment for purposes of section 77-5027 and by the Property
18 Tax Administrator in establishing the adjusted valuations required by

21 (4) For purposes of determining the level of value of agricultural
22 and horticultural land subject to special valuation under sections

-33-
LB468 LB468
2025 2025
1 this section. A separate claim for exemption must be filed for each
2 agreement and each county in which property is claimed to be exempt. A
3 copy of this form must also be filed with the county assessor in each
4 county in which the applicant is requesting exemption. The Tax
5 Commissioner shall determine whether a taxpayer is eligible to obtain
6 exemption for personal property based on the criteria for exemption and
7 the eligibility of each item listed for exemption and, on or before
8 August 1, certify such determination to the taxpayer and to the affected
9 county assessor.
10 (9) The taxpayer shall, on or before the receipt or use of any
11 incentives under this section, pay to the director a fee of one-half
12 percent of such incentives, except for the exemption on personal
13 property, for administering the ImagiNE Nebraska Act, except that the fee
14 on any sales tax exemption may be paid by the taxpayer with the filing of
15 its sales and use tax return. Such fee may be paid by direct payment to
16 the director or through withholding of available refunds. A credit shall
17 be allowed against such fee for the amount of the fee paid with the
18 application. All fees collected under this subsection shall be remitted
19 to the State Treasurer for credit to the ImagiNE Nebraska Cash Fund,
20 which fund is hereby created. The fund shall consist of fees credited

27 Sec. 17. Section 77-6833, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,

30 investment levels at or above the levels required in the agreement for
31 the entire performance period, all or a portion of the incentives set
-34-
LB468 LB468
2025 2025
1 forth in the ImagiNE Nebraska Act shall be recaptured or disallowed. For
2 purposes of this section, the average compensation and health coverage
3 requirements of subdivision (1)(c) of section 77-6831 shall be treated as
4 a required level of employment for each year of the performance period.
5 (2) In the case of a taxpayer who has failed to maintain the
6 required levels of employment or investment for the entire performance
7 period, any reduction in the personal property tax, any refunds in tax or
8 exemptions from tax allowed under section 77-6831, and any refunds or
9 reduction in tax allowed because of the use of a credit allowed under
10 section 77-6831 shall be partially recaptured from either the taxpayer,
11 the owner of the improvement to real estate, or the qualified employee
12 leasing company, and any carryovers of credits shall be partially
13 disallowed. The amount of the recapture for each benefit shall be a
14 percentage equal to the number of years the taxpayer did not maintain the
15 required levels of investment or employment divided by the number of
16 years of the performance period multiplied by the refunds, exemptions, or
17 reductions in tax allowed, reduction in personal property tax, credits
18 used, and the remaining carryovers. In addition, the last remaining year
19 of personal property tax exemption shall be disallowed for each year the
20 taxpayer did not maintain the qualified location or locations at or above
21 the required levels of employment or investment.
22 (3) If the taxpayer receives any refund, exemption, or reduction in
23 tax to which the taxpayer was not entitled or which was in excess of the
24 amount to which the taxpayer was entitled, the refund, exemption, or
25 reduction in tax shall be recaptured separate from any other recapture
26 otherwise required by this section. Any amount recaptured under this
27 subsection shall be excluded from the amounts subject to recapture under
28 other subsections of this section.
29 (4) Any refunds, exemptions, or reduction in tax due, to the extent
30 required to be recaptured, shall be deemed to be an underpayment of the
31 tax and shall be immediately due and payable. When tax benefits were
-35-
LB468 LB468
2025 2025
1 received in more than one year, the tax benefits received in the most
2 recent year shall be recovered first and then the benefits received in
3 earlier years up to the extent of the required recapture.
4 (5)(a) Any personal property tax that would have been due except for
5 the exemption allowed under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act, to the extent it
6 becomes due under this section, shall be considered delinquent and shall
7 be immediately due and payable to the county or counties in which the
8 property was located when exempted.
9 (b) All amounts received by a county under this section shall be
10 allocated to each taxing unit levying taxes on tangible personal property
11 in the county in the same proportion that the levy on tangible personal
12 property of such taxing unit bears to the total levy of all of such
13 taxing units.
14 (6) Notwithstanding any other limitations contained in the laws of
15 this state, collection of any taxes deemed to be underpayments by this
16 section shall be allowed for a period of three years after the end of the
17 performance period or three calendar years after the benefit was allowed,
18 whichever is later.
19 (7) Any amounts due under this section shall be recaptured
20 notwithstanding other allowable credits and shall not be subsequently
21 refunded under any provision of the ImagiNE Nebraska Act unless the
22 recapture was in error.
23 (8) The recapture required by this section shall not occur if the
24 failure to maintain the required levels of employment or investment was
25 caused by an act of God or a national emergency.
26 Sec. 18. Section 81-12,146, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

30 revenue from transfers by the Legislature, grants, private contributions,
31 repayment of loans, and all other sources. The Department of Economic
-36-
LB468 LB468
2025 2025
1 Development, as part of its comprehensive business development strategy,
2 shall administer the fund. Transfers may be made from the fund to the
3 General Fund at the direction of the Legislature. Any money in the Site
4 and Building Development Fund available for investment shall be invested
5 by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital
6 Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
7 (2) It is the intent of the Legislature to transfer five million
8 dollars from the General Fund to the Site and Building Development Fund
9 for fiscal year 2022-23 and five million dollars from the General Fund to
10 the Site and Building Development Fund for fiscal year 2023-24. Such
11 money shall be placed in a subaccount of the Site and Building
12 Development Fund and earmarked for use to fund large shovel-ready
13 commercial and industrial sites developed under the Municipal Inland Port
14 Authority Act.
15 (3)(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate five
16 hundred thousand dollars from the Site and Building Development Fund for
17 fiscal year 2024-25 to the department to enter into one or more contracts
18 to conduct a comprehensive study or studies to identify and evaluate
19 large commercial and industrial sites in Nebraska that have the potential
20 to attract major investment and employment opportunities. The study shall
21 include consideration of super sites that encompass between five hundred
22 and one thousand acres and mega sites that encompass more than one
23 thousand acres. At least one proposed site shall be located west of the
24 one hundredth meridian in Nebraska. The contracts shall be awarded based
25 on a competitive selection process as determined by the department. The
26 studies shall be completed no later than December 15, 2024.
27 (b) The study shall assess the potential geographic locations; the
28 infrastructure assets that would be required for each site, including
29 highway, rail, and air transportation, and utilities such as water,
30 wastewater treatment, electrical power, and natural gas; the population
31 within fifty miles of each site and whether such population would be
-37-
LB468 LB468
2025 2025
1 sufficient to provide an adequate workforce for such site; and the
2 appropriate level of state investment necessary to position Nebraska as a
3 nationally or globally competitive location for site selection targeting
4 various sectors, including, but not limited to, advanced manufacturing,
5 trade, bioscience, agribusiness, warehousing and supply chain logistics,
6 technology, aerospace, automotive, clean energy, military support, and
7 life sciences. Such identified state investment levels may include, but
8 are not limited to, land acquisition costs and infrastructure
9 investments. The purpose of the study is to provide strategic insights
10 that will enable the state to attract major investment and employment
11 opportunities in order to support the growth of transformational
12 industries within Nebraska.
13 (c) The Director of Economic Development shall appoint an advisory
14 committee comprised of representatives of Nebraska economic development
15 organizations, equally representing each of Nebraska's three
16 congressional districts, to assist the department in identifying the
17 location of potential and preferred super sites and mega sites.

7 employment of any person for the administration of the act is subject to
8 section 49-1499.07. The director may delegate to a deputy director or

1 received in more than one year, the tax benefits received in the most
2 recent year shall be recovered first and then the benefits received in
3 earlier years up to the extent of the required recapture.
4 (5)(a) Any personal property tax that would have been due except for
5 the exemption allowed under the ImagiNE Nebraska Act, to the extent it
6 becomes due under this section, shall be considered delinquent and shall
7 be immediately due and payable to the county or counties in which the
8 property was located when exempted.
9 (b) All amounts received by a county under this section shall be
10 allocated to each taxing unit levying taxes on tangible personal property
11 in the county in the same proportion that the levy on tangible personal
12 property of such taxing unit bears to the total levy of all of such
13 taxing units.
14 (6) Notwithstanding any other limitations contained in the laws of
15 this state, collection of any taxes deemed to be underpayments by this
16 section shall be allowed for a period of three years after the end of the
17 performance period or three calendar years after the benefit was allowed,
18 whichever is later.
19 (7) Any amounts due under this section shall be recaptured
20 notwithstanding other allowable credits and shall not be subsequently
21 refunded under any provision of the ImagiNE Nebraska Act unless the
22 recapture was in error.
23 (8) The recapture required by this section shall not occur if the
24 failure to maintain the required levels of employment or investment was

1 Development, as part of its comprehensive business development strategy,
2 shall administer the fund. Transfers may be made from the fund to the
3 General Fund at the direction of the Legislature. Any money in the Site
4 and Building Development Fund available for investment shall be invested
5 by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital
6 Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.
7 (2) It is the intent of the Legislature to transfer five million
8 dollars from the General Fund to the Site and Building Development Fund
9 for fiscal year 2022-23 and five million dollars from the General Fund to
10 the Site and Building Development Fund for fiscal year 2023-24. Such
11 money shall be placed in a subaccount of the Site and Building
12 Development Fund and earmarked for use to fund large shovel-ready
13 commercial and industrial sites developed under the Municipal Inland Port
14 Authority Act.
15 (3)(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to appropriate five
16 hundred thousand dollars from the Site and Building Development Fund for
17 fiscal year 2024-25 to the department to enter into one or more contracts
18 to conduct a comprehensive study or studies to identify and evaluate
19 large commercial and industrial sites in Nebraska that have the potential
20 to attract major investment and employment opportunities. The study shall
21 include consideration of super sites that encompass between five hundred
22 and one thousand acres and mega sites that encompass more than one
23 thousand acres. At least one proposed site shall be located west of the
24 one hundredth meridian in Nebraska. The contracts shall be awarded based
25 on a competitive selection process as determined by the department. The
26 studies shall be completed no later than December 15, 2024.
27 (b) The study shall assess the potential geographic locations; the
28 infrastructure assets that would be required for each site, including
29 highway, rail, and air transportation, and utilities such as water,
30 wastewater treatment, electrical power, and natural gas; the population
31 within fifty miles of each site and whether such population would be

1 sufficient to provide an adequate workforce for such site; and the
2 appropriate level of state investment necessary to position Nebraska as a
3 nationally or globally competitive location for site selection targeting
4 various sectors, including, but not limited to, advanced manufacturing,
5 trade, bioscience, agribusiness, warehousing and supply chain logistics,
6 technology, aerospace, automotive, clean energy, military support, and
7 life sciences. Such identified state investment levels may include, but
8 are not limited to, land acquisition costs and infrastructure
9 investments. The purpose of the study is to provide strategic insights
10 that will enable the state to attract major investment and employment
11 opportunities in order to support the growth of transformational
12 industries within Nebraska.
13 (c) The Director of Economic Development shall appoint an advisory
14 committee comprised of representatives of Nebraska economic development
15 organizations, equally representing each of Nebraska's three
16 congressional districts, to assist the department in identifying the
17 location of potential and preferred super sites and mega sites.
