examine the concentration and impact of nonprofit organizations in historically
marginalized communities, specifically North and South Omaha. This study will
explore how the development of a nonprofit industrial complex, a system in
which nonprofit organizations operate in ways that often maintain existing
power structures and rely heavily on philanthropic or government funding, may
be hindering sustainable economic growth and upward mobility for residents of
historically marginalized communities. The study shall include, but is not
limited to, the following:
(1) The geographic density and types of nonprofit organizations operating
in North and South Omaha;
(2) The role of nonprofit organizations in shaping local economies,
employment pipelines, and community development efforts;
(3) The extent to which nonprofit organization programming aligns with the
expressed needs of residents and how outcomes are measured;
(4) Whether nonprofit organizations are displacing or duplicating the
roles of local businesses, grassroots organizations, or public institutions;
(5) The funding landscape, including public and philanthropic investments,
and the accountability and transparency measures tied to such funding;
(6) The governance structure of major nonprofit organizations, including
levels of community representation on boards and in executive leadership; and
(7) How the nonprofit industrial complex may perpetuate dependency, dilute
authentic community leadership, and inhibit long-term systemic change.
In conducting this interim study, the Urban Affairs Committee may confer
