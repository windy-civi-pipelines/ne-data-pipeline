affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any

conferred on that state by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date
of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of
obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after
all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to
suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the

obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.

State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of
such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all Licenses
granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of

found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless
agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.

petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or
the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including

action against a Member State in default in the United States District Court

its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact
and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
-7-

LB84 LB84

party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
federal law or the defaulting Member State's law.
2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Commission in the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought
may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce this Compact against
the Commission.
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
1. On or after the effective date of the Compact indicated above, the
Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the Charter Member
States to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is
materially different than the model Compact statute.
a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially
different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default
process set forth in Section 10.
b. If any Member State is later found to be in default or is terminated or
withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and the
Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be
less than seven.
2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter Member
States shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection 7.C.22 to
determine if their enactments are materially different from the model Compact
statute and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.
3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance
of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective
date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered
to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the
Commission.
a. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial
adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as
they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule
that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force
and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
b. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute
repealing the same.
B. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred
eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute.
C. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
withdrawing State's Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and
Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective
date of withdrawal.
D. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State
shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within
that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary,
such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted
pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of such
notice of withdrawal.
1. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or
prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a
Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions
of this Compact.
2. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this
Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is
enacted into the laws of all Member States.
SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be
liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, implementation, and
administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing
or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the
Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase,
clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, a State
seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the
applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is
held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other
government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
C. Notwithstanding subsection 12.B, the Commission may deny a State's
participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of
subsection 10.B, terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it
determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material
departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be
contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in
full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and

effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.
SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other
law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the
conflict.
C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member States
are binding in accordance with their terms.
Sec. 2. Section 38-3113, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, is
amended to read:
38-3113 Nothing in the Psychology Practice Act shall be construed to
prevent:
(1) The teaching of psychology, the conduct of psychological research, or
the provision of psychological services or consultation to organizations or
institutions if such teaching, research, or service does not involve the
delivery or supervision of direct psychological services to individuals or
groups of individuals who are themselves, rather than a third party, the
intended beneficiaries of such services, without regard to the source or extent
of payment for services rendered. Nothing in the act shall prevent the
provision of expert testimony by psychologists who are otherwise exempted by
the act. Persons holding a doctoral degree in psychology from an institution of
higher education may use the title psychologist in conjunction with the
activities permitted by this subdivision;
(2) Members of other recognized professions that are licensed, certified,
or regulated under the laws of this state from rendering services consistent
with their professional training and code of ethics and within the scope of
practice as set out in the statutes regulating their professional practice if
they do not represent themselves to be psychologists;
(3) Duly recognized members of the clergy from functioning in their
ministerial capacity if they do not represent themselves to be psychologists or
their services as psychological;
(4) Persons who are certified as school psychologists by the State Board
of Education or who hold an Equivalent License under the School Psychologist
Interstate Licensure Compact from using the title school psychologist and
practicing psychology as defined in the Psychology Practice Act if (a) such
practice is restricted to regular employment within a setting under the
jurisdiction of the State Board of Education. Such individuals shall be
employees of the educational setting and not independent contractors providing
psychological services to educational settings, or (b) employed through a
service agency with special education programs and rates approved by the State
Department of Education; or
(5) Any of the following persons from engaging in activities defined as
the practice of psychology if they do not represent themselves by the title
psychologist, if they do not use terms other than psychological trainee,
psychological intern, psychological resident, or psychological assistant to
refer to themselves, and if they perform their activities under the supervision
and responsibility of a psychologist in accordance with the rules and
regulations adopted and promulgated under the Psychology Practice Act:
(a) A matriculated graduate student in psychology whose activities
constitute a part of the course of study for a graduate degree in psychology at
an institution of higher education;
(b) An individual pursuing postdoctoral training or experience in
psychology, including persons seeking to fulfill the requirements for licensure
under the act; or
(c) An individual with a master's degree in clinical, counseling, or
educational psychology or an educational specialist degree in school psychology
who administers and scores and may develop interpretations of psychological
testing under the supervision of a psychologist. Such individuals shall be
deemed to be conducting their duties as an extension of the legal and
professional authority of the supervising psychologist and shall not
independently provide interpretive information or treatment recommendations to
clients or other health care professionals prior to obtaining appropriate
supervision. The department, with the recommendation of the board, may adopt
and promulgate rules and regulations governing the conduct and supervision of
persons referred to in this subdivision, including the number of such persons
that may be supervised by a licensed psychologist. Persons who have carried out
the duties described in this subdivision as part of their employment in
institutions accredited by the Department of Health and Human Services, the
State Department of Education, or the Department of Correctional Services for a
period of two years prior to September 1, 1994, may use the title psychologist
associate in the context of their employment in such settings. Use of the title
shall be restricted to duties described in this subdivision, and the title
shall be used in its entirety. Partial or abbreviated use of the title and use
of the title beyond what is specifically authorized in this subdivision shall
constitute the unlicensed practice of psychology.
Sec. 3. Original section 38-3113, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2024, is repealed.
