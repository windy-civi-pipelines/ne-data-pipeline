19 6. The presence of investigative information; and
20 7. Other information that may facilitate the administration of this
21 Compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the Rules of
22 the Commission.
23 C. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed or construed to alter,
24 limit, or inhibit the power of a Member State to control and maintain
25 ownership of its Licensee information or alter, limit, or inhibit the
26 laws or regulations governing Licensee information in the Member State.
27 SECTION 9. RULEMAKING

31 each Rule or amendment.
-17-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 B. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules to achieve the
2 intent and purpose of this Compact. In the event the Commission exercises
3 its Rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond purpose and intent of
4 this Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the
5 Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect of law in the
6 Member States.
7 C. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a
8 Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
9 adopt the Compact within four years of the date of adoption of the Rule,
10 then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member
11 State.
12 D. Rules or amendments to the Rules shall be adopted or ratified at
13 a regular or special meeting of the Commission in accordance with
14 Commission Rules and Bylaws.
15 E. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final Rule or Rules by
16 the Commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at
17 which the Rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall
18 file a notice of proposed rulemaking:
19 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible
20 platform; and
21 2. On the website of each Member State Licensing Authority or other
22 publicly accessible platform or the publication in which each State would
23 otherwise publish proposed Rules.
24 F. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
25 consider and adopt an emergency Rule with forty-eight hours' notice, with
26 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures
27 shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably
28 possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of
29 the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one
30 that must be adopted immediately in order to:
31 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
-18-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
2 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative Rule
3 that is established by federal law or Rule; or
4 4. Protect public health and safety.
5 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
6 A. Oversight
7 1. The executive and judicial branches of the State government in
8 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
9 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
10 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
11 Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
12 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
13 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
14 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
15 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
16 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for
17 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
18 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
19 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact
20 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
21 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall
22 render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or
23 promulgated Rules.
24 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
25 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in
26 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact
27 or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to
28 the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the default,
29 the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the
30 Commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical
31 assistance regarding the default.
-19-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to
2 the other Member States.
3 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
4 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
5 supermajority of the delegates of the Member States, and all rights,
6 privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this Compact may be
7 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
8 does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities
9 incurred during the period of default.
10 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only
11 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
12 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
13 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's
14 legislature, the defaulting State's Licensing Authority, and each of the
15 Member States' Licensing Authorities.
16 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
17 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective
18 date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
19 effective date of termination.
20 F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact,
21 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that
22 State of such termination. The terminated State shall continue to
23 recognize all Licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of
24 six months after the date of the notice of termination.
25 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that
26 is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact,
27 unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting
28 State.
29 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by
30 petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
31 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices.
-20-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
2 including reasonable attorney's fees.
3 I. Dispute Resolution
4 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to
5 resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States
6 and between Member and non-Member States.
7 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
8 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
9 J. Enforcement
10 1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may initiate
11 legal action against a Member State in default in the United States
12 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where
13 the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
14 provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought
15 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
16 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs
17 of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies
18 herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The
19 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal law or
20 the defaulting Member State's law.
21 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Commission
22 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
23 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
24 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
25 Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.
26 In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
27 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
28 attorney's fees.
29 3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce this Compact
30 against the Commission.
31 SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
-21-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the
2 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
3 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact indicated above,
4 the Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the
5 Charter Member States to determine if the statute enacted by each such
6 Charter Member State is materially different than the model Compact
7 statute.
8 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially
9 different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default
10 process set forth in Section 10.
11 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default or is
12 terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in
13 existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
14 Member States should be less than seven.
15 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter
16 Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection
17 7.C.22 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the
18 model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the
19 Compact.
20 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
21 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to
22 the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence
23 shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically
24 repudiated by the Commission.
25 a. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's
26 initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules
27 and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in
28 that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission
29 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact
30 becomes law in that State.
31 b. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a
-22-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 statute repealing the same.
2 B. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until one
3 hundred eighty days after enactment of the repealing statute.
4 C. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
5 withdrawing State's Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative
6 and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the
7 effective date of withdrawal.
8 D. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a
9 State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all
10 Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
11 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to
12 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of
13 six months after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
14 1. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
15 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
16 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not
17 conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
18 2. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to
19 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State
20 until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.
21 SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
22 A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be
23 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, implementation, and
24 administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
25 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed
26 to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
27 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
28 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court
29 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
30 Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the
31 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
-23-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
2 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and
3 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or
4 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
5 C. Notwithstanding subsection 12.B, the Commission may deny a
6 State's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
7 requirements of subsection 10.B, terminate a Member State's participation
8 in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a
9 Member State is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this
10 Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
11 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the
12 remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member
13 State affected as to all severable matters.
14 SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
15 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any
16 other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
17 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
18 Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of
19 the conflict.
20 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member
21 States are binding in accordance with their terms.
22 Sec. 2. Section 38-3113, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
23 2024, is amended to read:
24 38-3113 Nothing in the Psychology Practice Act shall be construed to
25 prevent:
26 (1) The teaching of psychology, the conduct of psychological
27 research, or the provision of psychological services or consultation to
28 organizations or institutions if such teaching, research, or service does
29 not involve the delivery or supervision of direct psychological services
30 to individuals or groups of individuals who are themselves, rather than a
31 third party, the intended beneficiaries of such services, without regard
-24-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 to the source or extent of payment for services rendered. Nothing in the
2 act shall prevent the provision of expert testimony by psychologists who
3 are otherwise exempted by the act. Persons holding a doctoral degree in
4 psychology from an institution of higher education may use the title
5 psychologist in conjunction with the activities permitted by this
6 subdivision;
7 (2) Members of other recognized professions that are licensed,
8 certified, or regulated under the laws of this state from rendering
9 services consistent with their professional training and code of ethics
10 and within the scope of practice as set out in the statutes regulating
11 their professional practice if they do not represent themselves to be
12 psychologists;
13 (3) Duly recognized members of the clergy from functioning in their
14 ministerial capacity if they do not represent themselves to be
15 psychologists or their services as psychological;
16 (4) Persons who are certified as school psychologists by the State
17 Board of Education or who hold an Equivalent License under the School
18 Psychologist Interstate Licensure Compact from using the title school
19 psychologist and practicing psychology as defined in the Psychology
20 Practice Act if (a) such practice is restricted to regular employment
21 within a setting under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education.
22 Such individuals shall be employees of the educational setting and not
23 independent contractors providing psychological services to educational
24 settings, or (b) employed through a service agency with special education
25 programs and rates approved by the State Department of Education; or
26 (5) Any of the following persons from engaging in activities defined
27 as the practice of psychology if they do not represent themselves by the
28 title psychologist, if they do not use terms other than psychological
29 trainee, psychological intern, psychological resident, or psychological
30 assistant to refer to themselves, and if they perform their activities
31 under the supervision and responsibility of a psychologist in accordance
-25-

LB84 LB84
2025 2025
1 with the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under the
2 Psychology Practice Act:
3 (a) A matriculated graduate student in psychology whose activities
4 constitute a part of the course of study for a graduate degree in
5 psychology at an institution of higher education;
6 (b) An individual pursuing postdoctoral training or experience in
7 psychology, including persons seeking to fulfill the requirements for
8 licensure under the act; or
9 (c) An individual with a master's degree in clinical, counseling, or
10 educational psychology or an educational specialist degree in school
11 psychology who administers and scores and may develop interpretations of
12 psychological testing under the supervision of a psychologist. Such
13 individuals shall be deemed to be conducting their duties as an extension
14 of the legal and professional authority of the supervising psychologist
15 and shall not independently provide interpretive information or treatment
16 recommendations to clients or other health care professionals prior to
17 obtaining appropriate supervision. The department, with the
18 recommendation of the board, may adopt and promulgate rules and
19 regulations governing the conduct and supervision of persons referred to
20 in this subdivision, including the number of such persons that may be
21 supervised by a licensed psychologist. Persons who have carried out the
22 duties described in this subdivision as part of their employment in
23 institutions accredited by the Department of Health and Human Services,
24 the State Department of Education, or the Department of Correctional
25 Services for a period of two years prior to September 1, 1994, may use
26 the title psychologist associate in the context of their employment in
27 such settings. Use of the title shall be restricted to duties described
28 in this subdivision, and the title shall be used in its entirety. Partial
29 or abbreviated use of the title and use of the title beyond what is
30 specifically authorized in this subdivision shall constitute the
31 unlicensed practice of psychology.
