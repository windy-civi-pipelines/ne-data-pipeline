30 care provider in accordance with the following timeframes:
31 (a) For a prior authorization request for urgent health care

8 prior authorization application programming interface or other electronic
9 prior authorization methodology described in subsection (2) of section 6
10 of this act or as part of a risk-sharing agreement.

30 condition, or restrict an approved prior authorization if care is
31 provided within sixty days from the date the health care provider
-8-

LB77 LB77
2025 2025
1 received the prior authorization approval unless the enrollee was no
2 longer eligible for care on the day care was provided.
3 (2) A health carrier shall pay a contracted health care provider at
4 the contracted payment rate for a health care service provided by the
5 health care provider per an approved prior authorization request, unless:

8 determination on the prior authorization request.
9 (d) Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit a
10 health care provider or enrollee from appealing an adverse determination
11 as allowed under state law. If an adverse determination is overturned on
12 appeal, and no other legal action related to the claim is pending, then
13 the health carrier shall reimburse the health care provider at the
14 contracted rate for inpatient care provided to the enrollee.
15 (3) This section does not require a health benefit plan to cover

25 a new health benefit plan. During such time period, a utilization review
26 agent may perform its own review to grant a prior authorization.
27 (2) If there is a change in coverage of, or approval criteria for, a
28 previously authorized health care service, the change in coverage or
29 approval criteria does not affect a prior authorization request approved
30 before the effective date of the change.
31 (3) A utilization review agent shall continue to honor a prior
-10-

LB77 LB77
2025 2025
1 authorization it has granted to an enrollee when the enrollee changes
2 health insurance products under the same health insurance company without
3 any action required by the health care provider.
4 Sec. 12. (1) An artificial intelligence-based algorithm shall not

13 agent's automated utilization management system. The department may
14 contract with a third-party entity to perform an audit pursuant to this
15 section.
16 Sec. 13. A utilization review agent shall not:
17 (1) Be compensated based on its volume of denials; or
