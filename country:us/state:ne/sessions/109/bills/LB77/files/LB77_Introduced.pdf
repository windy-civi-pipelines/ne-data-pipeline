14 the patient, the utilization review entity shall include in the notice of
15 adverse determination the name and telephone number of a physician acting

15 only the approved uniform prior authorization request forms and all
16 health benefit plans and utilization review entities shall accept and
17 process prior authorization requests submitted using such forms.
18 (3) This section does not prohibit a health carrier from using a

-9-

LB77 LB77
2025 2025
1 (2) A health benefit plan shall pay a contracted health care
2 provider at the contracted payment rate for a health care service
3 provided by the health care provider per a prior authorization, unless:
4 (a) The health care provider knowingly and materially misrepresented
5 the health care service in the prior authorization request with the
6 specific intent to deceive and obtain an unlawful payment under the
7 health benefit plan;
8 (b) The health care service was no longer a covered benefit on the
9 day it was provided;

12 (d) The health care provider failed to meet the utilization review
13 entity's timely filing requirements; or
14 (e) The patient was no longer eligible for health care coverage on
15 the day the care was provided.
16 Sec. 10. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, prior
17 authorization shall be valid for at least one year from the date the
18 health care provider receives the prior authorization, and the
19 authorization period shall be effective regardless of any changes in
20 dosage for a prescription drug prescribed by the health care provider.
21 (2) If a prior authorization is required for a health care service,
22 other than for inpatient acute care, for the treatment of a chronic
23 condition of an enrollee, the prior authorization shall remain valid for
24 the length of the treatment.
25 (3) If a prior authorization is required for inpatient acute care
26 for the treatment of a chronic condition of an enrollee, the prior
27 authorization shall remain valid for at least fourteen calendar days from

-10-

LB77 LB77
2025 2025
1 requests for the continuation of inpatient acute care according to the
2 provisions of the Ensuring Transparency in Prior Authorization Act. A
3 utilization review entity shall not use any stricter criteria to
4 determine medical necessity and appropriateness of the continuation of
5 inpatient acute care than the criteria used to evaluate the initial
6 request for authorization of inpatient acute care. A utilization review
7 entity shall review any relevant and pertinent literature or data
8 provided by the health care provider to determine the medical necessity
9 and appropriateness of the requested length of stay or continuation of
10 inpatient acute care. A prior authorization for the continuation of
11 inpatient acute care shall remain valid for a maximum of fourteen
12 calendar days from the date the health care provider receives the prior
13 authorization approval. If a utilization review entity fails to respond
14 to a health care provider's timely prior authorization request for the
15 continuation of inpatient acute care before the termination of the
16 previously approved length of stay, then the health benefit plan shall
17 continue to compensate the health care provider at the contracted rate
18 for inpatient acute care provided until the utilization review entity
19 issues its determination on the prior authorization request. For purposes
20 of this section, a timely prior authorization request for the
21 continuation of inpatient acute care means a request that is submitted at
22 least seventy-two hours prior to the termination of the previously
23 approved prior authorization and includes all necessary information for
24 the utilization review entity to make a determination. If a utilization
25 review entity issues an adverse determination to a health care provider's
26 prior authorization request for continuation of inpatient acute care and
27 the health care provider appeals the adverse determination according to
28 the provisions of the Ensuring Transparency in Prior Authorization Act,
29 then the health benefit plan shall continue to compensate the health care
30 provider at the contracted rate for inpatient acute care provided until
31 the appeal has been finalized.

1 (4) This section does not require a health benefit plan to cover
2 care, treatment, or services for a health condition that the terms of
3 coverage otherwise completely exclude from the policy's covered benefits
4 without regard for whether the care, treatment, or services are medically
5 necessary.
6 Sec. 11. (1) On receipt of information documenting a prior
7 authorization from the enrollee or from the enrollee's health care
8 provider, a utilization review entity shall honor a prior authorization
9 granted to an enrollee from a previous utilization review entity for at
10 least the initial sixty days of an enrollee's coverage under a new health
11 benefit plan. During such time period, a utilization review entity may
12 perform its own review to grant a prior authorization.
13 (2) If there is a change in coverage of, or approval criteria for, a
14 previously authorized health care service, the change in coverage or
15 approval criteria does not affect an enrollee who received prior
16 authorization before the effective date of the change for the remainder
17 of the enrollee's plan year.
18 (3) A utilization review entity shall continue to honor a prior
19 authorization it has granted to an enrollee when the enrollee changes
20 products under the same health insurance company without any act on
21 behalf of the health care provider.
22 Sec. 12. (1) An artificial intelligence-based algorithm shall not
23 be the sole basis of a utilization review entity's decision to deny,
24 delay, or modify health care services based, in whole or in part, on
25 medical necessity.
26 (2) A utilization review entity shall disclose to the department, to
27 each health care provider in its network, to each enrollee, and on its
28 public website if artificial intelligence-based algorithms are used or
29 will be used in the utilization review process.
30 (3) The department may, at any time, audit a utilization review
31 entity's automated utilization management system. The department may

2 section.
3 Sec. 13. A utilization review entity shall not:

28 declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect
29 the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.
