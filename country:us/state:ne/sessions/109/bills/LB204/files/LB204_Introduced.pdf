1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 19 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Biometric Autonomy Liberty Law.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds that:
4 (1) The use of biometric data is growing in commercial, therapeutic,
5 and recreational applications;
6 (2) The use of biometric data to identify or monitor individuals is
7 unlike other unique identifiers that are used in commercial and
8 recreational applications. Biometric data of an individual that has been
9 compromised leaves the individual with no recourse, a heightened risk for
10 identity theft, and a greater likelihood to withdraw from transactions
11 facilitated by biometric data;
12 (3) An overwhelming majority of members of the public are weary of
13 the use of biometric data when such data is tied to finances and other
14 personal information;
15 (4) The ramifications of biometric data technology are not fully
16 known; and
17 (5) The public's welfare, security, and safety will be served by
18 regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, handling, storage,
19 retention, and destruction of biometric data.
20 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Biometric Autonomy Liberty Law:
21 (1)(a) Biometric data means data that is generated to identify a
22 specific individual through an automatic measurement of a biological
23 characteristic of such individual and includes any:
24 (i) Fingerprint;
25 (ii) Voice print;
26 (iii) Retina image;
27 (iv) Iris image; or
28 (v) Unique biological pattern or characteristic.
29 (b) Biometric data does not include:
30 (i) Any photograph, video recording, or audio recording, except for
31 data generated or collected from the biological characteristics of a
-2-

2025 2025
1 person depicted in any such photograph, video recording, or audio
2 recording; or
3 (ii) Information collected, used, or stored for health care
4 treatment, payment, or operations under the Health Insurance Portability
5 and Accountability Act;
6 (2) Collect means to gather, acquire, or obtain;

10 data, unique identifier number used to locate any account or property,
11 account number, personal identification number, pass code, motor vehicle
12 operator's license number, state identification card number, or social
13 security number;
14 (4) Controller means any private entity or public entity that, alone
15 or jointly with others, determines the purpose and means of processing
16 biometric data;
17 (5) Disclose includes redisclosure and dissemination;
18 (6) Implantable device means a biocompatible device that can be
19 implanted inside the body;
20 (7) Portable means the ability of an individual to transfer
21 biometric data in a usable form from one controller or processor to
22 another controller or processor;
23 (8) Possess means to have any custody of, to have any control of, to
24 manage the storage of, or to use;
25 (9)(a) Private entity means any individual, partnership,
26 corporation, limited liability company, association, or other group or
27 entity, however organized.
28 (b) Private entity does not include a public entity;
29 (10) Process or processing means an operation or set of operations
30 performed, whether by manual or automated means, on biometric data or on
31 sets of biometric data, such as the collection, use, storage, disclosure,
-3-

2025 2025
1 analysis, deletion, or modification of biometric data;
2 (11) Processor means any private entity or public entity that
3 processes biometric data on behalf of a controller;
4 (12) Public entity means:

LB204 LB204
2025 2025
1 available to the public a written policy establishing a retention
2 schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric data at the
3 earliest occurrence of the following:
4 (a) Unless the individual has provided written consent to a longer
5 term, the initial purpose for collecting or possessing such data has been

12 (2) Except if necessary to comply with a warrant or subpoena issued
13 by a court of competent jurisdiction, a controller or processor that is a

16 controller or processor.
17 Sec. 10. (1) Except as provided in section 18 of this act, a

7 any individual who does not consent to the collection or possession of
8 biometric data.
9 (2) A private entity or public entity may provide a difference in
10 any service, good, benefit, or reward provided to any individual who does
11 not consent to the collection or possession of biometric data if such
12 collection or possession is necessary to the provision of the service,
13 good, benefit, or reward such that its absence would render the service,
14 good, benefit, or reward inoperable, meaningless, or irrelevant.
15 Sec. 12. (1) A private entity or public entity in possession of or
16 with access to biometric data shall not sell, lease, trade, or use
17 biometric data without the prior written consent of the individual from
18 whom the data was originally collected.

LB204 LB204
2025 2025

12 store, transmit, and protect from disclosure all of such data:
13 (1) Using the reasonable standard of care within the industry or
14 profession of the processor; and
15 (2) In a manner that:
16 (a) Is the same as or more protective than the manner in which the
17 processor stores, transmits, and protects other confidential and
18 sensitive data; or

1 (3) Before bringing an action under this section, the Attorney
2 General or an individual shall provide written notice to the party
3 alleged to have violated the Biometric Autonomy Liberty Law. Such party
4 shall have sixty days from the date of receiving such notice to cure the
5 alleged violation. If the alleged violation is cured within the sixty-day
6 period, no action shall be maintained against such party for the alleged
7 violation.
8 (4) For purposes of a civil action under this section, the following

13 otherwise obtaining the same biometric data from the same person using
14 the same method of collection; and
15 (b) Disclosing the same type of biometric data obtained from the
16 same person to the same recipient using the same method of collection.
17 Sec. 16. A waiver of any provision of the Biometric Autonomy
18 Liberty Law obtained without the written consent of the individual
19 waiving such provision or such individual's legal guardian or legally
20 authorized representative is contrary to public policy and is void and
21 unenforceable.
22 Sec. 17. Nothing in the Biometric Autonomy Liberty Law shall be
23 construed to:
24 (1) Impact the admission or discovery of biometric data in any legal
25 action of any kind in any court or before any private entity or public
