1 Section 1. Section 74-1335, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 74-1335 (1) For purposes of this section, successor in interest
4 includes any agent, successor, assignee, trustee, receiver, or other
5 person acquiring interests or rights in railroad land, including the
6 owner or holder of any servient estate or right of reversion relating to
7 railroad land.
8 (2) Whenever any person owns land on both sides of the right-of-way
9 of any railroad or its successor in interest, such railroad or its
10 successor in interest shall provide and keep in repair at least one
11 adequate means for such landowner to cross the right-of-way. Any
12 interested landowner with land on both sides of the right-of-way of any
13 railroad or its successor in interest may file written complaint with the
14 Department of Transportation against any such railroad or its successor
15 in interest that the crossing is not adequate or is unsafe and dangerous
16 to the life and property of those who use it, and the department
17 thereupon shall make such investigation, hold such hearing, and issue
18 such orders as it deems necessary, proper, and adequate. If circumstances
19 warrant, the department may require overhead, underground, or grade
20 crossings and wing fences at underground crossings or may require
21 existing crossings to be relocated so as to be safe to those who use
22 them, but when a special crossing involves an expenditure of more than
23 one thousand five hundred dollars, the landowner shall bear one-half the
24 expenses in excess of one thousand five hundred dollars.
25 Sec. 2. Original section 74-1335, Reissue Revised Statutes of
26 Nebraska, is repealed.
