Section 1:
LR255 LR255
2025 2025
ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 255
Sorrentino, 39.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the fiscal, constitutional, and administrative implications of adopting
Legislative Resolution 12CA, One Hundred Ninth Legislature, First Session,
2025, as amended by proposed amendment AM1101, which proposes significant
reforms to Nebraska's property tax system and underlying constitutional
language. The study shall include, but need not be limited to, an examination
of the following:
(1) The fiscal and distributional impacts of capping the annual increase
in property taxes levied on any parcel of real property by the allowable growth
percentage, defined as the lesser of three percent or the Consumer Price Index
for All Urban Consumers;
(2) The legal and constitutional implications of substituting the current
uniform and proportional clause of Article VIII, section 1, of the Constitution
of Nebraska, with a system that establishes full taxable value based on the
2025 assessed value or purchase price following a change of ownership;
(3) The practical challenges and administrative viability of implementing
a static assessed value system for real property, including mechanisms for
adjustment upon sale or new construction;
(4) The impact of such a system on taxpayer equity, particularly among
similarly situated properties with different ownership timelines, and the
resultant tax disparities;
(5) The implications of the proposed valuation structure on revenue
predictability and budgeting processes for schools, counties, municipalities,
and other local political subdivisions;
(6) The definition clarity and scope of terms, including, but not limited

to, "purchase", "change of ownership", and "new construction", and the
exemption for spousal transfers;
(7) The comparative evaluation of similar models in other states, such as
California's Proposition 13, Florida's Save Our Homes amendment, and Oklahoma's
property tax limitations, and the lessons they may offer for Nebraska;
(8) The potential impact on housing affordability and accessibility for
young people, first-time homebuyers, fixed-income homeowners, and individuals
attempting to enter the housing market during a period of high home prices and
limited supply;
(9) The effects on agricultural producers and rural landowners,
particularly regarding the classification, valuation, and long-term tax
obligations for farmland and horticultural property; and
(10) Stakeholder concerns and input from assessors, local governments,
school districts, taxpayer advocacy organizations, and the Department of
Revenue regarding feasibility and unintended consequences.
In conducting this interim study, the Revenue Committee may consult with
legal experts, tax policy professionals, economists, state agencies, and
relevant stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed
reforms.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Revenue Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
