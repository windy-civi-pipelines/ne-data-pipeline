8 specific facts shown by affidavit that immediate and irreparable injury,
9 loss, or damage will result to the applicant before the adverse party or
10 his or her attorney can be heard in opposition and (b) the applicant or
11 his or her attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if
12 any, which have been made to give such notice and the reasons supporting

16 a specified time or place before the district court or any judge thereof
17 to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued.

14 restraining order should be granted and, if so, in what amount the bond
15 or undertaking is to be fixed.
16 (6) Any person, natural or artificial, injured or likely to be
17 injured by the granting of a restraining order may intervene in the
18 action at any stage of the proceedings and become a party to the

17 shall be made on a year-to-year basis, not to exceed ten years, and such

19 five consecutive years of nonuse on such land subsequent to when that
20 land was last under such program.
21 (3) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist
22 indefinitely if such nonuse was the result of one or more of the
23 following:
24 (a) For any tract of land under separate ownership, the available
25 supply was used but on only part of the land under the appropriation
26 because of an inadequate water supply;
27 (b) The appropriation is a storage appropriation and there was an
28 inadequate water supply to provide the water for the storage
29 appropriation or less than the full amount of the storage appropriation
30 was needed to keep the reservoir full; or
31 (c) The appropriation is a storage-use appropriation and there was
-27-

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 an inadequate water supply to provide the water for the appropriation or
2 use of the storage water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions.
3 (4) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
4 fifteen consecutive years if such nonuse was a result of one or more of
5 the following:
6 (a) Federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations temporarily
7 prevented or restricted such use;
8 (b) Use of the water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions;
9 (c) Circumstances were such that a prudent person, following the
10 principles of good husbandry, would not have been expected to use the
11 water;
12 (d) The works, diversions, or other facilities essential to use the
13 water were destroyed by a cause not within the control of the owner of
14 the appropriation and good faith efforts to repair or replace the works,
15 diversions, or facilities have been and are being made;
16 (e) The owner of the appropriation was in active involuntary service
17 in the armed forces of the United States or was in active voluntary
18 service during a time of crisis; or
19 (f) Legal proceedings prevented or restricted use of the water.
20 The Chief Water Officer department may specify by rule and
21 regulation other circumstances that shall be deemed to constitute
22 sufficient cause for nonuse for up to fifteen years.
23 (5) When an appropriation is held in the name of an irrigation
24 district, a reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district,
25 a mutual irrigation company or canal company, or the United States Bureau
26 of Reclamation and the Chief Water Officer director determines that water
27 under that appropriation has not been used on a specific parcel of land
28 for more than five years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse
29 exists, the right to use water under that appropriation on that parcel
30 shall be terminated and notice of the termination shall be posted on the
31 department's website and shall be given in the manner provided in

1 subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The district or company
2 holding such right shall have five years after the determination, or five
3 years after an order of cancellation issued by the Chief Water Officer
4 department following the filing of a voluntary relinquishment of the
5 water appropriation that has been signed by the landowner and the
6 appropriator of record, to assign the right to use that portion of the
7 appropriation to other land within the district or the area served by the
8 company, to file an application for a transfer in accordance with section
9 46-290, or to transfer the right in accordance with sections 46-2,127 to
10 46-2,129. The Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its order of
11 cancellation within sixty days after receipt of the voluntary
12 relinquishment unless the relinquishment is conditioned by the landowner
13 upon an action of a governmental agency. If the relinquishment contains
14 such a provision, the Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its
15 order of cancellation within sixty days after receipt of notification
16 that such action has been completed. The Chief Water Officer department
17 shall be notified of any such assignment within thirty days after such
18 assignment. If the district or company does not assign the right to use
19 that portion of the appropriation to other land, does not file an
20 application for a transfer within the five-year period, or does not
21 notify the Chief Water Officer department within thirty days after any
22 such assignment, that portion of the appropriation shall be canceled
23 without further proceedings by the Chief Water Officer department and the
24 district or company involved shall be so notified by the Chief Water
25 Officer department. During the time within which assignment of a portion
26 of an appropriation is pending, the allowable diversion rate for the
27 appropriation involved shall be reduced, as necessary, to avoid
28 inconsistency with the rate allowed by section 46-231 or with any greater
29 rate previously approved for such appropriation by the Chief Water
30 Officer director in accordance with section 46-229.06.
31 (6) When it is determined by the Chief Water Officer director that
-29-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 an appropriation, for which the location of use has been temporarily
2 transferred in accordance with sections 46-290 to 46-294, has not been
3 used at the new location for more than five years and that no sufficient
4 cause for such nonuse exists, the right to use that appropriation at the
5 temporary location of use shall be terminated. Notice of that termination
6 shall be posted on the department's website and shall be given in the
7 manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The
8 right to reinitiate use of that appropriation at the location of use
9 prior to the temporary transfer shall continue to exist for five years
10 after the Chief Water Officer's director's determination, but if such use
11 is not reinitiated at that location within such five-year period, the
12 appropriation shall be subject to cancellation in accordance with
13 sections 46-229 to 46-229.04.
14 (7) If at the time of a hearing conducted in accordance with
15 subsection (1) of this section there is an application for incidental or
16 intentional underground water storage pending before the Chief Water
17 Officer department and filed by the owner of the appropriation, the
18 proceedings shall be consolidated.
19 Sec. 81. Section 46-229.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:
21 46-229.05 An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Chief
22 Water Officer department upon such hearing as provided by section 61-207.
23 Sec. 82. Section 46-229.06, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-229.06 When a departmental proceeding that is conducted pursuant
26 to sections 46-229 to 46-229.04 concerns the partial cancellation of an
27 appropriation, the Chief Water Officer department may receive evidence on
28 the question of whether, following such partial cancellation, a reduction
29 in the rate of diversion to the maximum rate prescribed in section 46-231
30 would result in an authorized diversion rate less than the rate
31 necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of
-30-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 crops on the lands that remain subject to the appropriation. If the Chief
2 Water Officer director determines, based on a preponderance of the
3 evidence, that such rate would be less than the rate necessary, in the
4 interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops, he or she may
5 approve a diversion rate for the remaining portion of the appropriation
6 greater than the maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such
7 increased rate can be no greater than the rate authorized for the
8 appropriation prior to the partial cancellation and no greater than the
9 rate determined by the Chief Water Officer director to be necessary, in
10 the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands
11 that remain subject to the appropriation.
12 Sec. 83. Section 46-230, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
13 amended to read:
14 46-230 (1) As the adjudication of a stream progresses and as each
15 claim is finally adjudicated, the Chief Water Officer director shall make
16 and cause to be entered of record in his or her office an order
17 determining and establishing the priorities of right to use the water of
18 such stream, the amount of the appropriation of the persons claiming
19 water from such stream and the character of use for which each
20 appropriation is found to have been made, and the address of the owner of
21 each water appropriation.
22 (2) Whenever requested by the Chief Water Officer department, the
23 owner of any appropriation not held by an irrigation district,
24 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
25 irrigation or canal company shall provide the Chief Water Officer
26 department with the name, address, and telephone number of each then-
27 current owner of the appropriation and with the name, address, and
28 telephone number of any tenant or other person who is authorized by the
29 owner to receive opening and closing notices and other departmental
30 communications relating to the appropriation. Each appropriation owner
31 shall also notify the Chief Water Officer department any time there is a
-31-

LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 change in any of such names, addresses, or telephone numbers. Notice of
2 ownership changes may be provided to the Chief Water Officer department
3 in the manner provided in section 76-2,124 or in any other manner
4 authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. If notice of an
5 ownership change is provided other than in accordance with such section,
6 the notice shall include such evidence of ownership as the Chief Water
7 Officer director may require. Notice of all other changes may be provided
8 in any manner authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. Upon
9 receipt of any new information, the Chief Water Officer department shall
10 update the Chief Water Officer's its records. The Chief Water Officer
11 department shall not collect a fee for the filing of any such information
12 or for updating the Chief Water Officer's its records.
13 Sec. 84. Section 46-231, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-231 Each appropriation shall be determined in its priority and
16 amount by the time at which it is made and the amount of water which the
17 works are constructed to carry. An appropriator shall at no time be
18 entitled to the use of more than he or she can beneficially use for the
19 purposes for which the appropriation has been made, and the amount of any
20 appropriation made by means of enlargement of the distributing works
21 shall be determined in like manner.
22 An allotment from the natural flow of streams for irrigation shall
23 not exceed one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of
24 land and shall not exceed three acre-feet in the aggregate during one
25 calendar year for each acre of land for which such appropriation has been
26 made, and an allotment shall not exceed the least amount of water that
27 experience may indicate is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry,
28 for the production of crops. Such limitations do not apply to storage
29 waters or to water appropriations transferred pursuant to sections
30 46-2,122 to 46-2,125 and 46-2,127 to 46-2,129.
31 When storage water is being used in addition to the natural flow,
-32-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 the person in charge of the ditch or canal shall, upon his or her request
2 and within twenty-four hours thereof, be notified in writing by the user
3 of such storage waters of the time of withdrawal from natural streams to
4 be distributed according to law.
5 When an appropriation is for irrigation purposes and the amount is
6 so small that a proper distribution and application is impractical, as
7 much water as the applicant can use without waste may be allotted for a
8 limited time so fixed by the Chief Water Officer department as to give
9 each appropriator his or her just share without violating other rights,
10 so long as (1) the volume of water used in a twenty-four-hour period does
11 not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been allowed at
12 the approved fixed continuous rate for a twenty-four-hour period or (2)
13 the volume of water used in a seven-day, Monday-through-Sunday period
14 does not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been
15 allowed at the approved fixed continuous rate for a seven-day period. The
16 Chief Water Officer department shall determine schedules among
17 appropriators to assure that other rights are not violated.
18 Sec. 85. Section 46-233, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 46-233 (1) The United States and every person intending to
21 appropriate any of the public waters of the State of Nebraska shall,
22 before (a) commencing the construction, enlargement, or extension of any
23 works for such purpose, (b) performing any work in connection with such
24 construction, enlargement, or extension, or (c) taking any water from any
25 constructed works, make an application to the Chief Water Officer
26 department for a permit to make such appropriation. A permit may be
27 obtained to appropriate public waters for intentional underground water
28 storage and recovery of such water. A public water supplier may make
29 application to appropriate public waters for induced ground water
30 recharge.
31 (2) The application shall be upon a form prescribed and furnished by
-33-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 the Chief Water Officer department without cost to an applicant. Such
2 application shall set forth (a) the name and post office address of the
3 applicant, (b) the source from which such appropriation shall be made,
4 (c) the amount of the appropriation desired, as nearly as it may be
5 estimated, (d) the location of any proposed work in connection with the
6 appropriation, (e) the estimated time required for its completion, which
7 estimated time shall include the period required for the construction of
8 ditches, pumps, and other features or devices, (f) the time estimated at
9 which the application of the water for the beneficial purposes shall be
10 made, which time shall be limited to a reasonable time following the
11 estimated time of completion of the work when prosecuted with diligence,
12 (g) the purpose for which water is to be applied and (i) if for induced
13 ground water recharge by a public water supplier, a statement of the
14 times of the year when and location along a stream where flows for
15 induced ground water recharge are proposed and (ii) if for irrigation, a
16 description of the land to be irrigated by the water and the amount, and
17 (h) such facts and supporting documentation as are required by the Chief
18 Water Officer department which shall include, but not be limited to, the
19 depth of all wells, the extent of the underlying aquifer, the expected
20 rate of recharge, the minimum flow or flows necessary to sustain the well
21 field throughout the reach identified, and the period of time that a well
22 field would continue to meet minimal essential needs of the public water
23 supplier when there is no flow as those factors relate to and are part of
24 an evaluation of pertinent hydrologic relationships.
25 A public water supplier making application for induced ground water
26 recharge may submit with its application a statement of the amount of
27 induced ground water recharge water which the public water supplier
28 presently uses as well as the amount of induced ground water recharge
29 water it anticipates using in the next twenty-five-year period. Such
30 statement shall also quantify the total amount of water the public water
31 supplier presently uses from the well field as well as the total amount
-34-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 of water it anticipates using from the well field in the next twenty-
2 five-year period.
3 (3) Upon receipt of an application containing the information set
4 forth in this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall (a) make
5 a record of the receipt of the application, (b) cause the application to
6 be recorded in its office, and (c) make a careful examination of the
7 application to ascertain whether it sets forth all the facts necessary to
8 enable the Chief Water Officer department to determine the nature and
9 amount of the proposed appropriation. If such an examination shows the
10 application in any way defective, it shall be returned to the applicant
11 for correction, with a statement of the correction required, within
12 ninety days after its receipt. Ninety days shall be allowed for the
13 refiling of the application, and in default of such refiling, the
14 application shall stand dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (4)
15 of this section, if so filed and corrected as required within such time,
16 the application shall, upon being accepted and allowed, take priority as
17 of the date of the original filing, subject to compliance with the future
18 provisions of the law and the rules and regulations thereunder. During
19 the pendency of any application or upon its approval, the Chief Water
20 Officer department, upon proper authorization and request of the
21 applicant, may assign the application a later priority date.
22 (4) For public water supplier wells in existence on September 9,
23 1993, the priority date assigned to an application for induced ground
24 water recharge made by a public water supplier shall be:
25 (a) June 27, 1963, for water supply wells and facilities constructed
26 and placed in service on or before June 27, 1963;
27 (b) January 1, 1970, for water supply wells and facilities
28 constructed and placed in service on or after June 28, 1963, and on or
29 before December 31, 1969;
30 (c) January 1, 1980, for water supply wells and facilities

1 before December 31, 1979;
2 (d) January 1, 1990, for water supply wells and facilities
3 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1980, and on or
4 before December 31, 1989; and
5 (e) January 1, 1993, for water supply wells and facilities
6 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1990, and on or
7 before September 9, 1993.
8 (5) Prior to taking action on an application for induced ground
9 water recharge, the Chief Water Officer director shall publish notice of
10 such application at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
11 three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
12 of the stream segment and also in a newspaper of statewide circulation.
13 The notice shall state that any person having an interest may, in
14 writing, object to the application. Any such objection shall be filed
15 with the Chief Water Officer department within two weeks after the final
16 publication of the notice.
17 (6) After the Chief Water Officer director has accepted the
18 application made under subsection (2) of this section as a completed
19 application and published notice as required under subsection (5) of this
20 section, the Chief Water Officer director shall, if he or she determines
21 that a hearing is necessary, set a time and place for a public hearing on
22 the application. The hearing shall be held within reasonable proximity to
23 the area in which the wells are or would be located. At the hearing the
24 applicant shall present all hydrological data and other evidence
25 supporting its application. All interested parties shall be allowed to
26 testify and present evidence relative to the application.
27 (7) An unapproved application pending on August 26, 1983, may be
28 amended to include appropriation for intentional underground water
29 storage and recovery of such water.
30 (8) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer department
31 for a temporary permit to appropriate water. The same standards for
-36-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 granting a permanent appropriation shall apply for granting such
2 temporary permit except when the temporary permit is for road
3 construction or other public use construction and the amount of water
4 requested is less than ten acre-feet in total volume. For temporary
5 permits for public-use construction, the applicant shall include on the
6 application the location of the diversion, the location of use, a
7 description of the project, the amount of water requested, and the person
8 to contact. Temporary permits for public-use construction and for less
9 than ten acre-feet in total volume may be granted without any
10 determination of unappropriated water and shall be considered to be in
11 the public interest. The requirement of filing a map or plans with the
12 application for a temporary permit may be waived at the discretion of the
13 Chief Water Officer director. In granting a temporary permit, the Chief
14 Water Officer director shall specify a date on which the right to
15 appropriate water under the permit shall expire. Under no circumstances
16 shall such date be longer than one calendar year after the date the
17 temporary permit was granted. Temporary permits shall be administered
18 during times of shortage based on priority. The right to appropriate
19 water shall automatically terminate on the date specified by the Chief
20 Water Officer director on the temporary permit without further action by
21 the Chief Water Officer department.
22 (9) Water may be diverted from any stream, reservoir, or canal by
23 any fire department or emergency response services for the purpose of
24 extinguishing a fire in progress in an emergency without obtaining a
25 permit from the Chief Water Officer department. The installation of a dry
26 well for this purpose is allowed without the prior permission of the
27 Chief Water Officer department, but the Chief Water Officer department
28 shall be informed of any such installation, its location, and the party
29 responsible for its installation and maintenance within thirty days after
30 the installation.

3 department for a permit to appropriate any of the public surface waters
4 of the State of Nebraska to be diverted or stored in Nebraska for use in
5 any other state.
6 (2) In determining whether to grant such application, the Chief
7 Water Officer director shall consider the following factors:
8 (a) Whether unappropriated water exists in the source of supply
9 named in the application;
10 (b) Whether such application and appropriation when perfected are
11 not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
12 (c) Whether denial of the application is demanded by the public
13 interest; and
14 (d) Whether the proposed use is a beneficial use of water.
15 (3) When determining whether denial of such application is demanded
16 by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall consider
17 the following factors:
18 (a) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
19 use;
20 (b) Any adverse economic, environmental, and other impacts of the
21 proposed use;
22 (c) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated

1 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
2 overall benefits to Nebraska are greater than the adverse impacts to
3 Nebraska. The Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying
4 an application shall specify the reasons for such action, including a
5 discussion of the required factors for consideration, and shall document
6 such decision by reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any
7 other sources used by the Chief Water Officer director in making the
8 decision.
9 Sec. 87. Section 46-234, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 46-234 If there is no unappropriated water in the source of supply
12 or if a prior appropriation has been perfected to water the same land to
13 be watered by the applicant, the Chief Water Officer department may
14 refuse such application. An application may also be refused (1) if
15 existing facilities other than those owned or operated by the applicant
16 are to be utilized and the applicant fails to show, by documentary
17 evidence, agreements with the owner and operator of the facilities to
18 allow the applicant to use such facilities or (2) when denial is demanded
19 by the public interest. The party making such application shall not
20 prosecute such work so long as such refusal continues in force. An
21 application for appropriation shall not be exclusive of any of the lands
22 included therein until the owner or owners of such land give consent to
23 the same in proper form duly acknowledged. No application made or canal
24 constructed, prior to the application of the water and the perfection of
25 an appropriation therefor or the filing of the consent, shall prevent
26 other applications from being allowed and other canals from being
27 constructed to irrigate the same lands or any of them. In case of an
28 application for an appropriation of water for the development of water
29 power, the Chief Water Officer department shall promptly act upon such
30 application and limit the time within which such appropriation shall be
31 perfected to the period within which the proposed power project can be

3 amended to read:
4 46-235 (1) For applications other than those to appropriate public
5 waters for induced ground water recharge, if there is unappropriated
6 water in the source of supply named in the application, if such
7 application and appropriation when perfected are not otherwise
8 detrimental to the public welfare, and if denial of the application is
9 not demanded by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer department
10 shall approve the application and shall make a record in its office and
11 return the application to the applicant, who shall on receipt thereof be
12 authorized to proceed with the work and to take such measures as may be
13 necessary to perfect such application into an appropriation. The priority
14 of such application and appropriation when perfected shall date from the
15 filing of the application with in the Chief Water Officer office of the
16 department, and the date of filing shall be regarded as the priority
17 number thereof. The Chief Water Officer department may, upon examination
18 of such application, approve it for a shorter period of time for
19 perfecting the proposed appropriation or for a smaller amount of water or
20 of land than applied for. The Chief Water Officer department may also
21 impose such other reasonable conditions as the Chief Water Officer it
22 deems appropriate to protect the public interest. An applicant aggrieved
23 by the action of the Chief Water Officer department shall, upon proper
24 showing, be granted a hearing before the Chief Water Officer department,
25 which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
26 procedure adopted by the Chief Water Officer department, and a full and

5 the use or uses for which the appropriation has been requested;
6 (ii) The rate and timing of the flow is the amount reasonably
7 necessary to maintain the well or wells for the uses for which the
8 appropriation has been requested; and
9 (iii) The application is in the public interest and is not
10 detrimental to the public welfare. There shall be a rebuttable
11 presumption that wells which are the subject of an application pursuant
12 to subdivision (2)(a) of this section are in the public interest and are
13 not detrimental to the public welfare.
14 (b) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application for
15 a well or wells constructed before September 9, 1993, but may
16 specifically deny the applicant the right to request regulation of junior
17 appropriators if the Chief Water Officer director, at the time of
18 approval, finds that the well or wells, at the time of their
19 construction, were not located, designed, or constructed so as to take
20 reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the area to minimize the
21 frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced ground water
22 recharge. Thereafter a public water supplier holding an approved
23 application which has been denied the right to request regulation of
24 junior appropriators may petition the Chief Water Officer director for a
25 hearing to present evidence showing the Chief Water Officer director that
26 the well or wells have been modified, relocated, or reconstructed to take
27 reasonable advantage of the aquifer conditions in the area. If the Chief
28 Water Officer director determines that the well or wells have been so
29 modified, relocated, or reconstructed, the Chief Water Officer director
30 shall cause to be modified the approval of the application to allow for
31 the regulation of junior appropriators, subject to the restrictions or

1 conditions applicable to public water suppliers.
2 (c) An application for an induced ground water recharge
3 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
4 service before September 9, 1993, shall not be subject to the
5 requirements of sections 46-288 and 46-289.
6 (3) An application for an induced ground water recharge
7 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed or to be
8 constructed on or after September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief
9 Water Officer director if he or she makes the findings required by
10 subdivision (2)(a) of this section and further finds that:
11 (a) There is unappropriated water available for the appropriation;
12 and
13 (b) The well or wells involved have been or will be located and
14 constructed to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the
15 area to minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for
16 induced ground water recharge.
17 (4)(a) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application
18 filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section for a smaller amount of
19 water than requested by the applicant. The Chief Water Officer director
20 may also impose reasonable conditions on the manner and timing of the
21 appropriation which the Chief Water Officer director deems necessary to
22 protect the public interest. The Chief Water Officer director may grant
23 an appropriation for specific months of the year if so demanded by the
24 public interest. If the Chief Water Officer director approves the
25 application, he or she shall issue a written order, which written order
26 shall include the findings required by this section, the amount of the
27 appropriation, and any conditions or limitations imposed under this
28 section.
29 (b) In determining whether an application for an appropriation for
30 induced ground water recharge is in the public interest, the Chief Water
31 Officer's director's considerations shall include, but not be limited to,
-42-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 the possible adverse effects on existing surface water or ground water
2 users and the economic, social, and environmental value of such uses,
3 including, but not limited to, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife,
4 public water supply, induced ground water recharge for public water
5 supply systems, and water quality maintenance.
6 (c) The stream segment and the determination of a reasonable and
7 necessary amount of water required for induced ground water recharge
8 purposes throughout the reach shall be defined specifically by the Chief
9 Water Officer director in the order issued under this section.
10 Sec. 89. Section 46-235.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-235.01 A public water supplier which has received an
13 appropriation for induced ground water recharge pursuant to section
14 46-235 may, from time to time and within twenty-five years after the
15 priority assigned pursuant to section 46-233, petition the Chief Water
16 Officer department for a hearing to present evidence showing that all or
17 part of the original projection for additional water needs specified
18 pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-233 corresponds with the actual
19 use. To the extent the public water supplier is making beneficial use of
20 all or a portion of the water projected in the original application, the
21 right to use such additional water shall vest and the priority date of
22 such anticipated water use shall date back to the priority date assigned
23 pursuant to section 46-233. A public water supplier may not request such
24 a hearing at intervals of less than five years for each approved
25 application.
26 Sec. 90. Section 46-235.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
27 amended to read:
28 46-235.02 (1) Just compensation shall be required if a public water
29 supplier exercises a preference to the injury of a senior appropriator.
30 (2) Just compensation shall be provided by a public water supplier
31 to any injured junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected
-43-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 prior to September 9, 1993, if and to the extent such injury resulted
2 from regulation of junior appropriators requested by the public water
3 supplier to provide water for any purpose other than domestic. Such
4 compensation shall not be required to a junior appropriator if the
5 regulation requested is to provide water for domestic purposes only. At
6 the time any junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected prior
7 to September 9, 1993, is regulated at the request of a public water
8 supplier, the Chief Water Officer department shall determine for each
9 such appropriator the extent to which the regulation is for domestic
10 purposes and the extent to which it is for other purposes.
11 (3) A cause of action for just compensation shall accrue at the time
12 a junior appropriator is regulated by the Chief Water Officer department.
13 Sec. 91. Section 46-235.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-235.03 Natural resources districts shall have the authority to
16 impose restrictions or controls on public water suppliers as specified in
17 the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act. Such
18 restrictions or controls may limit the withdrawal of ground water to a
19 greater degree or extent than is otherwise permitted or allowed by a
20 permit issued by the Chief Water Officer department.
21 Sec. 92. Section 46-235.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-235.04 (1) Induced ground water recharge appropriations shall be
24 administered in the same manner as prescribed by Chapter 46, article 2,
25 for other appropriations. Appropriations for induced ground water
26 recharge may be canceled and annulled as provided in sections 46-229.02
27 to 46-229.05.
28 (2) The Chief Water Officer department may approve the transfer of
29 priority dates among water wells, including replacement water wells,
30 located within a single well field that are subject to an induced
31 recharge appropriation, or are part of an application for such an
-44-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 appropriation, to improve the well field's efficiency of operation with
2 respect to river flow. The transfers shall be approved if the Chief Water
3 Officer department finds that (a) the transfers would not increase the
4 quantity of induced ground water recharge under the original priority
5 date or application, (b) the amount of water withdrawn from water wells
6 under the original priority date or application would not increase, (c)
7 the quantity of streamflow needed to sustain well field operation under
8 the original priority date would decrease, (d) the transfer would not
9 impair the rights of other appropriators, and (e) the transfer is in the
10 public interest in the same manner as provided in section 46-235. The
11 Chief Water Officer department may assign multiple priority dates to a
12 single water well that replaces two or more water wells which are
13 abandoned. Replacement water wells installed pursuant to this subsection
14 must be installed within the same well field as the abandoned water well.
15 Notice shall be furnished and any hearing held as provided in sections
16 46-291 and 46-292. For purposes of this subsection, single well field
17 means those contiguous tracts of land owned or leased by the applicant
18 containing two or more water wells subject to induced recharge.
19 Sec. 93. Section 46-236, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:
21 46-236 An application for appropriation of water for water power
22 shall meet the requirements of section 46-234 and subsection (1) of
23 section 46-235 to be approved. Within six months after the approval of an
24 application for water power and before placing water to any beneficial
25 use, the applicant shall enter into a contract with the State of
26 Nebraska, through the Chief Water Officer department, for leasing the use
27 of all water so appropriated. Such lease shall be upon forms prepared by
28 the Chief Water Officer department, and the time of such lease shall not
29 run for a greater period than fifty years; and for the use of water for
30 power purposes the applicant shall pay into the state treasury on or
31 before January 1 each year fifteen dollars for each one hundred
-45-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 horsepower for all water so appropriated. Upon application of the lessee
2 or its assigns, the Chief Water Officer department shall renew the lease
3 so as to continue it and the water appropriation in full force and effect
4 for an additional period of fifty years.
5 Upon the failure of the applicant to comply with any of the
6 provisions of such lease and the failure to pay any of such fees, the
7 Chief Water Officer department shall notify the lessee that the required
8 fees have not been paid to the Chief Water Officer department or that the
9 lessee is not otherwise in compliance with the provisions of the lease.
10 If the lessee has not come into compliance with all provisions of the
11 lease or has not paid to the Chief Water Officer department all required
12 fees within fifteen calendar days after the date of such notice, the
13 Chief Water Officer department shall issue an order denying the applicant
14 the right to divert or otherwise use the water appropriation for power
15 production. The Chief Water Officer department shall rescind the order
16 denying use of the water appropriation at such time as the lessee has
17 come into compliance with all provisions of the lease and has paid all
18 required fees to the Chief Water Officer department. If after forty-five
19 calendar days from the date of issuance of the order the lessee is not in
20 compliance with all provisions of the lease or required fees have not
21 been paid to the Chief Water Officer department, such lease and water
22 appropriation shall be canceled by the Chief Water Officer department.
23 Sec. 94. Section 46-237, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-237 (1) Within six months after approval and allowance of an
26 application other than an application to appropriate public waters for
27 induced ground water recharge, the applicant shall file with in the Chief
28 Water Officer office of the department a map or plat which shall conform
29 to the rules and regulations of the department as to material, size,
30 coloring, and scale. Such map or plat shall show the source from which
31 the proposed appropriation is to be taken and all proposed dams, dikes,
-46-

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 reservoirs, canals, powerhouses, and other structures for the purpose of
2 storing, conveying, or using water for any purpose whatsoever and their
3 true courses or positions in connection with the boundary lines and
4 corners of lands which they occupy. The lands to be irrigated shall be
5 identified in the manner prescribed by the department. No rights shall be
6 deemed to have been acquired until the provisions of this section have
7 been complied with. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section,
8 failure to so comply shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all
9 rights thereunder.
10 (2) For any appropriation with a priority date earlier than 1958 but
11 for which either the appropriator has failed to comply with the
12 requirements of subsection (1) of this section or a map or plat required
13 by such subsection has been lost or destroyed through no fault of the
14 appropriator, the lack of such compliance or of such map or plat shall
15 not be the basis for an a departmental adjudication or cancellation of
16 the appropriation by the Chief Water Officer and the appropriation shall
17 not be subject to legal challenge by any party on that basis.
18 (3) The Chief Water Officer department may notify any appropriator
19 subject to subsection (2) of this section of the need to file a map or
20 plat of lands under such appropriation. Unless the Chief Water Officer
21 department grants an extension for good cause shown, the appropriator
22 shall file the required map within three years after that notification
23 and such map shall conform to the rules and regulations of the Chief
24 Water Officer department as to material, size, coloring, and scale. If
25 the appropriator fails to comply, the Chief Water Officer department may
26 deny the appropriator the right to divert or withdraw water subject to
27 the appropriation until compliance has been achieved.
28 Sec. 95. Section 46-238, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:

1 the Chief Water Officer department, the person making such application
2 shall commence the excavation or construction of the works in which it is
3 intended to divert the water and the actual construction of any water
4 power plant and reservoir or reservoirs for storage in connection
5 therewith and shall vigorously, diligently, and uninterruptedly prosecute
6 such work to completion unless temporarily interrupted by some
7 unavoidable and natural cause. A failure to comply with this section
8 shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the
9 appropriation. The cost of promotion and engineering work shall not be
10 considered a part of the cost of construction, and the progress of the
11 construction work shall be such that one-tenth of the total work shall be
12 completed within one year from the date of approval of the application.
13 The construction of all work required in connection with the proposed
14 project shall be prosecuted in the manner described in this section and
15 with such a force as shall assure the average rate of constructional
16 progress necessary to complete such work or works within the time
17 stipulated in the approval of such application, notwithstanding the
18 ordinary delays and casualties that must be expected and provided
19 against. A failure to carry on the construction of either an irrigation
20 project or a water power project as outlined in this section shall work a
21 forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the appropriation,
22 and the Chief Water Officer department shall cancel such appropriation.
23 The Chief Water Officer department shall have free access to all records,
24 books, and papers of any irrigation or water power company, shall have
25 the right to go upon the right-of-way and land of any such company, shall
26 inspect the work to see that it is being done according to plans and
27 specifications approved by the Chief Water Officer department, and shall
28 also keep a record of the cost of construction work when deemed advisable
29 for physical valuation purposes.

2 of the other requirements for completing or perfecting an application for
3 flow or storage rights as fixed in the approval of an application or
4 otherwise for the appropriation of water. Such extension may be granted
5 upon a petition to the Chief Water Officer department and the showing of
6 reasonable cause. The Chief Water Officer department shall cause a notice
7 of each petition received to be published at the petitioner's expense in
8 at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties
9 of the appropriation once a week for three consecutive weeks. The Chief
10 Water Officer department shall hold a hearing on the issue of extension
11 on the Chief Water Officer's its own motion or if requested by any
12 interested person. If a hearing is held, notice shall be given by
13 certified mail to the applicant, to any person who requested a hearing,
14 and to any person who requests notification of the hearing. The Chief
15 Water Officer department may grant the extension in the absence of a
16 hearing if no requests for a hearing are received. Any interested person
17 may be made a party to such action. Any party affected by the decision on
18 the petition may appeal directly to the Court of Appeals. Subsequent
19 extensions may be made in the same manner.
20 Sec. 96. Section 46-240.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-240.01 All appropriators of water for agricultural purposes of
23 less than the statutory limit of direct flow from the public waters of
24 this state within the drainage basin of the stream from which such waters
25 originate shall be entitled to such additional appropriation or
26 appropriations from the direct flow of such stream, within the statutory
27 limits provided by law, as may be necessary and required for the
28 production of crops in the practice of good husbandry. Applications for
29 such supplemental additional appropriations from the direct flow, upon
30 the approval or granting thereof, shall have priority within the drainage

2 Sec. 97. Section 46-241, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 46-241 (1) Every person intending to construct and operate a storage
5 reservoir for irrigation or any other beneficial purpose or intending to
6 construct and operate a facility for intentional underground water
7 storage and recovery shall, except as provided in subsections (2) and (3)
8 of this section and section 46-243, make an application to the Chief
9 Water Officer department upon the prescribed form and provide such plans,
10 drawings, and specifications as are necessary to comply with the Safety
11 of Dams and Reservoirs Act. Such application shall be filed and
12 proceedings had thereunder in the same manner and under the same rules
13 and regulations as other applications. Upon the approval of such
14 application under this section and any approval required by the act, the
15 applicant shall have the right to construct and impound in such
16 reservoir, or store in and recover from such underground water storage
17 facility, all water not otherwise appropriated and any appropriated water
18 not needed for immediate use, to construct and operate necessary ditches
19 for the purpose of conducting water to such storage reservoir or
20 facility, and to condemn land for such reservoir, ditches, or other
21 facility. The procedure to condemn property shall be exercised in the
22 manner set forth in sections 76-704 to 76-724.
23 (2) Any person intending to construct an on-channel reservoir with a
24 water storage impounding capacity of less than fifteen acre-feet measured
25 below the crest of the lowest open outlet or overflow shall be exempt
26 from subsection (1) of this section as long as there will be (a) no
27 diversion or withdrawal of water from the reservoir for any purpose other
28 than for watering range livestock and (b) no release from the reservoir
29 to provide water for a downstream diversion or withdrawal for any purpose
30 other than for watering range livestock. This subsection does not exempt

2 (3) Any person intending to construct a reservoir, holding pond, or
3 lagoon for the sole purpose of holding, managing, or disposing of animal
4 or human waste shall be exempt from subsection (1) of this section. This
5 subsection does not exempt any person from any requirements of the Safety
6 of Dams and Reservoirs Act or section 46-233 or 54-2425.
7 (4) Every person intending to modify or rehabilitate an existing
8 storage reservoir so that its impounding capacity is to be increased
9 shall comply with subsection (1) of this section.
10 (5) The owner of a storage reservoir or facility shall be liable for
11 all damages arising from leakage or overflow of the water therefrom or
12 from the breaking of the embankment of such reservoir. The owner or
13 possessor of a reservoir or intentional underground water storage
14 facility does not have the right to store water in such reservoir or
15 facility during the time that such water is required downstream in
16 ditches for direct irrigation or for any reservoir or facility holding a
17 senior right. Every person who owns, controls, or operates a reservoir or
18 intentional underground water storage facility, except political
19 subdivisions of this state, shall be required to pass through the outlets
20 of such reservoir or facility, whether presently existing or hereafter
21 constructed, a portion of the measured inflows to furnish water for
22 livestock in such amounts and at such times as directed by the Chief
23 Water Officer department to meet the requirements for such purposes as
24 determined by the Chief Water Officer department, except that a reservoir
25 or facility owner shall not be required to release water for this purpose
26 which has been legally stored. Any dam shall be constructed in accordance
27 with the Safety of Dams and Reservoirs Act, and the outlet works shall be
28 installed so that water may be released in compliance with this section.
29 The requirement for outlet works may be waived by the Chief Water Officer
30 department upon a showing of good cause. Whenever any person diverts
31 water from a public stream and returns it into the same stream, he or she

1 may take out the same amount of water, less a reasonable deduction for
2 losses in transit, to be determined by the Chief Water Officer
3 department, if no prior appropriator for beneficial use is prejudiced by
4 such diversion.
5 (6) An application for storage and recovery of water intentionally
6 stored underground may be made only by an appropriator of record who
7 shows, by documentary evidence, sufficient interest in the underground
8 water storage facility to entitle the applicant to the water requested.
9 Sec. 98. Section 46-242, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 46-242 (1) After the completion to the satisfaction of the Chief
12 Water Officer department of a storage reservoir for which a permit has
13 been obtained pursuant to section 46-241, any person proposing to apply
14 to beneficial use the water stored shall file with the Chief Water
15 Officer department an application for a permit particularly describing
16 the use to which the water is to be applied and, if for irrigation,
17 describing the land to be irrigated.
18 (2) Application may be made for a permit to appropriate water for
19 the irrigation of land lying both upstream and downstream from a storage
20 reservoir or intentional underground water storage facility. Under an
21 approved application for a permit to appropriate water stored in a
22 reservoir or facility for use on land upstream from such reservoir or
23 facility, water may be diverted from the stream by the applicant and a
24 compensating amount of water shall be released from the reservoir or
25 facility for the use of downstream appropriators, but the rights of prior
26 appropriators shall not be adversely affected by such exchange of water.
27 (3) The owner of a storage reservoir shall have a preferred right to
28 make such application for a period of six months from the time limited
29 for the completion of such reservoir. The date of the expiration of such
30 period shall be endorsed upon the application when allowed. If an

2 Officer department until the applicant shows, by documentary evidence,
3 sufficient interest in such storage reservoir to entitle the applicant to
4 enough water for the purpose set forth in the application.
5 (4) Application may be made for a permit to appropriate water from a
6 storage reservoir, subject to subsection (3) of this section, or an
7 intentional underground water storage facility, subject to subsection (6)
8 of section 46-241, for instream use of water for recreation or fish and
9 wildlife if the appropriation will not prejudice the rights of any prior
10 appropriator for a beneficial use.
11 (5) An unapproved application for a permit pursuant to this section
12 which is pending on August 26, 1983, may be amended to include use of

19 change the point at which the water under any water appropriation of
20 record is diverted from a natural stream or reservoir, change the line of
21 any flume, ditch, or aqueduct, or change a storage site. No reclamation
22 district or power appropriator may change the established return flow
23 point without the approval of the Chief Water Officer department.
24 Sec. 100. Section 46-252, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 46-252 (1) Any person may conduct, either from outside the state or
27 from sources located in the state, quantities of water over and above
28 those already present into or along any of the natural streams or
29 channels of this state, for purposes of instream beneficial uses or
30 withdrawal of some or all of such water for out-of-stream beneficial
31 uses, at any point without regard to any prior appropriation of water

1 from such stream, due allowance being made for losses in transit to be
2 determined by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources.
3 The Chief Water Officer department shall monitor movement of the water by
4 measurements or other means and shall be responsible for assuring that
5 such quantities are not subsequently diverted or withdrawn by others
6 unless they are authorized to do so by the person conducting the water.
7 (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section,
8 before any person may conduct water into or along any of the natural
9 streams or channels of the state, he or she shall first obtain a permit
10 from the Chief Water Officer department. Application for the permit shall
11 be made on forms provided by the Chief Water Officer department.
12 Applications shall include plans and specifications detailing the
13 intended times, amounts, and streamreach locations and such other
14 information as required by the Chief Water Officer department. The water
15 subject to such a permit shall be deemed appropriated for the use
16 specified in the permit. Permitholders shall be liable for any damages
17 resulting from the overflow of such stream or channel when water so
18 conducted contributed to such overflow.
19 (3) Any person actually engaged in the construction or operation of

26 46-289 The Legislature finds, recognizes, and declares that the
27 transfer of water to outside the boundaries of a river basin may have
28 impacts on the water and other resources in the basin and that such
29 impacts differ from those caused by uses of water within the same basin
30 in part because any unused water will not be returned to the stream from
31 which it is taken for further use in that river basin. The Legislature

1 therefor recognizes the need to delineate factors for consideration by
2 the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
3 Environment Director of Natural Resources when evaluating an application
4 made pursuant to section 46-233 which involves an interbasin transfer of
5 water in order to determine whether denial of such application is
6 demanded by the public interest. Those considerations shall include, but
7 not be limited to, the following factors:
8 (1) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
9 interbasin transfer and use;
10 (2) Any adverse impacts of the proposed interbasin transfer and use;
11 (3) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
12 water in the basin of origin;
13 (4) Any reasonably foreseeable future beneficial uses of the water
14 in the basin of origin;
15 (5) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of leaving the
16 water in the basin of origin for current or future beneficial uses;
17 (6) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
18 and
19 (7) Alternative sources of water available to the basin of origin
20 for future beneficial uses.
21 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
22 overall benefits to the state and the applicant's basin are greater than
23 or equal to the adverse impacts to the state and the basin of origin. The
24 Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying an application
25 shall specify the reasons for such action, including a discussion of the
26 required factors for consideration, and shall document such decision by
27 reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any other sources used by
28 the Chief Water Officer director in making the decision.

8 flow, storage, or storage-use appropriation to a purpose not at that time
9 permitted under the appropriation shall apply for approval of such
10 transfer or change to the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
11 Resources.
12 (b) The application for such approval shall contain (i) the number
13 assigned to such appropriation by the Chief Water Officer department,
14 (ii) the name and address of the present holder of the appropriation,

10 (2) If a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, a
11 copy of the proposed agreement between the current appropriator and the
12 person who is to be responsible for use of water under the appropriation
13 while the transfer or change is in effect shall be submitted at the same
14 time as the application.
15 (3) Regardless of whether a transfer or a change in the purpose of
16 use is involved, the following changes in type of appropriation, if found
17 by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
18 Environment Director of Natural Resources to be consistent with section
19 46-294, may be approved subject to the following:
20 (a) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use may be
21 changed to a natural-flow appropriation for aboveground reservoir storage
22 or for intentional underground water storage;
23 (b) A natural-flow appropriation for intentional underground water
24 storage may be changed to a natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-
25 stream use or for aboveground reservoir storage;
26 (c) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
27 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
28 storage may be changed to an instream appropriation subject to sections
29 46-2,107 to 46-2,119 if the Chief Water Officer director determines that
30 the resulting instream appropriation would be consistent with
31 subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of section 46-2,115;
-63-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 (d) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
2 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
3 storage may be changed to an appropriation for induced ground water
4 recharge if the Chief Water Officer director determines that the
5 resulting appropriation for induced ground water recharge would be
6 consistent with subdivisions (2)(a)(i) and (ii) of section 46-235;
7 (e) An appropriation for the manufacturing of hydropower at a
8 facility located on a natural stream channel may be permanently changed
9 in full to an instream basin-management appropriation to be held jointly
10 by the Game and Parks Commission and any natural resources district or
11 combination of natural resources districts. The beneficial use of such
12 change is to maintain the streamflow for fish, wildlife, and recreation
13 that was available from the manufacturing of hydropower prior to the
14 change. Such changed appropriation may also be utilized by the owners of
15 the appropriation to assist in the implementation of an approved
16 integrated management plan or plans developed pursuant to sections 46-714
17 to 46-718 for each natural resources district within the river basin. Any
18 such change under this section shall be subject to review under sections
19 46-229 to 46-229.06 to ensure that the beneficial uses of the change of
20 use are still being achieved; and
21 (f) The incidental underground water storage portion, whether or not
22 previously quantified, of a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation may
23 be separated from the direct-use portion of the appropriation and may be
24 changed to a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation for intentional
25 underground water storage at the same location if the historic
26 consumptive use of the direct-use portion of the appropriation is
27 transferred to another location or is terminated, but such a separation
28 and change may be approved only if, after the separation and change, (i)
29 the total permissible diversion under the appropriation will not
30 increase, (ii) the projected consequences of the separation and change
31 are consistent with the provisions of any integrated management plan
-64-

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 adopted in accordance with section 46-718 or 46-719 for the geographic
2 area involved, and (iii) if the location of the proposed intentional
3 underground water storage is in a river basin, subbasin, or reach
4 designated as overappropriated in accordance with section 46-713, the
5 integrated management plan for that river basin, subbasin, or reach has
6 gone into effect, and that plan requires that the amount of the
7 intentionally stored water that is consumed after the change will be no
8 greater than the amount of the incidentally stored water that was
9 consumed prior to the change. Approval of a separation and change
10 pursuant to this subdivision (f) shall not exempt any consumptive use
11 associated with the incidental recharge right from any reduction in water
12 use required by an integrated management plan for a river basin,
13 subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated in accordance with
14 section 46-713.
15 Whenever any change in type of appropriation is approved pursuant to
16 this subsection and as long as that change remains in effect, the
17 appropriation shall be subject to the statutes, rules, and regulations
18 that apply to the type of appropriation to which the change has been
19 made.
20 (4) The Legislature finds that induced ground water recharge
21 appropriations issued pursuant to sections 46-233 and 46-235 and instream
22 appropriations issued pursuant to section 46-2,115 are specific to the
23 location identified in the appropriation. Neither type of appropriation
24 shall be transferred to a different location, changed to a different type
25 of appropriation, or changed to permit a different purpose of use.
26 (5) In addition to any other purposes for which transfers and
27 changes may be approved, such transfers and changes may be approved if
28 the purpose is (a) to maintain or augment the flow in a specific stream
29 reach for any instream use that the Chief Water Officer department has
30 determined, through rules and regulations, to be a beneficial use or (b)
31 to increase the frequency that a diversion rate or rate of flow specified
-65-

1 in another valid appropriation is achieved.
2 For any transfer or change approved pursuant to subdivision (a) of
3 this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall be provided
4 with a report at least every five years while such transfer or change is
5 in effect. The purpose of such report shall be to indicate whether the
6 beneficial instream use for which the flow is maintained or augmented
7 continues to exist. If the report indicates that it does not or if no
8 report is filed within sixty days after the Chief Water Officer's
9 department's notice to the appropriator that the deadline for filing the
10 report has passed, the Chief Water Officer department may cancel the its
11 approval of the transfer or change and such appropriation shall revert to
12 the same location of use, type of appropriation, and purpose of use as
13 prior to such approval.
14 (6) A quantified or unquantified appropriation for incidental
15 underground water storage may be transferred to a new location along with
16 the direct-use appropriation with which it is recognized if the Chief
17 Water Officer director finds such transfer to be consistent with section
18 46-294 and determines that the geologic and other relevant conditions at
19 the new location are such that incidental underground water storage will
20 occur at the new location. The Chief Water Officer director may request
21 such information from the applicant as is needed to make such
22 determination and may modify any such quantified appropriation for
23 incidental underground water storage, if necessary, to reflect the
24 geologic and other conditions at the new location.
25 (7) Unless an incidental underground water storage appropriation is
26 changed as authorized by subdivision (3)(f) of this section or is
27 transferred as authorized by subsection (6) of this section or subsection
28 (1) of section 46-291, such appropriation shall be canceled or modified,
29 as appropriate, by the Chief Water Officer director to reflect any
30 reduction in water that will be stored underground as the result of a
31 transfer or change of the direct-use appropriation with which the
-66-

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 incidental underground water storage was recognized prior to the transfer
2 or change.
3 (8) Any appropriation for manufacturing of hydropower changed under
4 subdivision (3)(e) of this section shall maintain the priority date and
5 preference category of the original manufacturing appropriation and shall
6 be subject to condemnation and subordination pursuant to sections 70-668
7 and 70-669. Any person holding a subordination agreement that was
8 established prior to such change of appropriation shall be entitled to
9 enter into a new subordination agreement for terms consistent with the
10 original subordination agreement at no additional cost. Any person having
11 obtained a condemnation award that was established prior to such change
12 of appropriation shall be entitled to the same benefits created by such
13 award, and any obligations created by such award shall become the
14 obligations of the new owner of the appropriation changed under this
15 section.
16 Sec. 111. Section 46-291, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 46-291 (1) Upon receipt of an application filed under section 46-290
19 for a transfer in the location of use of an appropriation, the Chief
20 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall review it for
21 compliance with this subsection. The Chief Water Officer Director of
22 Natural Resources may approve the application without notice or hearing
23 if he or she determines that: (a) The appropriation is used and will
24 continue to be used exclusively for irrigation purposes; (b) the only
25 lands involved in the proposed transfer are (i) lands within the quarter
26 section of land to which the appropriation is appurtenant, (ii) lands

2 increased use of any other source of water at the original location or
3 within the same irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
4 and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company for the
5 original or other purposes, will not diminish the supply of water

1 approved the transfer or change;
2 (h) If the proposed transfer or change is of a storage-use
3 appropriation and if the owner of that appropriation is different from
4 the owner of the associated storage appropriation, the owner of the
5 storage appropriation has approved the transfer or change;
6 (i) If the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent, either
7 (i) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the transfer or
8 change is in the same preference category established by section 46-204
9 as the purpose for which the water is to be used after the transfer or
10 change or (ii) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the
11 transfer or change and the purpose for which the water is to be used
12 after the transfer or change are both purposes for which no preferences
13 are established by section 46-204;
14 (j) If the proposed transfer or change is to be temporary, it will
15 be for a duration of no less than one year and, except as provided in

1 (2) The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed
2 transfer or change will comply with subdivisions (1)(a) through (l) of
3 this section, except that (a) the burden is on a riparian user to
4 demonstrate his or her riparian status and to demonstrate a significant
5 adverse effect on his or her use in order to prevent approval of an
6 application and (b) if both the current use and the proposed use after a
7 transfer are for irrigation, the number of acres to be irrigated will not
8 increase after the transfer, and the location of the diversion from the
9 stream will not change, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
10 transfer will be consistent with subdivision (1)(d) of this section.
11 (3) In approving an application, the Chief Water Officer director
12 may impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to protect the
13 public interest, to ensure consistency with any of the other criteria in
14 subsection (1) of this section, or to provide the Chief Water Officer
15 department with information needed to properly and efficiently administer
16 the appropriation while the transfer or change remains in effect. If
17 necessary to prevent diminution of supply for any other appropriator, the
18 conditions imposed by the Chief Water Officer director shall require that
19 historic return flows be maintained or replaced in quantity, timing, and
20 location. After approval of any such transfer or change, the
21 appropriation shall be subject to all water use restrictions and
22 requirements in effect at any new location of use and, if applicable, at
23 any new diversion location. An appropriation for which a transfer or
24 change has been approved shall retain the same priority date as that of
25 the original appropriation. If an approved transfer or change is
26 temporary, the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation
27 shall revert to the location of use, purpose of use, or type of
28 appropriation prior to the transfer or change.
29 (4) In approving an application for a transfer, the Chief Water
30 Officer director may also authorize the overlying of water appropriations
31 on the same lands, except that if any such overlying of appropriations

1 would result in either the authorized diversion rate or the authorized
2 aggregate annual quantity that could be diverted to be greater than is
3 otherwise permitted by section 46-231, the Chief Water Officer director
4 shall limit the total diversion rate or aggregate annual quantity for the
5 appropriations overlain to the rate or quantity that he or she determines
6 is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of
7 crops on the land involved. The Chief Water Officer director may also
8 authorize a greater number of acres to be irrigated if the amount and
9 rate of water approved under the original appropriation is not increased
10 by the change of location. An increase in the number of acres to be
11 irrigated shall be approved only if (a) such an increase will not
12 diminish the supply of water available to or otherwise adversely affect
13 another water appropriator or (b) the transfer would not adversely affect
14 the water supply for any river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been
15 designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined
16 to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 and (i) the number of
17 acres authorized under the appropriation when originally approved has not
18 been increased previously, (ii) the increase in the number of acres
19 irrigated will not exceed five percent of the number of acres being
20 irrigated under the permit before the proposed transfer or a total of ten
21 acres, whichever acreage is less, and (iii) all the use will be either on
22 the quarter section to which the appropriation was appurtenant before the
23 transfer or on an adjacent quarter section.
24 Sec. 115. Section 46-294.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,

26 46-294.01 Whenever a temporary transfer is approved in accordance
27 with sections 46-290 to 46-294, the applicant shall, within sixty days
28 after the order of approval of the Chief Water Officer Department of
29 Natural Resources, cause copies of the following to be filed with the
30 county clerk or register of deeds of the county in which the land subject
31 to the appropriation prior to the transfer is located: (1) The permit by

1 which the appropriation was established; (2) the agreement by which the
2 temporary transfer is to be effected; and (3) the order of the Chief
3 Water Officer Director of Natural Resources approving the temporary
4 transfer. Whenever renewal of a temporary transfer is approved pursuant
5 to section 46-294.02, the applicant shall, within sixty days after such
6 approval, cause a copy of the order of the Chief Water Officer director
7 approving such renewal to be filed with the county clerk or register of
8 deeds of such county. Such documents shall be indexed to the land subject
9 to the appropriation prior to the transfer. The applicant shall file with
10 the Chief Water Officer department, within ninety days after the Chief
11 Water Officer's department's order of approval, proof of filing with the
12 county clerk or register of deeds. Failure to file such proof of filing
13 within such ninety-day time period shall be grounds for the Chief Water
14 Officer director to negate any prior approval of the transfer or renewal.
15 Sec. 116. Section 46-294.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
16 is amended to read:
17 46-294.02 A temporary transfer or a change in the type or purpose of
18 use of an appropriation may be renewed or otherwise extended by the
19 parties thereto at any time following the midpoint of the transfer or
20 change term, but any such renewal or extension is subject to review and
21 approval pursuant to sections 46-290 to 46-294. No renewal or extension
22 shall cause the term of any such temporary transfer or change to exceed
23 thirty years in duration from the date the renewal or extension is
24 approved by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy,
25 and Environment Director of Natural Resources.
26 Sec. 117. Section 46-294.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,

3 recreation, fish, and wildlife should consider preferences among
4 different uses and that all appropriations should consider the possible
5 legal relationship between surface water and ground water. Thus the
6 Legislature finds that, since such issues have not been fully considered,
7 the director shall not grant any permit to appropriate water, except as
8 specified in subsection (2) of this section, before January 1, 1997, for
9 any application pending on or filed after June 2, 1995.
10 (2) The Chief Water Officer director may grant applications for (a)
11 appropriations for flood control or sediment control structures which
12 will not make or cause to be made any consumptive use of the impounded
13 water, (b) applications for temporary appropriations for public
14 construction that are five cubic feet per second or less, or (c)
15 applications by public water suppliers for induced ground water recharge
16 appropriations pursuant to sections 46-233 to 46-238.

23 consecutive weeks, the last publication to be not later than fourteen
24 years and ten months after the permit was granted or after the date of
25 the Chief Water Officer's director's action following the last such
26 review, whichever is later, and such notice shall be mailed to the
27 appropriator of record and posted on the department's website. The notice
28 shall state that any interested person may file comments relating to the
29 review of the instream appropriation or may request a hearing to present
30 evidence relevant to such review. Any such comments or request for
31 hearing shall be filed with in the Chief Water Officer headquarters

1 office of the department within six weeks after the date of final
2 publication of the notice. The appropriator of record shall, within the
3 six-week period, file written documentation of the continued use of the
4 appropriation. If no requests for hearing are received and if the Chief
5 Water Officer director is satisfied with the information provided by the
6 appropriator of record that the appropriation continues to be
7 beneficially used and is in the public interest, the Chief Water Officer
8 director shall issue an order stating such findings. If requested by any
9 interested person, or on his or her own motion based on the comments and
10 information filed, the Chief Water Officer director shall schedule a
11 hearing. If a hearing is held, the purpose of the hearing shall be to
12 receive evidence regarding whether the water appropriated under the
13 permit still provides the beneficial uses for which the permit was
14 granted and whether the permit is still in the public interest. The
15 hearing shall proceed under the rebuttable presumption that the
16 appropriation continues to provide the beneficial uses for which the
17 permit was granted and that the appropriation is in the public interest.
18 After the hearing, the Chief Water Officer director may by order modify
19 or cancel, in whole or in part, the instream appropriation.

24 responsible for regulation of surface water related activities which
25 contribute to conflicts between ground water users and surface water
26 appropriators or to water supply shortages in fully appropriated or
27 overappropriated river basins, subbasins, or reaches;
28 (6) All involved natural resources districts, the Chief Water
29 Officer department, and surface water project sponsors should cooperate
30 and collaborate on the identification and implementation of management
31 solutions to conflicts between ground water users and surface water

2 overappropriated river basins, subbasins, and reaches; and
3 (7) An Interrelated Water Review Board is needed to resolve any
4 conflicts between the Chief Water Officer department and the involved
5 natural resources districts concerning the content, implementation, or
6 enforcement of integrated management plans for fully appropriated and
7 overappropriated river basins, subbasins, and reaches.

14 made to prevent the levels of ground water contaminants from becoming too
15 high and to reduce high levels sufficiently to eliminate health hazards;
16 (3) Agriculture has been very productive and should continue to be
17 an important industry to the State of Nebraska;
18 (4) Natural resources districts have the legal authority to regulate
19 certain activities and, as local entities, are the preferred regulators
20 of activities which may contribute to ground water contamination in both
21 urban and rural areas;
22 (5) The department is authorized Department of Environment and
23 Energy should be given authority to regulate sources of contamination
24 when necessary to prevent serious deterioration of ground water quality;
25 (6) The powers given to districts and the department Department of
26 Environment and Energy should be used to stabilize, reduce, and prevent
27 the increase or spread of ground water contamination; and
28 (7) There is a need to provide for the orderly management of ground
29 water quality in areas where available data, evidence, and other
30 information indicate that present or potential ground water conditions
31 require the designation of such areas as management areas.

18 Sec. 210. Section 46-711, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 46-711 (1) The Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources
21 shall review any ground water management plan or plan modification
22 submitted by a district to ensure that the best available studies, data,
23 and information, whether previously existing or newly initiated, were
24 utilized and considered and that such plan is supported by and is a
25 reasonable application of such information. If a management area is
26 proposed and the primary purpose of the proposed management area is
27 protection of water quality, the director shall consult with the
28 Department of Environment and Energy regarding approval or denial of the
29 management plan. The Chief Water Officer director shall consult with the
30 Conservation and Survey Division of the University of Nebraska and such

1 deem necessary when reviewing plans. Within ninety days after receipt of
2 a plan, the Chief Water Officer director shall transmit his or her
3 specific findings, conclusions, and reasons for approval or disapproval
4 to the district submitting the plan.
5 (2) If the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources
6 disapproves a ground water management plan, the district which submitted
7 the plan shall, in order to establish a management area, submit to the
8 Chief Water Officer director either the original or a revised plan with
9 an explanation of how the original or revised plan addresses the issues
10 raised by the Chief Water Officer director in his or her reasons for
11 disapproval. Once a district has submitted an explanation pursuant to
12 this section, such district may proceed to schedule a hearing pursuant to
13 section 46-712.
14 Sec. 211. Section 46-712, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 46-712 (1) A natural resources district may establish a ground water
17 management area in accordance with this section to accomplish any one or
18 more of the following objectives: (a) Protection of ground water
19 quantity; (b) protection of ground water quality; or (c) prevention or
20 resolution of conflicts between users of ground water and appropriators
21 of surface water, which ground water and surface water are hydrologically
22 connected.
23 (2) Prior to establishment by a district of a management area other
24 than a management area being established in accordance with section
25 46-718, the district's management plan shall have been approved by the
26 Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources or the district shall
27 have completed the requirements of subsection (2) of section 46-711. If
28 necessary to determine whether a management area should be designated,
29 the district may initiate new studies and data-collection efforts and
30 develop computer models. In order to establish a management area, the
31 district shall fix a time and place for a public hearing to consider the
-150-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 management plan information supplied by the Chief Water Officer director
2 and to hear any other evidence. The hearing shall be located within or in
3 reasonable proximity to the area proposed for designation as a management
4 area. Notice of the hearing shall be published as provided in section
5 46-743, and the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with such
6 section.
7 (3)(a) Within ninety days after the hearing, the district shall
8 determine whether a management area shall be designated. If the district
9 determines that no management area shall be established, the district
10 shall issue an order to that effect.
11 (b) If the district determines that a management area shall be
12 established, the district shall by order designate the area as a
13 management area and shall adopt one or more controls authorized by
14 section 46-739 to be utilized within the area in order to achieve the
15 ground water management objectives specified in the plan. Such an order
16 shall include a geographic and stratigraphic definition of the area. The
17 boundaries and controls shall take into account any considerations
18 brought forth at the hearing and administrative factors directly
19 affecting the ability of the district to implement and carry out local
20 ground water management.
21 (c) The controls adopted shall not include controls substantially
22 different from those set forth in the notice of the hearing. The area
23 designated by the order shall not include any area not included in the
24 notice of the hearing.
25 (4) Modification of the boundaries of a district-designated
26 management area or dissolution of such an area shall be in accordance
27 with the procedures established in this section. Hearings for such
28 modifications or for dissolution may not be initiated more often than
29 once a year. Hearings for modification of controls may be initiated as
30 often as deemed necessary by the district, and such modifications may be
31 accomplished using the procedure in this section.

1 (5) A district shall, prior to adopting or amending any rules or
2 regulations for a management area, consult with any holders of permits
3 for intentional or incidental underground water storage and recovery
4 issued pursuant to section 46-226.02, 46-233, 46-240, 46-241, 46-242, or
5 46-297.
6 (6) If a ground water management area has been adopted by a district
7 under this section that includes one or more controls authorized by
8 subdivision (1)(f) or (1)(m) of section 46-739, the district may request
9 that the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources to conduct
10 an evaluation to determine if an immediate stay should be placed on the
11 issuance of new surface water natural-flow appropriations in the area,
12 river basin, subbasin, or reach of the management area, and the Chief
13 Water Officer department may determine that the stay is in the public
14 interest. The stay may include provisions for exceptions to be granted
15 for beneficial uses as described in subsection (3) of section 46-714 or
16 for a project that provides hydrological benefit to the area of the stay
17 and may include provisions that the stay may be rescinded based on new or
18 additional information that may become available.
19 Sec. 212. Section 46-713, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:
21 46-713 (1)(a) By January 1 of each year beginning in 2006 and except
22 as otherwise provided in this section and section 46-720, the Chief Water
23 Officer Department of Natural Resources shall complete an evaluation of
24 the expected long-term availability of hydrologically connected water
25 supplies for both existing and new surface water uses and existing and
26 new ground water uses in each of the state's river basins and shall issue
27 a report that describes the results of the evaluation. For purposes of
28 the evaluation and the report, a river basin may be divided into two or
29 more subbasins or reaches. A river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an
30 integrated management plan has been or is being developed pursuant to
31 sections 46-715 to 46-717 or pursuant to section 46-719 shall not be
-152-
AM711 AM711

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 evaluated unless it is being reevaluated as provided in subsection (2) of
2 this section. For each river basin, subbasin, or reach evaluated, the
3 report shall describe (i) the nature and extent of use of both surface
4 water and ground water in each river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the
5 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department
6 preliminarily considers surface water and ground water to be
7 hydrologically connected and the criteria used for that determination,
8 and (iii) the extent to which the then-current uses affect available
9 near-term and long-term water supplies. River basins, subbasins, and
10 reaches designated as overappropriated in accordance with subsection (4)
11 of this section shall not be evaluated by the Chief Water Officer
12 department. The Chief Water Officer department is not required to perform
13 an annual evaluation for a river basin, subbasin, or reach during the
14 four years following a status change in such river basin, subbasin, or
15 reach under subsection (12) of section 46-714.
16 (b) Based on the information reviewed in the evaluation process, the
17 Chief Water Officer department shall arrive at a preliminary conclusion
18 for each river basin, subbasin, and reach evaluated as to whether such
19 river basin, subbasin, or reach presently is fully appropriated without
20 the initiation of additional uses. The Chief Water Officer department
21 shall also determine if and how such preliminary conclusion would change
22 if no additional legal constraints were imposed on future development of
23 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water and reasonable
24 projections are made about the extent and location of future development
25 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach.
26 (c) In addition to the conclusion about whether a river basin,
27 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
28 department shall include in the report, for informational purposes only,
29 a summary of relevant data provided by any interested party concerning
30 the social, economic, and environmental impacts of additional
31 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water uses on resources

1 that are dependent on streamflow or ground water levels but are not
2 protected by appropriations or regulations.
3 (d) In preparing the report, the Chief Water Officer department
4 shall rely on the best scientific data, information, and methodologies
5 readily available to ensure that the conclusions and results contained in
6 the report are reliable. In its report, the Chief Water Officer
7 department shall provide sufficient documentation to allow these data,
8 information, methodologies, and conclusions to be independently
9 replicated and assessed. Upon request by the Chief Water Officer
10 department, state agencies, natural resources districts, irrigation
11 districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation districts,
12 mutual irrigation companies, canal companies, municipalities, and other
13 water users and stakeholders shall provide relevant data and information
14 in their possession. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
15 Resources shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific
16 data and other information that will be considered for making the
17 preliminary determinations required by this section.
18 (2)(a) The Chief Water Officer department shall complete a
19 reevaluation of a river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated
20 management plan has been or is being prepared if the Chief Water Officer
21 department has reason to believe that a reevaluation might lead to a
22 different determination about whether such river basin, subbasin, or
23 reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated. A decision to reevaluate
24 may be reached by the Chief Water Officer department on its own or in
25 response to a petition filed with the Chief Water Officer department by
26 any interested person. To be considered sufficient to justify a
27 reevaluation, a petition shall be accompanied by supporting information
28 showing that (i) new scientific data or other information relevant to the
29 determination of whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
30 appropriated or overappropriated has become available since the last
31 evaluation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the Chief Water
-154-

LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 Officer department relied on incorrect or incomplete information when the
2 river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated, or (iii) the Chief
3 Water Officer department erred in the its interpretation or application
4 of the information available when the river basin, subbasin, or reach was
5 last evaluated. If a petition determined by the Chief Water Officer
6 department to be sufficient is filed before July 1 of any year, the
7 reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved shall be
8 included in the next annual report prepared in accordance with subsection
9 (1) of this section. If any such petition is filed on or after July 1 of
10 any year, the Chief Water Officer department may defer the reevaluation
11 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved until the second annual
12 report after such filing.
13 (b) If the reevaluation results in a different determination by the
14 Chief Water Officer department, then (i) the Chief Water Officer
15 department shall notify, by certified mail, the affected natural
16 resources districts and any irrigation district, public power and
17 irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
18 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach of the preliminary change in the determination and
20 (ii) the Chief Water Officer department shall hold one or more public
21 hearings not more than ninety days after the publication of the notice
22 required in subdivision (b)(i) of this subsection. Notice of the hearings
23 shall be provided in the same manner as the notice required in subsection
24 (1) of section 46-714. Any interested person may appear at the hearing
25 and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
26 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
27 (c) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subdivision (b)
28 of this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
29 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
30 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
31 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.

1 (3) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed fully
2 appropriated if the Chief Water Officer department determines based upon
3 the its evaluation conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
4 and information presented at the hearing pursuant to subsection (4) of
5 section 46-714 that then-current uses of hydrologically connected surface
6 water and ground water in the river basin, subbasin, or reach cause or
7 will in the reasonably foreseeable future cause (a) the surface water
8 supply to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the beneficial or
9 useful purposes for which existing natural-flow or storage appropriations
10 were granted and the beneficial or useful purposes for which, at the time
11 of approval, any existing instream appropriation was granted, (b) the
12 streamflow to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the
13 beneficial uses from wells constructed in aquifers dependent on recharge
14 from the river or stream involved, or (c) reduction in the flow of a
15 river or stream sufficient to cause noncompliance by Nebraska with an
16 interstate compact or decree, other formal state contract or agreement,
17 or applicable state or federal laws.
18 (4)(a) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed
19 overappropriated if, on July 16, 2004, the river basin, subbasin, or
20 reach is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among three or
21 more states and if, prior to such date, the Chief Water Officer
22 department has declared a moratorium on the issuance of new surface water
23 appropriations in such river basin, subbasin, or reach and has requested
24 each natural resources district with jurisdiction in the affected area in
25 such river basin, subbasin, or reach either (i) to close or to continue
26 in effect a previously adopted closure of all or part of such river
27 basin, subbasin, or reach to the issuance of additional water well
28 permits in accordance with subdivision (1)(k) of section 46-656.25 as
29 such section existed prior to July 16, 2004, or (ii) to temporarily
30 suspend or to continue in effect a temporary suspension, previously
31 adopted pursuant to section 46-656.28 as such section existed prior to

1 July 16, 2004, on the drilling of new water wells in all or part of such
2 river basin, subbasin, or reach.
3 (b) Within sixty days after July 16, 2004, the Chief Water Officer
4 department shall designate which river basins, subbasins, or reaches are
5 overappropriated. The designation shall include a description of the
6 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department has
7 determined that surface water and ground water are hydrologically
8 connected and the criteria used to make such determination.
9 Sec. 213. Section 46-714, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 46-714 (1) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
12 Resources makes a preliminary determination that a river basin, subbasin,
13 or reach not previously designated as overappropriated and not previously
14 determined to be fully appropriated has become fully appropriated, the
15 Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate stay on the
16 issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations
17 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer
18 department shall also provide prompt notice of such preliminary
19 determination to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to
20 each natural resources district that encompasses any of the geographic
21 area involved. Such notice to natural resources districts shall be by
22 certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the manager of the
23 natural resources district or his or her designee and shall include the
24 signature of the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources.
25 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by the natural resources
26 district, there shall be a stay on issuance of water well construction
27 permits in the geographic area preliminarily determined by the Chief
28 Water Officer department to include hydrologically connected surface
29 water and ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief
30 Water Officer department shall also notify the public of the preliminary
31 determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
-157-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317

1 appropriated and of the affected geographic area. Such notice shall be
2 provided by publication once each week for three consecutive weeks in at
3 least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in such other newspaper
4 or newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
5 department to provide general circulation in the river basin, subbasin,
6 or reach.
7 (2) If the Chief Water Officer department preliminarily determines a
8 river basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated and has
9 identified the existence of hydrologically connected surface water and
10 ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach, stays shall also be
11 imposed:
12 (a) On the construction of any new water well in the area covered by
13 the determination unless a permit with conditions imposed by the natural
14 resources district has been issued prior to the determination. Such
15 conditions shall meet the objectives of subsection (4) of section 46-715
16 and may include, but are not limited to, conditions in accordance with
17 subsection (6) of section 46-739. Any well constructed pursuant to such
18 permit shall be completed in accordance with section 46-738; and
19 (b) On the use of an existing water well or an existing surface
20 water appropriation in the affected area to increase the number of acres
21 historically irrigated.
22 Such additional stays shall begin ten days after the first
23 publication, in a newspaper of statewide circulation, of the notice of
24 the preliminary determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is
25 fully appropriated.
26 (3) Exceptions to the stays imposed pursuant to subsection (1), (2),
27 (8), or (9) of this section shall exist for (a) test holes, (b)
28 dewatering wells with an intended use of one year or less, (c) monitoring

22 determination made in subsection (1) of this section and completed in
23 accordance with section 46-738 but were not used for irrigation prior to
24 that effective date, (l) to the extent permitted by the applicable
25 natural resources district, increases in ground water irrigated acres
26 that result from the use of water wells that are constructed after the
27 effective date of the stay in accordance with a permit granted by that
28 natural resources district prior to the effective date of the stay, (m)
29 surface water uses for which temporary public-use construction permits
30 are issued pursuant to subsection (8) of section 46-233, (n) surface

5 the effective date of the stay.
6 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any stay imposed
7 pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall remain in
8 effect for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach until the Chief
9 Water Officer department has made a final determination regarding whether
10 the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and, if the
11 Chief Water Officer's department's final determination is that the river
12 basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, shall remain in effect
13 as provided in subsection (11) of this section. Within the time period
14 between the dates of the preliminary and final determinations, the Chief
15 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
16 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public
17 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
18 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
20 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
21 resources districts. The Chief Water Officer department shall also hold
22 one or more public hearings not more than ninety days after the first
23 publication of the notice required by subsection (1) of this section.
24 Notice of the hearings shall be provided in the same manner as the notice
25 required by such subsection. Any interested person may appear at such
26 hearing and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
27 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Chief
28 Water Officer's department's preliminary conclusions about the extent of
29 the area within which the surface water and ground water supplies for the
30 river basin, subbasin, or reach are determined to be hydrologically
31 connected, and whether the stays on new uses should be terminated.

1 (5) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subsection (4)
2 of this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
3 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
4 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
5 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach. If the final determination is
6 that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief
7 Water Officer department, at the same time, shall (a) decide whether to
8 continue or to terminate the stays on new surface water uses and on
9 increases in the number of surface water irrigated acres and (b)
10 designate the geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer
11 department considers surface water and ground water to be hydrologically
12 connected in the river basin, subbasin, or reach and describe the methods
13 and criteria used in making that determination. The Chief Water Officer
14 department shall provide notice of its decision to continue or terminate
15 the stays in the same manner as the notice required by subsection (1) of
16 this section.
17 (6) Within ninety days after a final determination by the Chief
18 Water Officer department that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
19 appropriated, an affected natural resources district may hold one or more
20 public hearings on the question of whether the stays on the issuance of
21 new water well permits, on the construction of new water wells, or on
22 increases in ground water irrigated acres should be terminated. Notice of
23 the hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
24 (7) Within forty-five days after a natural resources district's
25 final hearing pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the natural
26 resources district shall decide (a) whether to terminate the stay on new
27 water wells in all or part of the natural resources district subject to
28 the stay and (b) whether to terminate the stay on increases in ground
29 water irrigated acres. If the natural resources district decides not to
30 terminate the stay on new water wells in any geographic area, it shall
31 also decide whether to exempt from such stay the construction of water

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 wells for which permits were issued prior to the issuance of the stay but
2 for which construction had not begun prior to issuance of the stay. If
3 construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior to the
4 stay is allowed, all permits that were valid when the stay went into
5 effect shall be extended by a time period equal to the length of the
6 stay.
7 (8) Whenever the Chief Water Officer department designates a river
8 basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, each previously declared
9 moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in the
10 river basin, subbasin, or reach shall continue in effect. The Chief Water
11 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of such designation
12 to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to each natural
13 resources district that encompasses any of the geographic area involved.
14 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by a natural resources district,
15 there shall be a stay on the issuance of new water well construction
16 permits in any portion of such natural resources district that is within
17 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
18 department. The Chief Water Officer department shall also notify the
19 public of its designation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach as
20 overappropriated and of the geographic area involved in such designation.
21 Such notice shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks
22 in at least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in such other
23 newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
24 department to provide general notice in the river basin, subbasin, or
25 reach.
26 (9) Beginning ten days after the first publication of notice under
27 subsection (8) of this section in a newspaper of statewide circulation,
28 there shall also be stays (a) on the construction of any new water well
29 in the hydrologically connected area if such construction has not
30 commenced prior to such date and if no permit for construction of the
31 water well has been issued previously by either the Chief Water Officer

1 department or the natural resources district, (b) on the use of an
2 existing water well in the hydrologically connected area to increase the
3 number of acres historically irrigated, and (c) on the use of an existing
4 surface water appropriation to increase the number of acres historically
5 irrigated in the affected area.
6 (10) Within ninety days after a designation by the Chief Water
7 Officer department of a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
8 overappropriated, a natural resources district that encompasses any of
9 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
10 department may hold one or more public hearings on the question of
11 whether to terminate the stays on (a) the construction of new water wells
12 within all or part of its portion of the hydrologically connected area,
13 (b) the issuance of new water well construction permits in such area, or
14 (c) the increase in ground water irrigated acres in such area. Notice of
15 any hearing for such purpose shall be provided pursuant to section
16 46-743. Prior to the scheduling of a natural resources district hearing
17 on the question of whether to terminate any such stay, the Chief Water
18 Officer department and the affected natural resources district shall
19 consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
20 and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
21 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
22 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
23 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
24 resources district.
25 (11) Any stay issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect
26 until (a) the stay has been terminated pursuant to subsection (5), (7),
27 or (10) of this section, (b) an integrated management plan for the
28 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Chief
29 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts and
30 has taken effect, (c) an integrated management plan for the affected
31 river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Interrelated

1 Water Review Board and has taken effect, (d) the Chief Water Officer
2 department has completed a reevaluation pursuant to subsection (2) of
3 section 46-713 and has determined that the affected river basin,
4 subbasin, or reach is not fully appropriated or overappropriated, or (e)
5 the stay expires pursuant to this subsection. Such stay may be imposed
6 initially for not more than three years following the Chief Water
7 Officer's department's designation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach
8 as overappropriated or the Chief Water Officer's department's final
9 determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
10 appropriated and may be extended thereafter on an annual basis by
11 agreement of the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
12 resources district for not more than two additional years if necessary to
13 allow the development, adoption, and implementation of an integrated
14 management plan pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-719.
15 (12)(a) For purposes of this subsection, (i) a status change occurs
16 when a preliminary or final determination that a river basin, subbasin,
17 or reach is fully appropriated is reversed by the Chief Water Officer
18 department or by judicial determination and such river basin, subbasin,
19 or reach is determined not to be fully appropriated and (ii) the
20 hydrologically connected area means the geographic area within which the
21 Chief Water Officer department considers surface water and ground water
22 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach to be hydrologically connected.
23 (b) If a status change occurs, any stays previously in force by the
24 Chief Water Officer department or affected natural resources districts
25 shall remain in force until the stays imposed under this subsection are
26 in place and the Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate
27 stay on the issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use
28 appropriations in the river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water
29 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of the status change
30 in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. Immediately upon
31 receipt of the notice by the affected natural resources district, there
-164-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 shall be stays imposed as set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this
2 section, subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (3) of this
3 section. The stays imposed pursuant to this subsection shall remain in
4 effect within each affected natural resources district until such
5 district adopts rules and regulations in accordance with subdivision (c),
6 (d), or (e) of this subsection.
7 (c) Upon receipt of notice of a status change, each affected natural
8 resources district shall adopt rules and regulations within one hundred
9 twenty days after receipt of such notice for the prioritization and
10 granting of water well permits within the hydrologically connected area
11 for the four-year period following the status change. Nothing in this
12 subsection shall be construed to supersede the authority provided to
13 natural resources districts under subsection (2) of section 46-707 and
14 subdivisions (1)(f) and (1)(m) of section 46-739.
15 (d) The rules and regulations adopted by each affected natural
16 resources district in accordance with subdivision (c) of this subsection
17 shall (i) allow a limited number of total new ground water irrigated
18 acres annually, (ii) be created with the purpose of maintaining the
19 status of not fully appropriated based on the most recent basin
20 determination, (iii) be for a term of not less than four years, and (iv)
21 limit the number of new permits so that total new ground water irrigated
22 acres do not exceed the number set in the rules and regulations. The
23 Chief Water Officer department shall approve the proposed new number of
24 ground water irrigated acres within sixty days after approval by the
25 natural resources district if such district meets the conditions set
26 forth in subdivision (d)(ii) of this subsection, based on the most recent
27 basin determination.
28 (e) If the proposed new number of acres is not approved by the Chief
29 Water Officer department within the applicable time period as provided in
30 subdivision (d) of this subsection, the affected natural resources
31 districts shall adopt rules and regulations that allow water well permits

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 to be issued that will result in no more than two thousand five hundred
2 irrigated acres or that will result in an increase of not more than
3 twenty percent of all historically irrigated acres within the
4 hydrologically connected area of each natural resources district within
5 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, whichever is less, for each
6 calendar year of the four-year period following the date of the
7 determination described in this subsection. Each affected natural
8 resources district may, after the initial four-year period has expired,
9 annually determine whether water well permit limitations should continue
10 and may enforce such limitations.
11 (f) During the four-year period following the status change, the
12 Chief Water Officer department shall ensure that any new appropriation
13 granted will not cause the basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully
14 appropriated based on the most recent basin determination. The Chief
15 Water Officer department, pursuant to its rules and regulations adopted
16 and promulgated under the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection
17 Act, shall not issue new natural flow surface water appropriations for
18 irrigation, within the river basin, subbasin, or reach affected by the
19 status change, that will result in a net increase of more than eight
20 hundred thirty-four irrigated acres in each natural resources district
21 during each calendar year of the four-year period following the date of
22 the determination described in this subsection.
23 Sec. 214. Section 46-715, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-715 (1)(a) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
26 Resources has designated a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
27 overappropriated or has made a final determination that a river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the natural resources districts
29 encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach and the Chief Water
30 Officer department shall jointly develop an integrated management plan
31 for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The plan shall be completed,
-166-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 adopted, and take effect within three years after such designation or
2 final determination unless the Chief Water Officer department and the
3 natural resources districts jointly agree to an extension of not more
4 than two additional years.
5 (b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin,
6 subbasin, or reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or
7 has not been finally determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly
8 with the Chief Water Officer department, develop an integrated management
9 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach located within the
10 district. The district shall notify the Chief Water Officer department of
11 its intention to develop an integrated management plan which shall be
12 developed and adopted according to sections 46-715 to 46-717 and
13 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-718. The objective of an integrated
14 management plan under this subdivision is to manage such river basin,
15 subbasin, or reach to achieve and sustain a balance between water uses
16 and water supplies for the long term. If a district develops an
17 integrated management plan under this subdivision and the Chief Water
18 Officer department subsequently determines the affected river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
20 department and the affected natural resources district may amend the
21 integrated management plan.
22 (2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects of
23 existing and potential new water uses on existing surface water
24 appropriators and ground water users shall be considered. An integrated
25 management plan shall include the following: (a) Clear goals and
26 objectives with a purpose of sustaining a balance between water uses and
27 water supplies so that the economic viability, social and environmental
28 health, safety, and welfare of the river basin, subbasin, or reach can be
29 achieved and maintained for both the near term and the long term; (b) a
30 map clearly delineating the geographic area subject to the integrated
31 management plan; (c) one or more of the ground water controls authorized
-167-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant to section 46-739;
2 (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized for adoption by
3 the Chief Water Officer department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a
4 plan to gather and evaluate data, information, and methodologies that
5 could be used to implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase
6 understanding of the surface water and hydrologically connected ground
7 water system, and test the validity of the conclusions and information
8 upon which the integrated management plan is based. The plan may also
9 provide for utilization of any applicable incentive programs authorized
10 by law. Nothing in the integrated management plan for a fully
11 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach shall require a natural
12 resources district to regulate ground water uses in place at the time of
13 the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary determination that the
14 river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, unless such
15 regulation is necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of a basin-
16 wide plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a natural resources district
17 may voluntarily adopt such regulations. The applicable natural resources
18 district may decide to include all water users within the district
19 boundary in an integrated management plan.
20 (3) In order to provide a process for economic development
21 opportunities and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin,
22 or reach, the integrated management plan shall include clear and
23 transparent procedures to track depletions and gains to streamflows
24 resulting from new, retired, or other changes to uses within the river
25 basin, subbasin, or reach. The procedures shall:
26 (a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the best
27 available information, data, and science;
28 (b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized to
29 estimate depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes
30 location, amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to
31 new uses;
-168-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 (c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not have
2 more than a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground
3 water users;
4 (d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and the Chief
5 Water Officer department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share
6 information on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting
7 water use in the river basin, subbasin, or reach;
8 (e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available to
9 mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
10 interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use
11 management, and use retirement;
12 (f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans after
13 consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
14 districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts,
15 municipalities, other political subdivisions, and other water users to
16 make water available for offset to enhance and encourage economic
17 development opportunities and economic sustainability in the river basin,
18 subbasin, or reach; and
19 (g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses shall
20 take to apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.
21 Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment of an
22 integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.
23 (4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed for
24 adoption in the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1) of
25 this section shall, when considered together and with any applicable
26 incentive programs, (a) be consistent with the goals and objectives of
27 the plan, (b) be sufficient to ensure that the state will remain in
28 compliance with applicable state and federal laws and with any applicable
29 interstate water compact or decree or other formal state contract or
30 agreement pertaining to surface water or ground water use or supplies,
31 and (c) protect the ground water users whose water wells are dependent on
-169-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 recharge from the river or stream involved and the surface water
2 appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion caused by
3 surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a river
4 basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily
5 determined to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713,
6 after the date of such designation or preliminary determination.
7 (5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
8 overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more
9 natural resources districts, the Chief Water Officer department and the
10 affected natural resources districts shall jointly develop a basin-wide
11 plan for the area designated as overappropriated. Such plan shall be
12 developed using the consultation and collaboration process described in
13 subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be developed concurrently with
14 the development of the integrated management plan required pursuant to
15 subsections (1) through (4) of this section, and shall be designed to
16 achieve, in the incremental manner described in subdivision (d) of this
17 subsection, the goals and objectives described in subsection (2) of this
18 section. The basin-wide plan shall be adopted after hearings by the Chief
19 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
20 (b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
21 overappropriated and subject to this subsection, the Chief Water Officer
22 department and each natural resources district encompassing such river
23 basin, subbasin, or reach shall jointly develop an integrated management
24 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach pursuant to subsections (1)
25 through (4) of this section. Each integrated management plan for a river
26 basin, subbasin, or reach subject to this subsection shall be consistent
27 with any basin-wide plan developed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
28 subsection. Such integrated management plan shall be developed after
29 consultation and collaboration with irrigation districts, reclamation
30 districts, public power and irrigation districts, mutual irrigation
31 companies, canal companies, and municipalities that rely on water from
-170-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 within the affected area and that, after being notified of the
2 commencement of the plan development process, indicate in writing their
3 desire to participate in such process. In addition, the Chief Water
4 Officer department or the affected natural resources districts may
5 include designated representatives of other stakeholders. If agreement is
6 reached by all parties involved in such consultation and collaboration
7 process, the Chief Water Officer department and each natural resources
8 district shall adopt the agreed-upon integrated management plan. If
9 agreement cannot be reached by all parties involved, the integrated
10 management plan shall be developed and adopted by the Chief Water Officer
11 department and the affected natural resources district pursuant to
12 sections 46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board
13 pursuant to section 46-719.
14 (c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
15 shall identify the overall difference between the current and fully
16 appropriated levels of development. Such determination shall take into
17 account cyclical supply, including drought, identify the portion of the
18 overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
19 development that is due to conservation measures, and identify the
20 portions of the overall difference between the current and fully
21 appropriated levels of development that are due to water use initiated
22 prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated on or after such date.
23 (d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
24 shall adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives
25 identified under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following
26 steps:
27 (i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact of
28 streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water
29 wells constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to
30 the extent those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1,
31 1997, and, unless an interstate cooperative agreement for such river
-171-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 basin, subbasin, or reach is no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow
2 depletions that would cause noncompliance by Nebraska with such
3 interstate cooperative agreement. During the first increment, the Chief
4 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
5 shall also pursue voluntary efforts, subject to the availability of
6 funds, to offset any increase in streamflow depletive effects that occur
7 after July 1, 1997, but are caused by ground water uses initiated prior
8 to such date. The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
9 resources districts may also use other appropriate and authorized
10 measures for such purpose;
11 (ii) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
12 resources districts may amend an integrated management plan subject to
13 this subsection (5) as necessary based on an annual review of the
14 progress being made toward achieving the goals for that increment;
15 (iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated
16 management plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten
17 years after the adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated
18 management plan pursuant to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the
19 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
20 district shall conduct a technical analysis of the actions taken in such
21 increment to determine the progress towards meeting the goals and
22 objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The
23 analysis shall include an examination of (A) available supplies and
24 changes in long-term availability, (B) the effects of conservation
25 practices and natural causes, including, but not limited to, drought, and
26 (C) the effects of the plan on reducing the overall difference between
27 the current and fully appropriated levels of development identified in
28 subdivision (5)(c) of this section. The analysis shall determine whether
29 a subsequent increment is necessary in the integrated management plan to
30 meet the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this
31 section and reduce the overall difference between the current and fully
-172-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of
2 this section;
3 (iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii) of this
4 subsection, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
5 resources districts, utilizing the consultative and collaborative process
6 described in subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall if necessary
7 identify goals for a subsequent increment of the integrated management
8 plan. Subsequent increments shall be completed, adopted, and take effect
9 not more than ten years after adoption of the previous increment; and
10 (v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii)
11 through (iv) of this subsection shall be repeated until the Chief Water
12 Officer department and the affected natural resources districts agree
13 that the goals and objectives identified pursuant to subsection (2) of
14 this section have been met and the overall difference between the current
15 and fully appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision
16 (5)(c) of this section has been addressed so that the river basin,
17 subbasin, or reach has returned to a fully appropriated condition.
18 (6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
19 fully appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure
20 that the state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a
21 formal state contract or agreement, the Chief Water Officer department,
22 in consultation with the affected districts, shall forecast on an annual
23 basis the maximum amount of water that may be available from streamflow
24 for beneficial use in the short term and long term in order to comply
25 with the requirement of subdivision (4)(b) of this section. This forecast
26 shall be made by January 1, 2008, and each January 1 thereafter.
27 Sec. 215. Section 46-716, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-716 (1) The surface water controls that may be included in an
30 integrated management plan and may be adopted by the Chief Water Officer
31 Department of Natural Resources are: (a) Increased monitoring and

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 enforcement of surface water diversion rates and amounts diverted
2 annually; (b) the prohibition or limitation of additional surface water
3 appropriations; (c) requirements for surface water appropriators to apply
4 or utilize reasonable conservation measures consistent with good
5 husbandry and other requirements of section 46-231 and consistent with
6 reasonable reliance by other surface water or ground water users on
7 return flows or on seepage to the aquifer; and (d) other reasonable
8 restrictions on surface water use which are consistent with the intent of
9 section 46-715 and the requirements of section 46-231.
10 (2) If during the development of the integrated management plan the
11 Chief Water Officer department determines that surface water
12 appropriators should be required to apply or utilize conservation
13 measures or that other reasonable restrictions on surface water use need
14 to be imposed, the Chief Water Officer's department's portion of the
15 integrated management plan shall allow the affected surface water
16 appropriators and surface water project sponsors a reasonable amount of
17 time, not to exceed one hundred eighty days unless extended by the Chief
18 Water Officer department, to identify the conservation measures to be
19 applied or utilized, to develop a schedule for such application and
20 utilization, and to comment on any other proposed restrictions.
21 Sec. 216. Section 46-717, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-717 (1) In developing an integrated management plan, the Chief
24 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources and the affected natural
25 resources districts shall utilize the best scientific data and other
26 information available and shall review and consider any rules and
27 regulations in effect in any existing ground water management area that
28 encompasses all or part of the geographic area to be encompassed by the
29 plan. Consideration shall be given to the applicable scientific data and
30 other information relied upon by the Chief Water Officer department in
31 preparing the annual report required by section 46-713 and to other types

1 of data and information that may be deemed appropriate by the Chief Water
2 Officer department. The Chief Water Officer department, after seeking
3 input from the affected natural resources districts, shall specify by
4 rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other information
5 that will be considered in developing an integrated management plan. The
6 natural resources districts shall adopt similar rules and regulations
7 specifying the types of scientific data and other information necessary
8 for purposes of this section. Existing research, data, studies, or any
9 other relevant information which has been compiled by or is in possession
10 of other state or federal agencies, other natural resources districts,
11 and other political subdivisions within the State of Nebraska shall be
12 utilized. State agencies and political subdivisions shall furnish
13 information or data upon request of the Chief Water Officer department or
14 any affected natural resources district. Neither the Chief Water Officer
15 department nor the natural resources districts shall be required to
16 conduct new research or to develop new computer models to prepare an
17 integrated management plan, but such new research may be conducted or new
18 computer models developed within the limits of available funding if the
19 additional information is desired by the Chief Water Officer department

21 (2) During preparation of an integrated management plan for a fully
22 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach or of an integrated
23 management plan under subdivision (1)(b) of section 46-715, the Chief
24 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
25 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public
26 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
27 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
29 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or by the affected
30 natural resources districts. They shall also actively solicit public
31 comments and opinions through public meetings and other means.

1 Sec. 217. Section 46-718, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 46-718 (1) If the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
4 Resources and the affected natural resources districts preparing an
5 integrated management plan reach agreement on (a) the proposed goals and
6 objectives of the plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach,
7 (b) the proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (c) the
8 surface water and ground water controls and any incentive programs that
9 are proposed for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
10 subbasin, or reach, they shall schedule one or more public hearings to
11 take testimony on the proposed integrated management plan and the
12 proposed controls. Such hearings shall be held within forty-five days
13 after reaching agreement and within or in reasonable proximity to the
14 area to be affected by implementation of the integrated management plan.
15 Notice of such hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
16 The costs of publishing the notice shall be shared between the Chief
17 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
18 All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present testimony
19 or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being considered.
20 (2) Within sixty days after the final hearing under this section,
21 the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
22 districts shall jointly decide whether to implement the plan proposed,
23 with or without modifications, and whether to adopt and implement the
24 surface water and ground water controls and incentive programs proposed
25 in the plan. If the Chief Water Officer department and the natural
26 resources districts agree to implement the plan and to adopt and
27 implement the proposed controls, the natural resources districts shall by
28 order designate a ground water management area for integrated management
29 or, if the geographic area subject to the integrated management plan is
30 already in a ground water management area, the order shall designate an
31 integrated management subarea for that area. The order shall include a

LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 geographic and stratigraphic definition of the ground water management
2 area or integrated management subarea and shall adopt the controls in the
3 integrated management plan that are authorized for adoption by the
4 natural resources district pursuant to section 46-739. The Chief Water
5 Officer department shall by order adopt the controls in the integrated
6 management plan that are authorized for adoption by the Chief Water
7 Officer department pursuant to section 46-716. Neither the controls
8 adopted by the district nor those adopted by the Chief Water Officer
9 department shall include controls substantially different from those set
10 forth in the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water
11 management area or an integrated management subarea by the natural
12 resources district shall not include any area that was not identified in
13 the notice of the hearing as within the area proposed to be subject to
14 the controls in the plan. The Chief Water Officer department and the
15 natural resources district shall each cause a copy of their respective
16 orders its order to be published in the manner provided in section
17 46-744.
18 (3) If at any time during the development of a basin-wide plan or an
19 integrated management plan either the Chief Water Officer department or
20 the affected natural resources districts conclude that the parties will
21 be unable to reach a timely agreement on the basin-wide plan or on (a)
22 the goals and objectives of the integrated management plan for the
23 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, (b) the geographic area to be
24 subject to controls, or (c) the surface water or ground water controls or
25 any incentive programs to be proposed for adoption and implementation in
26 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Governor shall be
27 notified and the dispute shall be submitted to the Interrelated Water
28 Review Board as provided in subsection (2) of section 46-719.
29 Sec. 218. Section 46-719, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 purposes stated in subsections (2) through (5) of this section. The board
2 shall consist of five members. The board, when appointed and convened,
3 shall continue in existence only until it has resolved a dispute referred
4 to it pursuant to such subsections. The Governor shall appoint and
5 convene the board within forty-five days of being notified of the need to
6 resolve a dispute. The board shall be chaired by the Governor or his or
7 her designee, which designee shall be knowledgeable concerning surface
8 water and ground water issues. The Governor shall appoint one additional
9 member of his or her choosing and shall appoint the other three members
10 of the board from a list of no fewer than six nominees provided by the
11 Nebraska Natural Resources Commission within twenty days after request by
12 the Governor for a list of nominees.
13 (b) Not more than two members of the board shall reside in the
14 geographic area involved in the dispute. A person is not eligible for
15 membership on the board if the decisions to be made by the board would or
16 could cause financial benefit or detriment to the person, a member of his
17 or her immediate family, or a business with which the person is
18 associated, unless such benefit or detriment is indistinguishable from
19 the effects of such action on the public generally or a broad segment of
20 the public. The board shall be subject to the Open Meetings Act.
21 (c) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, action
22 may be taken by a vote of three of the board's five members. For purposes

3 disputes over an integrated management plan, the Chief Water Officer
4 department and each affected natural resources district shall present
5 their (i) proposed goals and objectives for the integrated management
6 plan, (ii) proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (iii)
7 proposed surface water and ground water controls and any proposed
8 incentive program for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
9 subbasin, or reach involved. The Chief Water Officer department and each
10 affected natural resources district shall also be given adequate
11 opportunity to comment on the proposals made by the other parties to the
12 dispute.
13 (b) When the Interrelated Water Review Board concludes that the
14 issues in dispute have been fully presented and commented upon by the
15 parties to the dispute, which conclusion shall be made not more than
16 forty-five days after the board is convened, the board shall select the
17 proposals or portions of proposals that the board will consider for
18 adoption and shall schedule one or more public hearings to take testimony
19 on the selected proposals. The hearings shall be held within forty-five
20 days after the board's selection of proposals to consider for adoption
21 and shall be within or in reasonable proximity to the area that would be
22 affected by implementation of any of the proposals to be considered at
23 the hearings. Notice of the hearings shall be published as provided in
24 section 46-743. The cost of publishing the notice shall be shared by the
25 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
26 districts. All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present
27 testimony or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being
28 considered.
29 (c) Within forty-five days after the final hearing pursuant to
30 subdivision (b) of this subsection, the Interrelated Water Review Board
31 shall by order, as applicable, adopt a basin-wide plan or an integrated
-179-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 management plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and, in
2 the case of an integrated management plan, shall designate a ground water
3 management area for integrated management or an integrated management
4 subarea for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. An integrated
5 management plan shall be consistent with subsection (2) of section
6 46-715, and the surface water and ground water controls and any
7 applicable incentive programs adopted as part of that plan shall be
8 consistent with subsection (4) of section 46-715. The controls adopted by
9 the board shall not be substantially different from those described in
10 the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water management
11 area or an integrated management subarea shall not include any area that
12 was not identified in the notice of the hearing as within the area
13 proposed to be subject to the controls in the plan.
14 (d) The order adopted under this subsection shall be published in
15 the manner prescribed in section 46-744.
16 (e) Surface water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review
17 Board shall be implemented and enforced by the Chief Water Officer
18 department. Ground water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water
19 Review Board shall be implemented and enforced by the affected natural
20 resources districts.
21 (3) Whether an integrated management plan is adopted pursuant to
22 section 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board pursuant to
23 subsection (2) of this section, the Chief Water Officer department or a
24 natural resources district responsible in part for implementation and
25 enforcement of an integrated management plan may propose modification of
26 the goals or objectives of that plan, of the area subject to the plan, or
27 of the surface water controls, ground water controls, or incentive
28 programs adopted to implement the plan. The Chief Water Officer
29 department and the affected natural resources districts shall utilize the
30 procedures in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement
31 on and to adopt and implement proposed modifications. If agreement on
-180-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 such modifications cannot be achieved utilizing those procedures, either
2 the Chief Water Officer department or an affected natural resources
3 district may notify the Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water
4 Review Board shall be appointed and convened in accordance with
5 subsection (1) of this section to resolve the dispute and, if applicable,
6 to adopt any modifications utilizing the procedures in subsection (2) of
7 this section.
8 (4) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
9 resources districts may also raise objections concerning the
10 implementation or enforcement of previously adopted surface water or
11 ground water controls. The Chief Water Officer department and the
12 affected natural resources districts shall utilize the procedures in
13 sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement on such
14 implementation or enforcement issues. If agreement on such issues cannot
15 be achieved utilizing such procedures, either the Chief Water Officer
16 department or an affected natural resources district may notify the
17 Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
18 appointed and convened in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
19 After permitting each party to fully express the its reasons for the its
20 position taken by each party on the disputed issues, the board may either
21 take no action or conclude (a) that one or more parties needs to modify
22 the party's its approach to implementation or enforcement and direct that
23 such modifications take place or (b) that one or more parties either has
24 not made a good faith effort to implement or enforce the portion of the
25 plan or controls for which the party it is responsible or is unable to
26 fully implement and enforce such portion and that such party's
27 jurisdiction with respect to implementation and enforcement of the plan
28 and controls shall be terminated and reassigned to one or more of the
29 other parties responsible for implementation and enforcement. A decision
30 by the Interrelated Water Review Board to terminate and reassign
31 jurisdiction of any portion of the plan or controls shall take effect
-181-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 immediately upon that decision. Notice of such reassignment shall be
2 published at least once in one or more newspapers as necessary to provide
3 general circulation in the area affected by such reassignment.
4 (5) The board may be reconvened in accordance with subsection (1) of
5 this section at a later date upon request to the Governor by the party
6 for which jurisdiction for implementation and enforcement was terminated
7 if such party desires to have the party's its jurisdiction reinstated,
8 but no such request shall be honored until at least one year after the
9 termination and not more than once per year thereafter. The board may
10 reinstate jurisdiction to that party only upon a clear showing by such
11 party that the party it is willing and able to fully implement and
12 enforce the plan and any applicable controls. Notice that a party's
13 jurisdiction has been reinstated shall be provided in the same manner
14 that notice of the earlier termination was given.
15 Sec. 219. Section 46-720, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 46-720 (1) The Legislature finds that, prior to July 16, 2004,
18 actions were taken by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed
19 prior to July 1, 2025, and by one or more natural resources districts
20 pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed immediately prior
21 to July 16, 2004 such date, for the purpose of addressing circumstances
22 that are, after July 16, 2004 such date, to be addressed in accordance
23 with sections 46-713 to 46-719. It is the intent of the Legislature that
24 actions taken pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed
25 immediately prior to July 16, 2004, should not be negated and that
26 transition from the authorities and responsibilities granted by such
27 section to those granted by sections 46-713 to 46-719 should occur in as
28 efficient a manner as possible. Such transition shall be therefor
29 governed by subsections (2) through (5) of this section, and all
30 references in such subsections to section 46-656.28 shall be construed to
31 mean section 46-656.28 as such section existed immediately prior to July
-182-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 16, 2004.
2 (2) If, prior to July 16, 2004, (a) a natural resources district
3 requested pursuant to subsection (1) of section 46-656.28 that affected
4 appropriators, affected surface water project sponsors, and the
5 department consult and that studies and a hearing be held but (b) the
6 Director of Natural Resources, as such position existed, had has not made
7 a preliminary determination relative to that request pursuant to
8 subsection (2) of section 46-656.28, no further action on the district's
9 request shall be required of the department. If under the same
10 circumstances a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain water
11 wells has been imposed by the district pursuant to subsection (16) of
12 section 46-656.28 and remains in effect immediately prior to July 16,
13 2004, such temporary suspension shall remain in effect for thirty days
14 after the department issues its first annual report under section 46-713,
15 except that (i) such temporary suspension shall not apply to water wells
16 for which a permit has been obtained pursuant to the Municipal and Rural
17 Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act and (ii) to the extent any
18 such temporary suspension is in effect for all or part of a
19 hydrologically connected area for a river basin, subbasin, or reach
20 designated as overappropriated by the department, such temporary
21 suspension shall remain in effect only until it is superseded by the
22 stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section 46-714. To
23 the extent that any such temporary suspension applies to a geographic
24 area preliminarily considered by the department to have ground water
25 hydrologically connected to the surface water of a fully appropriated
26 river basin, subbasin, or reach, such temporary suspension shall be
27 superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of
28 section 46-714.
29 (3)(a) If prior to July 16, 2004, (i) the director has made a
30 preliminary determination pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28
31 that there is reason to believe that the use of hydrologically connected
-183-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 ground water and surface water in a specific geographic area is
2 contributing to or is in the reasonably foreseeable future likely to
3 contribute to any conflict, dispute, or difficulty listed in such
4 subsection, (ii) the director has not made a determination pursuant to
5 subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint action plan should not
6 be prepared, and (iii) preparation of a joint action plan pursuant to
7 subsections (5) through (9) of such section has not been completed, the
8 geographic area involved shall become subject to sections 46-713 to
9 46-719 on July 16, 2004, and the department need not evaluate such
10 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
11 46-713.
12 (b) For purposes of this subsection and section 46-714 and except as
13 otherwise provided in this section, (i) July 16, 2004, shall result in
14 the imposition in any geographic area subject to this subsection of the
15 stays required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714, (ii) such
16 stays shall be imposed in the manner required by such section, and (iii)
17 July 16, 2004, shall be treated as if it were the date of a departmental
18 preliminary determination pursuant to section 46-713 that such area is a
19 geographic area within which ground water and surface water of a fully
20 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach are hydrologically
21 connected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if a
22 temporary suspension in the drilling of certain new water wells has
23 previously been imposed by the affected natural resources district, (A)
24 the stays on construction of new water wells and on the increase in
25 ground water irrigated acres shall be limited in geographic extent to
26 only that part of the affected area within which the temporary suspension
27 was in effect unless the director determines that inclusion of additional
28 area is necessary because ground water and surface water are
29 hydrologically connected in such additional area and (B) the stays on
30 construction of certain new water wells shall not apply to a water well
31 constructed in accordance with the terms of a water well construction

1 permit approved by the district prior to July 16, 2004, unless such well
2 was subject to the district's temporary suspension. If, prior to July 16,
3 2004, the director has held a hearing on a report issued pursuant to
4 subsection (3) of section 46-656.28 but has not yet determined whether a
5 joint action plan should be prepared, no departmental hearing shall be
6 required pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 before a final
7 determination is made about whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach
8 involved is fully appropriated. If, prior to July 16, 2004, the director
9 has determined pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a
10 joint action plan should be prepared, such determination shall have the
11 same effect as a final departmental determination pursuant to subsection
12 (5) of section 46-714 that the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach
13 is fully appropriated and no separate determination to that effect shall
14 be required. If, after July 16, 2004, the department determines that all
15 or part of the area subject to this subsection is in an overappropriated
16 river basin, subbasin, or reach, that portion of the area shall
17 thereafter be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Ground Water
18 Management and Protection Act applicable to an overappropriated river
19 basin, subbasin, or reach and stays that have previously taken effect in
20 accordance with this subsection shall continue in effect as stays for an
21 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach without additional
22 action or publication of notice by the department. Any temporary
23 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells that has been imposed
24 in the geographic area involved by a natural resources district pursuant
25 to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28 prior to July 16, 2004, shall
26 remain in effect until superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to
27 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714.
28 (4) If, prior to July 16, 2004, preparation of a joint action plan
29 has been completed pursuant to subsections (5) through (9) of section
30 46-656.28 but the plan has not yet been adopted pursuant to subsection
31 (11) of such section, the department need not evaluate the affected
-185-
AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
2 46-713. The department and the affected natural resources district shall
3 review the completed joint action plan for its compliance with sections
4 46-715 to 46-717. If the joint action plan is determined to be in
5 compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 or if agreement is reached on
6 the revisions necessary to bring it into such compliance, the department
7 and the district shall adopt the plan and implement the controls as
8 provided in section 46-718. If the joint action plan is determined not to
9 be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 and agreement on the
10 proposed plan or the proposed controls cannot be reached pursuant to
11 section 46-718, section 46-719 shall apply. Except to the extent that any
12 portion of the affected area is designated as all or part of an
13 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach, any temporary
14 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells imposed in the affected
15 geographic area by a natural resources district pursuant to subsection
16 (16) of section 46-656.28 shall remain in effect until (a) the department
17 and the affected district have jointly decided to implement the plan,
18 with or without modifications, and controls have been adopted and taken
19 effect or (b) the Interrelated Water Review Board, pursuant to section
20 46-719, has adopted an integrated management plan for the affected river
21 basin, subbasin, or reach and the controls adopted by the board have
22 taken effect. To the extent that any portion of the affected area is
23 designated as all or part of an overappropriated river basin, subbasin,
24 or reach, any temporary suspension in the drilling of water wells shall
25 be superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of
26 section 46-714.
27 (5) If, before July 16, 2004, a joint action plan has been adopted
28 and implemented pursuant to subsections (10) through (12) of section
29 46-656.28 and is in effect immediately prior to such date, the department
30 need not evaluate the geographic area subject to the plan in the
31 department's first annual report issued pursuant to section 46-713. For

14 amended to read:
15 46-722 If, as a result of information provided pursuant to section
16 46-721 or studies conducted by or otherwise available to the department
17 Department of Environment and Energy and following preliminary
18 investigation, the director Director of Environment and Energy makes a
19 preliminary determination (1) that there is reason to believe that
20 contamination of ground water is occurring or likely to occur in an area
21 of the state in the reasonably foreseeable future and (2) that the
22 natural resources district or districts in which the area is located have
23 not designated a management area or have not implemented adequate
24 controls to prevent such contamination from occurring, the department
25 shall, in cooperation with any appropriate state agency and district,
26 conduct a study to determine the source or sources of the contamination
27 and the area affected by such contamination and shall issue a written
28 report within one year of the initiation of the study. During the study,
29 the department shall consider the relevant water quality portions of the
30 management plan developed by each district pursuant to sections 46-709 to

1 would fail to carry out the intent of the Nebraska Ground Water
2 Management and Protection Act in a reasonably effective and equitable
3 manner, the controls adopted by the district pursuant to this section may
4 contain different provisions for different categories of ground water use
5 or portions of the management area which differ from each other because
6 of varying climatic, hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions. Any
7 differences in such provisions shall recognize and be directed toward
8 such varying ground water uses or varying conditions. Except as otherwise
9 provided in this section, if the district adopts different controls for
10 different categories of ground water use, those controls shall be
11 consistent with section 46-613 and shall, for each such category, be
12 uniform for all portions of the area which have substantially similar
13 climatic, hydrologic, geologic, and soil conditions.
14 (5) The district may establish different water allocations for
15 different irrigation distribution systems.
16 (6)(a) The district may establish different provisions for different
17 hydrologic relationships between ground water and surface water.
18 (b) For management areas a purpose of which is the integrated
19 management of hydrologically connected ground water and surface water,
20 the district may establish different provisions for water wells either
21 permitted or constructed before the designation of a management area for
22 integrated management of hydrologically connected ground water and
23 surface water and for water wells either permitted or constructed on or
24 after the designation date or any other later date or dates established
25 by the district. Permits for construction of new wells not completed by
26 the date of the determination of fully appropriated shall be subject to
27 any conditions imposed by the applicable natural resources district.
28 (c) For a management area in a river basin or part of a river basin
29 that is or was the subject of litigation over an interstate water compact
30 or decree in which the State of Nebraska is a named defendant, the
31 district may establish different provisions for restriction of water

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 wells constructed after January 1, 2001, if such litigation was commenced
2 before or on May 22, 2001. If such litigation is commenced after May 22,
3 2001, the district may establish different provisions for restriction of
4 water wells constructed after the date on which such litigation is
5 commenced in federal court. An appeal from a decision of the district
6 under this subdivision shall be in accordance with the hearing procedures
7 established in the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act.
8 (d) Except as otherwise authorized by law, the district shall make a
9 replacement water well as defined in section 46-602, or as further
10 defined in district rules and regulations, subject to the same provisions
11 as the water well it replaces.
12 (7) If the district has included controls delineated in subdivision
13 (1)(m) of this section in its management plan, but has not implemented
14 such controls within two years after the initial public hearing on the
15 controls, the district shall hold a public hearing, as provided in
16 section 46-712, regarding the controls before implementing them.
17 (8) In addition to the controls listed in subsection (1) of this
18 section, a district in which a management area has been designated may
19 also adopt and implement one or more of the following measures if it
20 determines that any such measures would help the district and water users
21 achieve the goals and objectives of the management area: (a) It may
22 sponsor nonmandatory educational programs; and (b) it may establish and
23 implement financial or other incentive programs. As a condition for
24 participation in an incentive program, the district may require water
25 users or landowners to enter into and perform such agreements or
26 covenants concerning the use of land or water as are necessary to produce
27 the benefits for which the incentive program is established and shall
28 further condition participation upon satisfaction of the requirements of
29 section 46-739.01.

1 involves the delivery of irrigation water and the Chief Water Officer
2 director is a party, may grant a temporary restraining order without
3 notice to the adverse party or his or her attorney only if (a) it clearly
4 appears from specific facts shown by affidavit that immediate and
5 irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant before
6 the adverse party or his or her attorney can be heard in opposition and
7 (b) the applicant or his or her attorney certifies to the court in
8 writing the efforts, if any, which have been made to give such notice and
9 the reasons supporting the applicant's claim that such notice shall not
10 be required.
11 Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall: (i)
12 Be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance; (ii) be filed immediately
13 in the office of the clerk of the district court and entered of record;
14 (iii) define the injury and state why the injury is irreparable and why
15 the order was granted without notice; and (iv) expire by its terms within
16 such time after entry, not to exceed ten days, as the court fixes unless
17 within such fixed time period the order, for good cause shown, is
18 extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is
19 directed consents to an extension for a longer period. The reasons for
20 the extension shall be entered of record. If a temporary restraining
21 order is granted without notice, the motion for a temporary injunction
22 shall be heard at the earliest possible time in the district court and
23 shall take precedence over all matters except older matters of the same
24 character. When the motion for a temporary injunction comes up for
25 hearing, the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall
26 proceed with the application for a temporary injunction, and if he or she
27 does not do so, the district court shall dissolve the temporary
28 restraining order. On two days' notice to the party who obtained the
29 temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to
30 such party as the district court may prescribe, the adverse party may
31 appear and move for the dissolution or modification of the order, and in

4 of the county court, except when the relief demanded involves the
5 delivery of irrigation water and the Chief Water Officer director is a
6 party, may grant a temporary restraining order without notice to the
7 adverse party or his or her attorney only if (a) it clearly appears from
8 specific facts shown by affidavit that immediate and irreparable injury,
9 loss, or damage will result to the applicant before the adverse party or
10 his or her attorney can be heard in opposition and (b) the applicant or
11 his or her attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if
12 any, which have been made to give such notice and the reasons supporting
13 the applicant's claim that such notice shall not be required. The judge
14 of the county court shall direct that reasonable notice be given to the
15 party against whom the temporary restraining order is issued to attend at
16 a specified time or place before the district court or any judge thereof
17 to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued.
18 Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall: (i)
19 Be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance; (ii) be filed immediately
20 in the office of the clerk of the district court and entered of record;
21 (iii) define the injury and state why the injury is irreparable and why
22 the order was granted without notice; and (iv) expire by its terms within
23 such time after entry, not to exceed ten days, as the judge of the county
24 court fixes unless within such fixed time period the order, for good
25 cause shown, is extended by the district court for a like period or
26 unless the party against whom the order is directed consents to an
27 extension for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be
28 entered of record.
29 (5) The Supreme Court or any judge thereof, the Court of Appeals or

2 and the Chief Water Officer director is a party, to grant a restraining
3 order or temporary injunction at the time of the commencement of the
4 action, except when notice by either registered or certified letter has
5 been mailed seventy-two hours prior to the time of hearing to the Chief
6 Water Officer director and the division supervisor in the water division
7 created by section 61-212 in which the action is brought and, in the
8 manner provided in section 25-1062.01, to all appropriators whose rights
9 to the delivery of irrigation water might in any manner be affected, of

11 order or temporary injunction, the Chief Water Officer director,
12 appropriators, or riparian owners shall be entitled to be heard, in
13 person or by their attorney or attorneys, on the question of whether the
14 restraining order should be granted and, if so, in what amount the bond
15 or undertaking is to be fixed.
16 (6) Any person, natural or artificial, injured or likely to be
17 injured by the granting of a restraining order may intervene in the
18 action at any stage of the proceedings and become a party to the

23 accordance with subsection (5) of section 46-229.02, the date, time, and
24 location of the hearing.
25 (2) For any owner whose name and address are known to the Chief
26 Water Officer department or can be reasonably obtained by the Chief Water
27 Officer department, the notice shall be served by personal service or by
28 registered mail or certified mail. Any landowner's name or address shall
29 be considered reasonably obtainable if that person is listed as an owner
30 of the land involved, on the records of the county clerk or register of
31 deeds for the county in which the land is located.

1 (3) For any owner whose name and address are not known to the Chief
2 Water Officer department and cannot reasonably be obtained by the Chief
3 Water Officer department, such notice shall be served by publication in a
4 legal newspaper published or of general circulation in any county in
5 which the place of diversion is located and in a legal newspaper
6 published or of general circulation in each county containing land for
7 which the right to use water under the appropriation is subject to
8 cancellation. Each such publication shall be once each week for three
9 consecutive weeks.
10 (4) Landowners whose property under such appropriation is located
11 within the corporate limits of a city or village shall be served by the
12 publication of such notice in a legal newspaper published or of general
13 circulation in the county in which the city or village is located. The
14 notice shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks.
15 Sec. 80. Section 46-229.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 46-229.04 (1) At a hearing held pursuant to section 46-229.03, the
18 verified field investigation report of an employee of the department, or
19 such other report or information that is relied upon by the Chief Water
20 Officer department to reach the preliminary determination of nonuse,
21 shall be prima facie evidence for the forfeiture and annulment of such
22 water appropriation. If no person appears at the hearing, such water
23 appropriation or unused part thereof shall be declared forfeited and
24 annulled. If an interested person appears and contests the same, the
25 Chief Water Officer department shall hear evidence, and if it appears
26 that such water has not been put to a beneficial use or has ceased to be
27 used for such purpose for more than five consecutive years, the same
28 shall be declared canceled and annulled unless the Chief Water Officer
29 department finds that (a) there has been sufficient cause for such nonuse
30 as provided for in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of this section or (b)
31 subsection (5) or (6) of this section applies.

1 (2) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
2 thirty consecutive years if:
3 (a) Such nonuse was caused by the unavailability of water for that
4 use. For a river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been designated as
5 overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined by the Chief
6 Water Officer department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section
7 46-714, the period of time within which sufficient cause for nonuse
8 because of the unavailability of water may be deemed to exist may be
9 extended beyond thirty years by the Chief Water Officer department upon
10 petition therefor by the owner of the appropriation if the Chief Water
11 Officer department determines that an integrated management plan being
12 implemented in the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved is likely to
13 result in restoration of a usable water supply for the appropriation; or
14 (b) The land subject to the appropriation is under an acreage
15 reserve program or production quota or is otherwise withdrawn from use as
16 required for participation in any federal, state, or natural resources
17 district program, or such land was previously under such a program but
18 currently is not under such a program and there have been not more than
19 five consecutive years of nonuse on such land subsequent to when that
20 land was last under such program.
21 (3) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist
22 indefinitely if such nonuse was the result of one or more of the
23 following:
24 (a) For any tract of land under separate ownership, the available
25 supply was used but on only part of the land under the appropriation
26 because of an inadequate water supply;
27 (b) The appropriation is a storage appropriation and there was an
28 inadequate water supply to provide the water for the storage
29 appropriation or less than the full amount of the storage appropriation
30 was needed to keep the reservoir full; or
31 (c) The appropriation is a storage-use appropriation and there was
-27-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 an inadequate water supply to provide the water for the appropriation or
2 use of the storage water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions.
3 (4) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
4 fifteen consecutive years if such nonuse was a result of one or more of
5 the following:
6 (a) Federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations temporarily
7 prevented or restricted such use;
8 (b) Use of the water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions;
9 (c) Circumstances were such that a prudent person, following the
10 principles of good husbandry, would not have been expected to use the
11 water;
12 (d) The works, diversions, or other facilities essential to use the
13 water were destroyed by a cause not within the control of the owner of
14 the appropriation and good faith efforts to repair or replace the works,
15 diversions, or facilities have been and are being made;
16 (e) The owner of the appropriation was in active involuntary service
17 in the armed forces of the United States or was in active voluntary
18 service during a time of crisis; or
19 (f) Legal proceedings prevented or restricted use of the water.
20 The Chief Water Officer department may specify by rule and
21 regulation other circumstances that shall be deemed to constitute
22 sufficient cause for nonuse for up to fifteen years.
23 (5) When an appropriation is held in the name of an irrigation
24 district, a reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district,
25 a mutual irrigation company or canal company, or the United States Bureau
26 of Reclamation and the Chief Water Officer director determines that water
27 under that appropriation has not been used on a specific parcel of land
28 for more than five years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse
29 exists, the right to use water under that appropriation on that parcel
30 shall be terminated and notice of the termination shall be posted on the
31 department's website and shall be given in the manner provided in

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The district or company
2 holding such right shall have five years after the determination, or five
3 years after an order of cancellation issued by the Chief Water Officer
4 department following the filing of a voluntary relinquishment of the
5 water appropriation that has been signed by the landowner and the
6 appropriator of record, to assign the right to use that portion of the
7 appropriation to other land within the district or the area served by the
8 company, to file an application for a transfer in accordance with section
9 46-290, or to transfer the right in accordance with sections 46-2,127 to
10 46-2,129. The Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its order of
11 cancellation within sixty days after receipt of the voluntary
12 relinquishment unless the relinquishment is conditioned by the landowner
13 upon an action of a governmental agency. If the relinquishment contains
14 such a provision, the Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its
15 order of cancellation within sixty days after receipt of notification
16 that such action has been completed. The Chief Water Officer department
17 shall be notified of any such assignment within thirty days after such
18 assignment. If the district or company does not assign the right to use
19 that portion of the appropriation to other land, does not file an
20 application for a transfer within the five-year period, or does not
21 notify the Chief Water Officer department within thirty days after any
22 such assignment, that portion of the appropriation shall be canceled
23 without further proceedings by the Chief Water Officer department and the
24 district or company involved shall be so notified by the Chief Water
25 Officer department. During the time within which assignment of a portion
26 of an appropriation is pending, the allowable diversion rate for the
27 appropriation involved shall be reduced, as necessary, to avoid
28 inconsistency with the rate allowed by section 46-231 or with any greater
29 rate previously approved for such appropriation by the Chief Water
30 Officer director in accordance with section 46-229.06.
31 (6) When it is determined by the Chief Water Officer director that
-29-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 an appropriation, for which the location of use has been temporarily
2 transferred in accordance with sections 46-290 to 46-294, has not been
3 used at the new location for more than five years and that no sufficient
4 cause for such nonuse exists, the right to use that appropriation at the
5 temporary location of use shall be terminated. Notice of that termination
6 shall be posted on the department's website and shall be given in the
7 manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The
8 right to reinitiate use of that appropriation at the location of use
9 prior to the temporary transfer shall continue to exist for five years
10 after the Chief Water Officer's director's determination, but if such use
11 is not reinitiated at that location within such five-year period, the
12 appropriation shall be subject to cancellation in accordance with
13 sections 46-229 to 46-229.04.
14 (7) If at the time of a hearing conducted in accordance with
15 subsection (1) of this section there is an application for incidental or
16 intentional underground water storage pending before the Chief Water
17 Officer department and filed by the owner of the appropriation, the
18 proceedings shall be consolidated.
19 Sec. 81. Section 46-229.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:
21 46-229.05 An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Chief
22 Water Officer department upon such hearing as provided by section 61-207.
23 Sec. 82. Section 46-229.06, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-229.06 When a departmental proceeding that is conducted pursuant
26 to sections 46-229 to 46-229.04 concerns the partial cancellation of an
27 appropriation, the Chief Water Officer department may receive evidence on
28 the question of whether, following such partial cancellation, a reduction
29 in the rate of diversion to the maximum rate prescribed in section 46-231
30 would result in an authorized diversion rate less than the rate
31 necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of
-30-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 crops on the lands that remain subject to the appropriation. If the Chief
2 Water Officer director determines, based on a preponderance of the
3 evidence, that such rate would be less than the rate necessary, in the
4 interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops, he or she may
5 approve a diversion rate for the remaining portion of the appropriation
6 greater than the maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such
7 increased rate can be no greater than the rate authorized for the
8 appropriation prior to the partial cancellation and no greater than the
9 rate determined by the Chief Water Officer director to be necessary, in
10 the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands
11 that remain subject to the appropriation.
12 Sec. 83. Section 46-230, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
13 amended to read:
14 46-230 (1) As the adjudication of a stream progresses and as each
15 claim is finally adjudicated, the Chief Water Officer director shall make
16 and cause to be entered of record in his or her office an order
17 determining and establishing the priorities of right to use the water of
18 such stream, the amount of the appropriation of the persons claiming
19 water from such stream and the character of use for which each
20 appropriation is found to have been made, and the address of the owner of
21 each water appropriation.
22 (2) Whenever requested by the Chief Water Officer department, the
23 owner of any appropriation not held by an irrigation district,
24 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
25 irrigation or canal company shall provide the Chief Water Officer
26 department with the name, address, and telephone number of each then-
27 current owner of the appropriation and with the name, address, and
28 telephone number of any tenant or other person who is authorized by the
29 owner to receive opening and closing notices and other departmental
30 communications relating to the appropriation. Each appropriation owner
31 shall also notify the Chief Water Officer department any time there is a
-31-

1 change in any of such names, addresses, or telephone numbers. Notice of
2 ownership changes may be provided to the Chief Water Officer department
3 in the manner provided in section 76-2,124 or in any other manner
4 authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. If notice of an
5 ownership change is provided other than in accordance with such section,
6 the notice shall include such evidence of ownership as the Chief Water
7 Officer director may require. Notice of all other changes may be provided
8 in any manner authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. Upon
9 receipt of any new information, the Chief Water Officer department shall
10 update the Chief Water Officer's its records. The Chief Water Officer
11 department shall not collect a fee for the filing of any such information
12 or for updating the Chief Water Officer's its records.
13 Sec. 84. Section 46-231, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-231 Each appropriation shall be determined in its priority and
16 amount by the time at which it is made and the amount of water which the
17 works are constructed to carry. An appropriator shall at no time be
18 entitled to the use of more than he or she can beneficially use for the
19 purposes for which the appropriation has been made, and the amount of any
20 appropriation made by means of enlargement of the distributing works
21 shall be determined in like manner.
22 An allotment from the natural flow of streams for irrigation shall
23 not exceed one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of
24 land and shall not exceed three acre-feet in the aggregate during one
25 calendar year for each acre of land for which such appropriation has been
26 made, and an allotment shall not exceed the least amount of water that
27 experience may indicate is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry,
28 for the production of crops. Such limitations do not apply to storage
29 waters or to water appropriations transferred pursuant to sections
30 46-2,122 to 46-2,125 and 46-2,127 to 46-2,129.
31 When storage water is being used in addition to the natural flow,
-32-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 the person in charge of the ditch or canal shall, upon his or her request
2 and within twenty-four hours thereof, be notified in writing by the user
3 of such storage waters of the time of withdrawal from natural streams to
4 be distributed according to law.
5 When an appropriation is for irrigation purposes and the amount is
6 so small that a proper distribution and application is impractical, as
7 much water as the applicant can use without waste may be allotted for a
8 limited time so fixed by the Chief Water Officer department as to give
9 each appropriator his or her just share without violating other rights,
10 so long as (1) the volume of water used in a twenty-four-hour period does
11 not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been allowed at
12 the approved fixed continuous rate for a twenty-four-hour period or (2)
13 the volume of water used in a seven-day, Monday-through-Sunday period
14 does not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been
15 allowed at the approved fixed continuous rate for a seven-day period. The
16 Chief Water Officer department shall determine schedules among
17 appropriators to assure that other rights are not violated.
18 Sec. 85. Section 46-233, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 46-233 (1) The United States and every person intending to
21 appropriate any of the public waters of the State of Nebraska shall,
22 before (a) commencing the construction, enlargement, or extension of any
23 works for such purpose, (b) performing any work in connection with such
24 construction, enlargement, or extension, or (c) taking any water from any
25 constructed works, make an application to the Chief Water Officer
26 department for a permit to make such appropriation. A permit may be
27 obtained to appropriate public waters for intentional underground water
28 storage and recovery of such water. A public water supplier may make
29 application to appropriate public waters for induced ground water
30 recharge.
31 (2) The application shall be upon a form prescribed and furnished by
-33-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 the Chief Water Officer department without cost to an applicant. Such
2 application shall set forth (a) the name and post office address of the
3 applicant, (b) the source from which such appropriation shall be made,
4 (c) the amount of the appropriation desired, as nearly as it may be
5 estimated, (d) the location of any proposed work in connection with the
6 appropriation, (e) the estimated time required for its completion, which
7 estimated time shall include the period required for the construction of
8 ditches, pumps, and other features or devices, (f) the time estimated at
9 which the application of the water for the beneficial purposes shall be
10 made, which time shall be limited to a reasonable time following the
11 estimated time of completion of the work when prosecuted with diligence,
12 (g) the purpose for which water is to be applied and (i) if for induced
13 ground water recharge by a public water supplier, a statement of the
14 times of the year when and location along a stream where flows for
15 induced ground water recharge are proposed and (ii) if for irrigation, a
16 description of the land to be irrigated by the water and the amount, and
17 (h) such facts and supporting documentation as are required by the Chief
18 Water Officer department which shall include, but not be limited to, the
19 depth of all wells, the extent of the underlying aquifer, the expected
20 rate of recharge, the minimum flow or flows necessary to sustain the well
21 field throughout the reach identified, and the period of time that a well
22 field would continue to meet minimal essential needs of the public water
23 supplier when there is no flow as those factors relate to and are part of
24 an evaluation of pertinent hydrologic relationships.
25 A public water supplier making application for induced ground water
26 recharge may submit with its application a statement of the amount of
27 induced ground water recharge water which the public water supplier
28 presently uses as well as the amount of induced ground water recharge
29 water it anticipates using in the next twenty-five-year period. Such
30 statement shall also quantify the total amount of water the public water
31 supplier presently uses from the well field as well as the total amount
-34-

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 of water it anticipates using from the well field in the next twenty-
2 five-year period.
3 (3) Upon receipt of an application containing the information set
4 forth in this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall (a) make
5 a record of the receipt of the application, (b) cause the application to
6 be recorded in its office, and (c) make a careful examination of the
7 application to ascertain whether it sets forth all the facts necessary to
8 enable the Chief Water Officer department to determine the nature and
9 amount of the proposed appropriation. If such an examination shows the
10 application in any way defective, it shall be returned to the applicant
11 for correction, with a statement of the correction required, within
12 ninety days after its receipt. Ninety days shall be allowed for the
13 refiling of the application, and in default of such refiling, the
14 application shall stand dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (4)
15 of this section, if so filed and corrected as required within such time,
16 the application shall, upon being accepted and allowed, take priority as
17 of the date of the original filing, subject to compliance with the future
18 provisions of the law and the rules and regulations thereunder. During
19 the pendency of any application or upon its approval, the Chief Water
20 Officer department, upon proper authorization and request of the
21 applicant, may assign the application a later priority date.
22 (4) For public water supplier wells in existence on September 9,
23 1993, the priority date assigned to an application for induced ground
24 water recharge made by a public water supplier shall be:
25 (a) June 27, 1963, for water supply wells and facilities constructed
26 and placed in service on or before June 27, 1963;
27 (b) January 1, 1970, for water supply wells and facilities
28 constructed and placed in service on or after June 28, 1963, and on or
29 before December 31, 1969;
30 (c) January 1, 1980, for water supply wells and facilities

2 (d) January 1, 1990, for water supply wells and facilities
3 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1980, and on or
4 before December 31, 1989; and
5 (e) January 1, 1993, for water supply wells and facilities
6 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1990, and on or
7 before September 9, 1993.
8 (5) Prior to taking action on an application for induced ground
9 water recharge, the Chief Water Officer director shall publish notice of
10 such application at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
11 three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
12 of the stream segment and also in a newspaper of statewide circulation.
13 The notice shall state that any person having an interest may, in
14 writing, object to the application. Any such objection shall be filed
15 with the Chief Water Officer department within two weeks after the final
16 publication of the notice.
17 (6) After the Chief Water Officer director has accepted the
18 application made under subsection (2) of this section as a completed
19 application and published notice as required under subsection (5) of this
20 section, the Chief Water Officer director shall, if he or she determines
21 that a hearing is necessary, set a time and place for a public hearing on
22 the application. The hearing shall be held within reasonable proximity to
23 the area in which the wells are or would be located. At the hearing the
24 applicant shall present all hydrological data and other evidence
25 supporting its application. All interested parties shall be allowed to
26 testify and present evidence relative to the application.
27 (7) An unapproved application pending on August 26, 1983, may be
28 amended to include appropriation for intentional underground water
29 storage and recovery of such water.
30 (8) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer department
31 for a temporary permit to appropriate water. The same standards for
-36-

LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 granting a permanent appropriation shall apply for granting such
2 temporary permit except when the temporary permit is for road
3 construction or other public use construction and the amount of water
4 requested is less than ten acre-feet in total volume. For temporary
5 permits for public-use construction, the applicant shall include on the
6 application the location of the diversion, the location of use, a
7 description of the project, the amount of water requested, and the person
8 to contact. Temporary permits for public-use construction and for less
9 than ten acre-feet in total volume may be granted without any
10 determination of unappropriated water and shall be considered to be in
11 the public interest. The requirement of filing a map or plans with the
12 application for a temporary permit may be waived at the discretion of the
13 Chief Water Officer director. In granting a temporary permit, the Chief
14 Water Officer director shall specify a date on which the right to
15 appropriate water under the permit shall expire. Under no circumstances
16 shall such date be longer than one calendar year after the date the
17 temporary permit was granted. Temporary permits shall be administered
18 during times of shortage based on priority. The right to appropriate
19 water shall automatically terminate on the date specified by the Chief
20 Water Officer director on the temporary permit without further action by
21 the Chief Water Officer department.
22 (9) Water may be diverted from any stream, reservoir, or canal by
23 any fire department or emergency response services for the purpose of
24 extinguishing a fire in progress in an emergency without obtaining a
25 permit from the Chief Water Officer department. The installation of a dry
26 well for this purpose is allowed without the prior permission of the
27 Chief Water Officer department, but the Chief Water Officer department
28 shall be informed of any such installation, its location, and the party
29 responsible for its installation and maintenance within thirty days after
30 the installation.

6 (2) In determining whether to grant such application, the Chief
7 Water Officer director shall consider the following factors:
8 (a) Whether unappropriated water exists in the source of supply
9 named in the application;
10 (b) Whether such application and appropriation when perfected are
11 not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
12 (c) Whether denial of the application is demanded by the public
13 interest; and
14 (d) Whether the proposed use is a beneficial use of water.
15 (3) When determining whether denial of such application is demanded
16 by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall consider
17 the following factors:
18 (a) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
19 use;
20 (b) Any adverse economic, environmental, and other impacts of the
21 proposed use;

1 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
2 overall benefits to Nebraska are greater than the adverse impacts to
3 Nebraska. The Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying
4 an application shall specify the reasons for such action, including a
5 discussion of the required factors for consideration, and shall document
6 such decision by reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any
7 other sources used by the Chief Water Officer director in making the
8 decision.
9 Sec. 87. Section 46-234, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 46-234 If there is no unappropriated water in the source of supply
12 or if a prior appropriation has been perfected to water the same land to
13 be watered by the applicant, the Chief Water Officer department may
14 refuse such application. An application may also be refused (1) if
15 existing facilities other than those owned or operated by the applicant
16 are to be utilized and the applicant fails to show, by documentary
17 evidence, agreements with the owner and operator of the facilities to
18 allow the applicant to use such facilities or (2) when denial is demanded
19 by the public interest. The party making such application shall not
20 prosecute such work so long as such refusal continues in force. An
21 application for appropriation shall not be exclusive of any of the lands
22 included therein until the owner or owners of such land give consent to
23 the same in proper form duly acknowledged. No application made or canal
24 constructed, prior to the application of the water and the perfection of
25 an appropriation therefor or the filing of the consent, shall prevent
26 other applications from being allowed and other canals from being
27 constructed to irrigate the same lands or any of them. In case of an
28 application for an appropriation of water for the development of water
29 power, the Chief Water Officer department shall promptly act upon such
30 application and limit the time within which such appropriation shall be
31 perfected to the period within which the proposed power project can be

3 amended to read:
4 46-235 (1) For applications other than those to appropriate public
5 waters for induced ground water recharge, if there is unappropriated
6 water in the source of supply named in the application, if such
7 application and appropriation when perfected are not otherwise
8 detrimental to the public welfare, and if denial of the application is
9 not demanded by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer department
10 shall approve the application and shall make a record in its office and
11 return the application to the applicant, who shall on receipt thereof be
12 authorized to proceed with the work and to take such measures as may be
13 necessary to perfect such application into an appropriation. The priority
14 of such application and appropriation when perfected shall date from the
15 filing of the application with in the Chief Water Officer office of the
16 department, and the date of filing shall be regarded as the priority
17 number thereof. The Chief Water Officer department may, upon examination
18 of such application, approve it for a shorter period of time for
19 perfecting the proposed appropriation or for a smaller amount of water or
20 of land than applied for. The Chief Water Officer department may also
21 impose such other reasonable conditions as the Chief Water Officer it
22 deems appropriate to protect the public interest. An applicant aggrieved
23 by the action of the Chief Water Officer department shall, upon proper
24 showing, be granted a hearing before the Chief Water Officer department,
25 which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
26 procedure adopted by the Chief Water Officer department, and a full and
27 complete record shall be kept of all such proceedings. When a complete
28 record of the case has been made up, the Chief Water Officer department
29 shall render an opinion of facts and of law based upon the evidence
30 before the Chief Water Officer it.

1 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
2 service before September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief Water
3 Officer director if he or she finds that:
4 (i) The appropriation is necessary to maintain the well or wells for
5 the use or uses for which the appropriation has been requested;
6 (ii) The rate and timing of the flow is the amount reasonably
7 necessary to maintain the well or wells for the uses for which the
8 appropriation has been requested; and
9 (iii) The application is in the public interest and is not
10 detrimental to the public welfare. There shall be a rebuttable
11 presumption that wells which are the subject of an application pursuant
12 to subdivision (2)(a) of this section are in the public interest and are
13 not detrimental to the public welfare.
14 (b) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application for
15 a well or wells constructed before September 9, 1993, but may
16 specifically deny the applicant the right to request regulation of junior
17 appropriators if the Chief Water Officer director, at the time of
18 approval, finds that the well or wells, at the time of their
19 construction, were not located, designed, or constructed so as to take
20 reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the area to minimize the
21 frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced ground water
22 recharge. Thereafter a public water supplier holding an approved
23 application which has been denied the right to request regulation of
24 junior appropriators may petition the Chief Water Officer director for a
25 hearing to present evidence showing the Chief Water Officer director that
26 the well or wells have been modified, relocated, or reconstructed to take
27 reasonable advantage of the aquifer conditions in the area. If the Chief
28 Water Officer director determines that the well or wells have been so
29 modified, relocated, or reconstructed, the Chief Water Officer director
30 shall cause to be modified the approval of the application to allow for
31 the regulation of junior appropriators, subject to the restrictions or

6 (3) An application for an induced ground water recharge
7 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed or to be
8 constructed on or after September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief
9 Water Officer director if he or she makes the findings required by
10 subdivision (2)(a) of this section and further finds that:
11 (a) There is unappropriated water available for the appropriation;
12 and
13 (b) The well or wells involved have been or will be located and
14 constructed to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the
15 area to minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for
16 induced ground water recharge.
17 (4)(a) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application
18 filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section for a smaller amount of
19 water than requested by the applicant. The Chief Water Officer director
20 may also impose reasonable conditions on the manner and timing of the
21 appropriation which the Chief Water Officer director deems necessary to
22 protect the public interest. The Chief Water Officer director may grant
23 an appropriation for specific months of the year if so demanded by the
24 public interest. If the Chief Water Officer director approves the
25 application, he or she shall issue a written order, which written order
26 shall include the findings required by this section, the amount of the
27 appropriation, and any conditions or limitations imposed under this
28 section.

10 Sec. 89. Section 46-235.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-235.01 A public water supplier which has received an
13 appropriation for induced ground water recharge pursuant to section
14 46-235 may, from time to time and within twenty-five years after the
15 priority assigned pursuant to section 46-233, petition the Chief Water
16 Officer department for a hearing to present evidence showing that all or
17 part of the original projection for additional water needs specified
18 pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-233 corresponds with the actual
19 use. To the extent the public water supplier is making beneficial use of
20 all or a portion of the water projected in the original application, the
21 right to use such additional water shall vest and the priority date of
22 such anticipated water use shall date back to the priority date assigned
23 pursuant to section 46-233. A public water supplier may not request such
24 a hearing at intervals of less than five years for each approved
25 application.
26 Sec. 90. Section 46-235.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

1 prior to September 9, 1993, if and to the extent such injury resulted
2 from regulation of junior appropriators requested by the public water
3 supplier to provide water for any purpose other than domestic. Such
4 compensation shall not be required to a junior appropriator if the
5 regulation requested is to provide water for domestic purposes only. At
6 the time any junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected prior
7 to September 9, 1993, is regulated at the request of a public water
8 supplier, the Chief Water Officer department shall determine for each
9 such appropriator the extent to which the regulation is for domestic
10 purposes and the extent to which it is for other purposes.
11 (3) A cause of action for just compensation shall accrue at the time
12 a junior appropriator is regulated by the Chief Water Officer department.
13 Sec. 91. Section 46-235.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-235.03 Natural resources districts shall have the authority to
16 impose restrictions or controls on public water suppliers as specified in
17 the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act. Such
18 restrictions or controls may limit the withdrawal of ground water to a
19 greater degree or extent than is otherwise permitted or allowed by a
20 permit issued by the Chief Water Officer department.
21 Sec. 92. Section 46-235.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-235.04 (1) Induced ground water recharge appropriations shall be
24 administered in the same manner as prescribed by Chapter 46, article 2,
25 for other appropriations. Appropriations for induced ground water
26 recharge may be canceled and annulled as provided in sections 46-229.02
27 to 46-229.05.
28 (2) The Chief Water Officer department may approve the transfer of

LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 appropriation, to improve the well field's efficiency of operation with
2 respect to river flow. The transfers shall be approved if the Chief Water
3 Officer department finds that (a) the transfers would not increase the
4 quantity of induced ground water recharge under the original priority
5 date or application, (b) the amount of water withdrawn from water wells
6 under the original priority date or application would not increase, (c)
7 the quantity of streamflow needed to sustain well field operation under
8 the original priority date would decrease, (d) the transfer would not
9 impair the rights of other appropriators, and (e) the transfer is in the
10 public interest in the same manner as provided in section 46-235. The
11 Chief Water Officer department may assign multiple priority dates to a
12 single water well that replaces two or more water wells which are
13 abandoned. Replacement water wells installed pursuant to this subsection
14 must be installed within the same well field as the abandoned water well.
15 Notice shall be furnished and any hearing held as provided in sections

24 application for water power and before placing water to any beneficial
25 use, the applicant shall enter into a contract with the State of
26 Nebraska, through the Chief Water Officer department, for leasing the use
27 of all water so appropriated. Such lease shall be upon forms prepared by
28 the Chief Water Officer department, and the time of such lease shall not
29 run for a greater period than fifty years; and for the use of water for
30 power purposes the applicant shall pay into the state treasury on or
31 before January 1 each year fifteen dollars for each one hundred
-45-

1 horsepower for all water so appropriated. Upon application of the lessee
2 or its assigns, the Chief Water Officer department shall renew the lease
3 so as to continue it and the water appropriation in full force and effect
4 for an additional period of fifty years.
5 Upon the failure of the applicant to comply with any of the
6 provisions of such lease and the failure to pay any of such fees, the
7 Chief Water Officer department shall notify the lessee that the required
8 fees have not been paid to the Chief Water Officer department or that the
9 lessee is not otherwise in compliance with the provisions of the lease.
10 If the lessee has not come into compliance with all provisions of the
11 lease or has not paid to the Chief Water Officer department all required
12 fees within fifteen calendar days after the date of such notice, the
13 Chief Water Officer department shall issue an order denying the applicant
14 the right to divert or otherwise use the water appropriation for power
15 production. The Chief Water Officer department shall rescind the order
16 denying use of the water appropriation at such time as the lessee has
17 come into compliance with all provisions of the lease and has paid all
18 required fees to the Chief Water Officer department. If after forty-five
19 calendar days from the date of issuance of the order the lessee is not in
20 compliance with all provisions of the lease or required fees have not
21 been paid to the Chief Water Officer department, such lease and water
22 appropriation shall be canceled by the Chief Water Officer department.
23 Sec. 94. Section 46-237, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-237 (1) Within six months after approval and allowance of an
26 application other than an application to appropriate public waters for
27 induced ground water recharge, the applicant shall file with in the Chief
28 Water Officer office of the department a map or plat which shall conform
29 to the rules and regulations of the department as to material, size,
30 coloring, and scale. Such map or plat shall show the source from which
31 the proposed appropriation is to be taken and all proposed dams, dikes,

2 storing, conveying, or using water for any purpose whatsoever and their
3 true courses or positions in connection with the boundary lines and
4 corners of lands which they occupy. The lands to be irrigated shall be
5 identified in the manner prescribed by the department. No rights shall be
6 deemed to have been acquired until the provisions of this section have
7 been complied with. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section,
8 failure to so comply shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all
9 rights thereunder.
10 (2) For any appropriation with a priority date earlier than 1958 but
11 for which either the appropriator has failed to comply with the
12 requirements of subsection (1) of this section or a map or plat required
13 by such subsection has been lost or destroyed through no fault of the
14 appropriator, the lack of such compliance or of such map or plat shall
15 not be the basis for an a departmental adjudication or cancellation of
16 the appropriation by the Chief Water Officer and the appropriation shall
17 not be subject to legal challenge by any party on that basis.
18 (3) The Chief Water Officer department may notify any appropriator
19 subject to subsection (2) of this section of the need to file a map or
20 plat of lands under such appropriation. Unless the Chief Water Officer
21 department grants an extension for good cause shown, the appropriator
22 shall file the required map within three years after that notification
23 and such map shall conform to the rules and regulations of the Chief
24 Water Officer department as to material, size, coloring, and scale. If
25 the appropriator fails to comply, the Chief Water Officer department may
26 deny the appropriator the right to divert or withdraw water subject to
27 the appropriation until compliance has been achieved.
28 Sec. 95. Section 46-238, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

4 power plant and reservoir or reservoirs for storage in connection
5 therewith and shall vigorously, diligently, and uninterruptedly prosecute
6 such work to completion unless temporarily interrupted by some
7 unavoidable and natural cause. A failure to comply with this section
8 shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the
9 appropriation. The cost of promotion and engineering work shall not be
10 considered a part of the cost of construction, and the progress of the
11 construction work shall be such that one-tenth of the total work shall be
12 completed within one year from the date of approval of the application.

16 progress necessary to complete such work or works within the time
17 stipulated in the approval of such application, notwithstanding the
18 ordinary delays and casualties that must be expected and provided
19 against. A failure to carry on the construction of either an irrigation
20 project or a water power project as outlined in this section shall work a
21 forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the appropriation,
22 and the Chief Water Officer department shall cancel such appropriation.
23 The Chief Water Officer department shall have free access to all records,
24 books, and papers of any irrigation or water power company, shall have

19 the irrigation of land lying both upstream and downstream from a storage
20 reservoir or intentional underground water storage facility. Under an
21 approved application for a permit to appropriate water stored in a
22 reservoir or facility for use on land upstream from such reservoir or
23 facility, water may be diverted from the stream by the applicant and a
24 compensating amount of water shall be released from the reservoir or
25 facility for the use of downstream appropriators, but the rights of prior
26 appropriators shall not be adversely affected by such exchange of water.
27 (3) The owner of a storage reservoir shall have a preferred right to
28 make such application for a period of six months from the time limited
29 for the completion of such reservoir. The date of the expiration of such
30 period shall be endorsed upon the application when allowed. If an

26 46-289 The Legislature finds, recognizes, and declares that the
27 transfer of water to outside the boundaries of a river basin may have
28 impacts on the water and other resources in the basin and that such
29 impacts differ from those caused by uses of water within the same basin
30 in part because any unused water will not be returned to the stream from
31 which it is taken for further use in that river basin. The Legislature

1 therefor recognizes the need to delineate factors for consideration by
2 the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
3 Environment Director of Natural Resources when evaluating an application
4 made pursuant to section 46-233 which involves an interbasin transfer of
5 water in order to determine whether denial of such application is
6 demanded by the public interest. Those considerations shall include, but
7 not be limited to, the following factors:
8 (1) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
9 interbasin transfer and use;
10 (2) Any adverse impacts of the proposed interbasin transfer and use;
11 (3) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
12 water in the basin of origin;
13 (4) Any reasonably foreseeable future beneficial uses of the water
14 in the basin of origin;
15 (5) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of leaving the
16 water in the basin of origin for current or future beneficial uses;
17 (6) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
18 and
19 (7) Alternative sources of water available to the basin of origin
20 for future beneficial uses.
21 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
22 overall benefits to the state and the applicant's basin are greater than
23 or equal to the adverse impacts to the state and the basin of origin. The
24 Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying an application
25 shall specify the reasons for such action, including a discussion of the
26 required factors for consideration, and shall document such decision by
27 reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any other sources used by
28 the Chief Water Officer director in making the decision.

8 flow, storage, or storage-use appropriation to a purpose not at that time
9 permitted under the appropriation shall apply for approval of such
10 transfer or change to the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
11 Resources.
12 (b) The application for such approval shall contain (i) the number
13 assigned to such appropriation by the Chief Water Officer department,
14 (ii) the name and address of the present holder of the appropriation,
15 (iii) if applicable, the name and address of the person or entity to whom

7 or change is to be temporary in nature, the duration of the proposed
8 transfer or change, and (xiv) such other information as the Chief Water
9 Officer department by rule and regulation requires.
10 (2) If a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, a
11 copy of the proposed agreement between the current appropriator and the
12 person who is to be responsible for use of water under the appropriation
13 while the transfer or change is in effect shall be submitted at the same
14 time as the application.
15 (3) Regardless of whether a transfer or a change in the purpose of
16 use is involved, the following changes in type of appropriation, if found
17 by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
18 Environment Director of Natural Resources to be consistent with section
19 46-294, may be approved subject to the following:
20 (a) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use may be
21 changed to a natural-flow appropriation for aboveground reservoir storage
22 or for intentional underground water storage;
23 (b) A natural-flow appropriation for intentional underground water
24 storage may be changed to a natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-
25 stream use or for aboveground reservoir storage;
26 (c) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
27 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
28 storage may be changed to an instream appropriation subject to sections
29 46-2,107 to 46-2,119 if the Chief Water Officer director determines that
30 the resulting instream appropriation would be consistent with
31 subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of section 46-2,115;
-63-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 (d) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
2 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
3 storage may be changed to an appropriation for induced ground water
4 recharge if the Chief Water Officer director determines that the
5 resulting appropriation for induced ground water recharge would be
6 consistent with subdivisions (2)(a)(i) and (ii) of section 46-235;
7 (e) An appropriation for the manufacturing of hydropower at a
8 facility located on a natural stream channel may be permanently changed
9 in full to an instream basin-management appropriation to be held jointly
10 by the Game and Parks Commission and any natural resources district or
11 combination of natural resources districts. The beneficial use of such
12 change is to maintain the streamflow for fish, wildlife, and recreation
13 that was available from the manufacturing of hydropower prior to the
14 change. Such changed appropriation may also be utilized by the owners of
15 the appropriation to assist in the implementation of an approved
16 integrated management plan or plans developed pursuant to sections 46-714
17 to 46-718 for each natural resources district within the river basin. Any
18 such change under this section shall be subject to review under sections
19 46-229 to 46-229.06 to ensure that the beneficial uses of the change of
20 use are still being achieved; and
21 (f) The incidental underground water storage portion, whether or not
22 previously quantified, of a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation may
23 be separated from the direct-use portion of the appropriation and may be
24 changed to a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation for intentional
25 underground water storage at the same location if the historic
26 consumptive use of the direct-use portion of the appropriation is
27 transferred to another location or is terminated, but such a separation
28 and change may be approved only if, after the separation and change, (i)
29 the total permissible diversion under the appropriation will not
30 increase, (ii) the projected consequences of the separation and change
31 are consistent with the provisions of any integrated management plan

1 adopted in accordance with section 46-718 or 46-719 for the geographic
2 area involved, and (iii) if the location of the proposed intentional
3 underground water storage is in a river basin, subbasin, or reach
4 designated as overappropriated in accordance with section 46-713, the
5 integrated management plan for that river basin, subbasin, or reach has
6 gone into effect, and that plan requires that the amount of the
7 intentionally stored water that is consumed after the change will be no
8 greater than the amount of the incidentally stored water that was
9 consumed prior to the change. Approval of a separation and change
10 pursuant to this subdivision (f) shall not exempt any consumptive use
11 associated with the incidental recharge right from any reduction in water
12 use required by an integrated management plan for a river basin,
13 subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated in accordance with
14 section 46-713.
15 Whenever any change in type of appropriation is approved pursuant to
16 this subsection and as long as that change remains in effect, the
17 appropriation shall be subject to the statutes, rules, and regulations
18 that apply to the type of appropriation to which the change has been
19 made.
20 (4) The Legislature finds that induced ground water recharge
21 appropriations issued pursuant to sections 46-233 and 46-235 and instream
22 appropriations issued pursuant to section 46-2,115 are specific to the
23 location identified in the appropriation. Neither type of appropriation
24 shall be transferred to a different location, changed to a different type
25 of appropriation, or changed to permit a different purpose of use.
26 (5) In addition to any other purposes for which transfers and
27 changes may be approved, such transfers and changes may be approved if
28 the purpose is (a) to maintain or augment the flow in a specific stream
29 reach for any instream use that the Chief Water Officer department has
30 determined, through rules and regulations, to be a beneficial use or (b)
31 to increase the frequency that a diversion rate or rate of flow specified

1 in another valid appropriation is achieved.
2 For any transfer or change approved pursuant to subdivision (a) of
3 this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall be provided
4 with a report at least every five years while such transfer or change is
5 in effect. The purpose of such report shall be to indicate whether the
6 beneficial instream use for which the flow is maintained or augmented
7 continues to exist. If the report indicates that it does not or if no
8 report is filed within sixty days after the Chief Water Officer's
9 department's notice to the appropriator that the deadline for filing the
10 report has passed, the Chief Water Officer department may cancel the its
11 approval of the transfer or change and such appropriation shall revert to
12 the same location of use, type of appropriation, and purpose of use as
13 prior to such approval.
14 (6) A quantified or unquantified appropriation for incidental
15 underground water storage may be transferred to a new location along with
16 the direct-use appropriation with which it is recognized if the Chief
17 Water Officer director finds such transfer to be consistent with section
18 46-294 and determines that the geologic and other relevant conditions at
19 the new location are such that incidental underground water storage will
20 occur at the new location. The Chief Water Officer director may request
21 such information from the applicant as is needed to make such
22 determination and may modify any such quantified appropriation for
23 incidental underground water storage, if necessary, to reflect the
24 geologic and other conditions at the new location.
25 (7) Unless an incidental underground water storage appropriation is
26 changed as authorized by subdivision (3)(f) of this section or is
27 transferred as authorized by subsection (6) of this section or subsection
28 (1) of section 46-291, such appropriation shall be canceled or modified,
29 as appropriate, by the Chief Water Officer director to reflect any
30 reduction in water that will be stored underground as the result of a
31 transfer or change of the direct-use appropriation with which the
-66-

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 incidental underground water storage was recognized prior to the transfer
2 or change.
3 (8) Any appropriation for manufacturing of hydropower changed under
4 subdivision (3)(e) of this section shall maintain the priority date and
5 preference category of the original manufacturing appropriation and shall
6 be subject to condemnation and subordination pursuant to sections 70-668
7 and 70-669. Any person holding a subordination agreement that was
8 established prior to such change of appropriation shall be entitled to
9 enter into a new subordination agreement for terms consistent with the
10 original subordination agreement at no additional cost. Any person having
11 obtained a condemnation award that was established prior to such change
12 of appropriation shall be entitled to the same benefits created by such
13 award, and any obligations created by such award shall become the
14 obligations of the new owner of the appropriation changed under this
15 section.
16 Sec. 111. Section 46-291, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 46-291 (1) Upon receipt of an application filed under section 46-290
19 for a transfer in the location of use of an appropriation, the Chief
20 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall review it for
21 compliance with this subsection. The Chief Water Officer Director of
22 Natural Resources may approve the application without notice or hearing
23 if he or she determines that: (a) The appropriation is used and will
24 continue to be used exclusively for irrigation purposes; (b) the only
25 lands involved in the proposed transfer are (i) lands within the quarter
26 section of land to which the appropriation is appurtenant, (ii) lands
27 within such quarter section of land and one or more quarter sections of
28 land each of which is contiguous to the quarter section of land to which
29 the appropriation is appurtenant, or (iii) lands within the boundaries or
30 service area of and capable of service by the same irrigation district,
31 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual

1 irrigation or canal company; (c) after the transfer, the total number of
2 acres irrigated under the appropriation will be no greater than the
3 number of acres that could legally be irrigated under the appropriation
4 prior to the transfer; (d) all the land involved in the transfer is under
5 the same ownership or is within the same irrigation district, reclamation
6 district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or
7 canal company; (e) the transfer will not result in a change in the point
8 of diversion or the point of diversion will be changed but the change
9 meets the following requirements: (i) The new point of diversion is on
10 the same named stream, the same tributary, or the same river or creek as
11 the approved point of diversion; (ii) the proposed point of diversion
12 will not move above or below an existing diversion point owned by another
13 appropriator; and (iii) the proposed point of diversion will not move
14 above or below a tributary stream or a constructed river return or a
15 constructed drain; and (f) the transfer will not diminish the water
16 supply available for or otherwise adversely affect any other surface
17 water appropriator. If transfer of an appropriation with associated
18 incidental underground water storage is approved in accordance with this
19 subsection, the associated incidental underground water storage also may
20 be transferred pursuant to this subsection as long as such transfer would
21 continue to be consistent with the requirements of this subsection. If
22 necessary, the boundaries of the incidental underground water storage
23 area may be modified to reflect any change in the location of that
24 storage consistent with such a transfer. Transfers shall not be approved
25 pursuant to this subsection until the Chief Water Officer department has
26 adopted and promulgated rules and regulations establishing the criteria
27 the Chief Water Officer it will use to determine whether proposed
28 transfers are consistent with subdivision (1)(f) of this section.
29 (2) If after reviewing an application filed under section 46-290 the
30 Chief Water Officer director determines that it cannot be approved
31 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, he or she shall cause a

5 appropriation is proposed to be transferred may provide the Chief Water
6 Officer department with comments about the potential economic impacts of
7 the proposed transfer or change in such county. The filing of any such
8 comments by a county board shall not make the county a party in the
9 application process, but such comments shall be considered by the Chief
10 Water Officer director in determining pursuant to section 46-294 whether
11 the proposed transfer or change is in the public interest.
12 Sec. 112. Section 46-292, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
13 amended to read:

23 review each application subject to subsection (2) of section 46-291 to
24 determine whether the requirements of section 46-294 will be met if the
25 transfer or change is approved. The requirement of this subsection is not
26 altered when there are objectors who have become parties to the proposed
27 transfer or change, but if a hearing is called by the Chief Water Officer
28 Department of Natural Resources on the Chief Water Officer's its own
29 motion or as the result of a request therefor filed in accordance with
30 subsection (4) of section 46-291, any evidence considered by the Chief

1 the proposed transfer or change, alone or when combined with any new or
2 increased use of any other source of water at the original location or
3 within the same irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
4 and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company for the
5 original or other purposes, will not diminish the supply of water
6 available for or otherwise adversely affect any other water appropriator
7 and will not significantly adversely affect any riparian water user who
8 files an objection in writing pursuant to section 46-291;
9 (e) The quantity of water that is transferred for diversion or other
10 use at the new location will not exceed the historic consumptive use
11 under the appropriation or portion thereof being transferred, except that

13 if both the current use and the proposed use are for irrigation, the
14 number of acres to be irrigated will not increase after the transfer, and
15 the location of the diversion from the stream will not change or (ii) a
16 transfer or change in the purpose of use of a surface water irrigation
17 appropriation as provided for in subsection (3), (5), or (6) of section
18 46-290 if the transfer or change in purpose will not diminish the supply
19 of water available or otherwise adversely affect any other water
20 appropriator, adversely affect Nebraska's ability to meet its obligations
21 under a multistate agreement, or result in administration of the prior
22 appropriation system by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
23 Resources, which would not have otherwise occurred;
24 (f) The appropriation, prior to the transfer or change, is not
25 subject to termination or cancellation pursuant to sections 46-229 to
26 46-229.04;
27 (g) If a proposed transfer or change is of an appropriation that has
28 been used for irrigation and is in the name of an irrigation district,
29 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
30 irrigation or canal company or is dependent upon any such district's or
31 company's facilities for water delivery, such district or company has

1 approved the transfer or change;
2 (h) If the proposed transfer or change is of a storage-use
3 appropriation and if the owner of that appropriation is different from
4 the owner of the associated storage appropriation, the owner of the
5 storage appropriation has approved the transfer or change;
6 (i) If the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent, either
7 (i) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the transfer or
8 change is in the same preference category established by section 46-204
9 as the purpose for which the water is to be used after the transfer or
10 change or (ii) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the
11 transfer or change and the purpose for which the water is to be used
12 after the transfer or change are both purposes for which no preferences
13 are established by section 46-204;
14 (j) If the proposed transfer or change is to be temporary, it will
15 be for a duration of no less than one year and, except as provided in
16 section 46-294.02, no more than thirty years;

21 contract or agreement; and
22 (l) The proposed transfer or change is in the public interest. The
23 Chief Water Officer's director's considerations relative to the public
24 interest shall include, but not be limited to, (i) the economic, social,
25 and environmental impacts of the proposed transfer or change and (ii)
26 whether and under what conditions other sources of water are available
27 for the uses to be made of the appropriation after the proposed transfer
28 or change. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall
29 adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to govern the Chief Water
30 Officer's director's determination of whether a proposed transfer or

1 (2) The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed
2 transfer or change will comply with subdivisions (1)(a) through (l) of
3 this section, except that (a) the burden is on a riparian user to
4 demonstrate his or her riparian status and to demonstrate a significant
5 adverse effect on his or her use in order to prevent approval of an
6 application and (b) if both the current use and the proposed use after a
7 transfer are for irrigation, the number of acres to be irrigated will not
8 increase after the transfer, and the location of the diversion from the
9 stream will not change, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
10 transfer will be consistent with subdivision (1)(d) of this section.
11 (3) In approving an application, the Chief Water Officer director
12 may impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to protect the
13 public interest, to ensure consistency with any of the other criteria in
14 subsection (1) of this section, or to provide the Chief Water Officer
15 department with information needed to properly and efficiently administer
16 the appropriation while the transfer or change remains in effect. If
17 necessary to prevent diminution of supply for any other appropriator, the
18 conditions imposed by the Chief Water Officer director shall require that
19 historic return flows be maintained or replaced in quantity, timing, and
20 location. After approval of any such transfer or change, the
21 appropriation shall be subject to all water use restrictions and
22 requirements in effect at any new location of use and, if applicable, at
23 any new diversion location. An appropriation for which a transfer or
24 change has been approved shall retain the same priority date as that of
25 the original appropriation. If an approved transfer or change is
26 temporary, the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation
27 shall revert to the location of use, purpose of use, or type of
28 appropriation prior to the transfer or change.
29 (4) In approving an application for a transfer, the Chief Water
30 Officer director may also authorize the overlying of water appropriations
31 on the same lands, except that if any such overlying of appropriations

1 would result in either the authorized diversion rate or the authorized
2 aggregate annual quantity that could be diverted to be greater than is
3 otherwise permitted by section 46-231, the Chief Water Officer director
4 shall limit the total diversion rate or aggregate annual quantity for the
5 appropriations overlain to the rate or quantity that he or she determines
6 is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of
7 crops on the land involved. The Chief Water Officer director may also
8 authorize a greater number of acres to be irrigated if the amount and
9 rate of water approved under the original appropriation is not increased
10 by the change of location. An increase in the number of acres to be
11 irrigated shall be approved only if (a) such an increase will not
12 diminish the supply of water available to or otherwise adversely affect
13 another water appropriator or (b) the transfer would not adversely affect
14 the water supply for any river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been
15 designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined
16 to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 and (i) the number of
17 acres authorized under the appropriation when originally approved has not
18 been increased previously, (ii) the increase in the number of acres
19 irrigated will not exceed five percent of the number of acres being
20 irrigated under the permit before the proposed transfer or a total of ten
21 acres, whichever acreage is less, and (iii) all the use will be either on
22 the quarter section to which the appropriation was appurtenant before the
23 transfer or on an adjacent quarter section.
24 Sec. 115. Section 46-294.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
25 is amended to read:
26 46-294.01 Whenever a temporary transfer is approved in accordance
27 with sections 46-290 to 46-294, the applicant shall, within sixty days
28 after the order of approval of the Chief Water Officer Department of
29 Natural Resources, cause copies of the following to be filed with the
30 county clerk or register of deeds of the county in which the land subject
31 to the appropriation prior to the transfer is located: (1) The permit by

1 which the appropriation was established; (2) the agreement by which the
2 temporary transfer is to be effected; and (3) the order of the Chief
3 Water Officer Director of Natural Resources approving the temporary
4 transfer. Whenever renewal of a temporary transfer is approved pursuant
5 to section 46-294.02, the applicant shall, within sixty days after such
6 approval, cause a copy of the order of the Chief Water Officer director
7 approving such renewal to be filed with the county clerk or register of
8 deeds of such county. Such documents shall be indexed to the land subject
9 to the appropriation prior to the transfer. The applicant shall file with
10 the Chief Water Officer department, within ninety days after the Chief
11 Water Officer's department's order of approval, proof of filing with the
12 county clerk or register of deeds. Failure to file such proof of filing
13 within such ninety-day time period shall be grounds for the Chief Water
14 Officer director to negate any prior approval of the transfer or renewal.
15 Sec. 116. Section 46-294.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
16 is amended to read:
17 46-294.02 A temporary transfer or a change in the type or purpose of
18 use of an appropriation may be renewed or otherwise extended by the
19 parties thereto at any time following the midpoint of the transfer or
20 change term, but any such renewal or extension is subject to review and
21 approval pursuant to sections 46-290 to 46-294. No renewal or extension
22 shall cause the term of any such temporary transfer or change to exceed
23 thirty years in duration from the date the renewal or extension is
24 approved by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy,
25 and Environment Director of Natural Resources.
26 Sec. 117. Section 46-294.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,

4 different uses and that all appropriations should consider the possible
5 legal relationship between surface water and ground water. Thus the
6 Legislature finds that, since such issues have not been fully considered,
7 the director shall not grant any permit to appropriate water, except as
8 specified in subsection (2) of this section, before January 1, 1997, for
9 any application pending on or filed after June 2, 1995.
10 (2) The Chief Water Officer director may grant applications for (a)
11 appropriations for flood control or sediment control structures which
12 will not make or cause to be made any consumptive use of the impounded
13 water, (b) applications for temporary appropriations for public

4 appropriation. If no requests for hearing are received and if the Chief
5 Water Officer director is satisfied with the information provided by the
6 appropriator of record that the appropriation continues to be
7 beneficially used and is in the public interest, the Chief Water Officer
8 director shall issue an order stating such findings. If requested by any
9 interested person, or on his or her own motion based on the comments and
10 information filed, the Chief Water Officer director shall schedule a
11 hearing. If a hearing is held, the purpose of the hearing shall be to
12 receive evidence regarding whether the water appropriated under the

14 granted and whether the permit is still in the public interest. The
15 hearing shall proceed under the rebuttable presumption that the
16 appropriation continues to provide the beneficial uses for which the
17 permit was granted and that the appropriation is in the public interest.
18 After the hearing, the Chief Water Officer director may by order modify
19 or cancel, in whole or in part, the instream appropriation.

14 made to prevent the levels of ground water contaminants from becoming too
15 high and to reduce high levels sufficiently to eliminate health hazards;
16 (3) Agriculture has been very productive and should continue to be
17 an important industry to the State of Nebraska;
18 (4) Natural resources districts have the legal authority to regulate
19 certain activities and, as local entities, are the preferred regulators
20 of activities which may contribute to ground water contamination in both
21 urban and rural areas;
22 (5) The department is authorized Department of Environment and
23 Energy should be given authority to regulate sources of contamination
24 when necessary to prevent serious deterioration of ground water quality;
25 (6) The powers given to districts and the department Department of
26 Environment and Energy should be used to stabilize, reduce, and prevent
27 the increase or spread of ground water contamination; and
28 (7) There is a need to provide for the orderly management of ground
29 water quality in areas where available data, evidence, and other
30 information indicate that present or potential ground water conditions
31 require the designation of such areas as management areas.

2 a plan, the Chief Water Officer director shall transmit his or her
3 specific findings, conclusions, and reasons for approval or disapproval
4 to the district submitting the plan.
5 (2) If the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources
6 disapproves a ground water management plan, the district which submitted
7 the plan shall, in order to establish a management area, submit to the
8 Chief Water Officer director either the original or a revised plan with
9 an explanation of how the original or revised plan addresses the issues
10 raised by the Chief Water Officer director in his or her reasons for
11 disapproval. Once a district has submitted an explanation pursuant to
12 this section, such district may proceed to schedule a hearing pursuant to
13 section 46-712.
14 Sec. 211. Section 46-712, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 46-712 (1) A natural resources district may establish a ground water
17 management area in accordance with this section to accomplish any one or
18 more of the following objectives: (a) Protection of ground water
19 quantity; (b) protection of ground water quality; or (c) prevention or
20 resolution of conflicts between users of ground water and appropriators
21 of surface water, which ground water and surface water are hydrologically
22 connected.
23 (2) Prior to establishment by a district of a management area other
24 than a management area being established in accordance with section
25 46-718, the district's management plan shall have been approved by the
26 Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources or the district shall
27 have completed the requirements of subsection (2) of section 46-711. If
28 necessary to determine whether a management area should be designated,

1 (5) A district shall, prior to adopting or amending any rules or
2 regulations for a management area, consult with any holders of permits
3 for intentional or incidental underground water storage and recovery
4 issued pursuant to section 46-226.02, 46-233, 46-240, 46-241, 46-242, or
5 46-297.
6 (6) If a ground water management area has been adopted by a district
7 under this section that includes one or more controls authorized by
8 subdivision (1)(f) or (1)(m) of section 46-739, the district may request
9 that the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources to conduct
10 an evaluation to determine if an immediate stay should be placed on the
11 issuance of new surface water natural-flow appropriations in the area,
12 river basin, subbasin, or reach of the management area, and the Chief
13 Water Officer department may determine that the stay is in the public
14 interest. The stay may include provisions for exceptions to be granted
15 for beneficial uses as described in subsection (3) of section 46-714 or
16 for a project that provides hydrological benefit to the area of the stay
17 and may include provisions that the stay may be rescinded based on new or
18 additional information that may become available.
19 Sec. 212. Section 46-713, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:
21 46-713 (1)(a) By January 1 of each year beginning in 2006 and except
22 as otherwise provided in this section and section 46-720, the Chief Water
23 Officer Department of Natural Resources shall complete an evaluation of
24 the expected long-term availability of hydrologically connected water
25 supplies for both existing and new surface water uses and existing and
26 new ground water uses in each of the state's river basins and shall issue
27 a report that describes the results of the evaluation. For purposes of
28 the evaluation and the report, a river basin may be divided into two or
29 more subbasins or reaches. A river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an
30 integrated management plan has been or is being developed pursuant to
31 sections 46-715 to 46-717 or pursuant to section 46-719 shall not be

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 evaluated unless it is being reevaluated as provided in subsection (2) of
2 this section. For each river basin, subbasin, or reach evaluated, the
3 report shall describe (i) the nature and extent of use of both surface
4 water and ground water in each river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the
5 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department
6 preliminarily considers surface water and ground water to be
7 hydrologically connected and the criteria used for that determination,
8 and (iii) the extent to which the then-current uses affect available
9 near-term and long-term water supplies. River basins, subbasins, and
10 reaches designated as overappropriated in accordance with subsection (4)
11 of this section shall not be evaluated by the Chief Water Officer
12 department. The Chief Water Officer department is not required to perform
13 an annual evaluation for a river basin, subbasin, or reach during the
14 four years following a status change in such river basin, subbasin, or
15 reach under subsection (12) of section 46-714.
16 (b) Based on the information reviewed in the evaluation process, the
17 Chief Water Officer department shall arrive at a preliminary conclusion
18 for each river basin, subbasin, and reach evaluated as to whether such
19 river basin, subbasin, or reach presently is fully appropriated without
20 the initiation of additional uses. The Chief Water Officer department
21 shall also determine if and how such preliminary conclusion would change
22 if no additional legal constraints were imposed on future development of
23 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water and reasonable
24 projections are made about the extent and location of future development
25 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach.
26 (c) In addition to the conclusion about whether a river basin,
27 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
28 department shall include in the report, for informational purposes only,
29 a summary of relevant data provided by any interested party concerning
30 the social, economic, and environmental impacts of additional
31 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water uses on resources

1 that are dependent on streamflow or ground water levels but are not
2 protected by appropriations or regulations.
3 (d) In preparing the report, the Chief Water Officer department
4 shall rely on the best scientific data, information, and methodologies
5 readily available to ensure that the conclusions and results contained in
6 the report are reliable. In its report, the Chief Water Officer
7 department shall provide sufficient documentation to allow these data,
8 information, methodologies, and conclusions to be independently
9 replicated and assessed. Upon request by the Chief Water Officer
10 department, state agencies, natural resources districts, irrigation
11 districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation districts,
12 mutual irrigation companies, canal companies, municipalities, and other
13 water users and stakeholders shall provide relevant data and information
14 in their possession. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
15 Resources shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific
16 data and other information that will be considered for making the
17 preliminary determinations required by this section.
18 (2)(a) The Chief Water Officer department shall complete a
19 reevaluation of a river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated
20 management plan has been or is being prepared if the Chief Water Officer
21 department has reason to believe that a reevaluation might lead to a
22 different determination about whether such river basin, subbasin, or
23 reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated. A decision to reevaluate
24 may be reached by the Chief Water Officer department on its own or in
25 response to a petition filed with the Chief Water Officer department by
26 any interested person. To be considered sufficient to justify a
27 reevaluation, a petition shall be accompanied by supporting information
28 showing that (i) new scientific data or other information relevant to the
29 determination of whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
30 appropriated or overappropriated has become available since the last
31 evaluation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the Chief Water

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 Officer department relied on incorrect or incomplete information when the
2 river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated, or (iii) the Chief
3 Water Officer department erred in the its interpretation or application
4 of the information available when the river basin, subbasin, or reach was
5 last evaluated. If a petition determined by the Chief Water Officer
6 department to be sufficient is filed before July 1 of any year, the
7 reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved shall be
8 included in the next annual report prepared in accordance with subsection
9 (1) of this section. If any such petition is filed on or after July 1 of
10 any year, the Chief Water Officer department may defer the reevaluation
11 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved until the second annual
12 report after such filing.
13 (b) If the reevaluation results in a different determination by the
14 Chief Water Officer department, then (i) the Chief Water Officer
15 department shall notify, by certified mail, the affected natural
16 resources districts and any irrigation district, public power and
17 irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
18 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach of the preliminary change in the determination and
20 (ii) the Chief Water Officer department shall hold one or more public
21 hearings not more than ninety days after the publication of the notice
22 required in subdivision (b)(i) of this subsection. Notice of the hearings
23 shall be provided in the same manner as the notice required in subsection
24 (1) of section 46-714. Any interested person may appear at the hearing
25 and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
26 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
27 (c) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subdivision (b)
28 of this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
29 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
30 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
31 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.

1 (3) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed fully
2 appropriated if the Chief Water Officer department determines based upon
3 the its evaluation conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
4 and information presented at the hearing pursuant to subsection (4) of
5 section 46-714 that then-current uses of hydrologically connected surface
6 water and ground water in the river basin, subbasin, or reach cause or
7 will in the reasonably foreseeable future cause (a) the surface water
8 supply to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the beneficial or
9 useful purposes for which existing natural-flow or storage appropriations
10 were granted and the beneficial or useful purposes for which, at the time
11 of approval, any existing instream appropriation was granted, (b) the
12 streamflow to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the
13 beneficial uses from wells constructed in aquifers dependent on recharge
14 from the river or stream involved, or (c) reduction in the flow of a
15 river or stream sufficient to cause noncompliance by Nebraska with an
16 interstate compact or decree, other formal state contract or agreement,
17 or applicable state or federal laws.
18 (4)(a) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed
19 overappropriated if, on July 16, 2004, the river basin, subbasin, or
20 reach is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among three or
21 more states and if, prior to such date, the Chief Water Officer
22 department has declared a moratorium on the issuance of new surface water
23 appropriations in such river basin, subbasin, or reach and has requested
24 each natural resources district with jurisdiction in the affected area in
25 such river basin, subbasin, or reach either (i) to close or to continue
26 in effect a previously adopted closure of all or part of such river
27 basin, subbasin, or reach to the issuance of additional water well
28 permits in accordance with subdivision (1)(k) of section 46-656.25 as
29 such section existed prior to July 16, 2004, or (ii) to temporarily
30 suspend or to continue in effect a temporary suspension, previously

2 river basin, subbasin, or reach.
3 (b) Within sixty days after July 16, 2004, the Chief Water Officer
4 department shall designate which river basins, subbasins, or reaches are
5 overappropriated. The designation shall include a description of the
6 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department has
7 determined that surface water and ground water are hydrologically
8 connected and the criteria used to make such determination.
9 Sec. 213. Section 46-714, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 46-714 (1) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
12 Resources makes a preliminary determination that a river basin, subbasin,
13 or reach not previously designated as overappropriated and not previously
14 determined to be fully appropriated has become fully appropriated, the
15 Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate stay on the
16 issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations
17 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer
18 department shall also provide prompt notice of such preliminary
19 determination to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to
20 each natural resources district that encompasses any of the geographic
21 area involved. Such notice to natural resources districts shall be by
22 certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the manager of the
23 natural resources district or his or her designee and shall include the
24 signature of the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources.
25 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by the natural resources
26 district, there shall be a stay on issuance of water well construction
27 permits in the geographic area preliminarily determined by the Chief
28 Water Officer department to include hydrologically connected surface
29 water and ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief
30 Water Officer department shall also notify the public of the preliminary
31 determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
-157-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317

1 appropriated and of the affected geographic area. Such notice shall be
2 provided by publication once each week for three consecutive weeks in at
3 least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in such other newspaper
4 or newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
5 department to provide general circulation in the river basin, subbasin,
6 or reach.
7 (2) If the Chief Water Officer department preliminarily determines a
8 river basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated and has
9 identified the existence of hydrologically connected surface water and
10 ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach, stays shall also be
11 imposed:
12 (a) On the construction of any new water well in the area covered by
13 the determination unless a permit with conditions imposed by the natural
14 resources district has been issued prior to the determination. Such
15 conditions shall meet the objectives of subsection (4) of section 46-715
16 and may include, but are not limited to, conditions in accordance with
17 subsection (6) of section 46-739. Any well constructed pursuant to such
18 permit shall be completed in accordance with section 46-738; and
19 (b) On the use of an existing water well or an existing surface
20 water appropriation in the affected area to increase the number of acres
21 historically irrigated.
22 Such additional stays shall begin ten days after the first
23 publication, in a newspaper of statewide circulation, of the notice of
24 the preliminary determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is
25 fully appropriated.
26 (3) Exceptions to the stays imposed pursuant to subsection (1), (2),
27 (8), or (9) of this section shall exist for (a) test holes, (b)
28 dewatering wells with an intended use of one year or less, (c) monitoring
29 wells, (d) wells constructed pursuant to a ground water remediation plan
30 under the Environmental Protection Act, (e) water wells designed and

2 be connected or otherwise combined to serve a single project such that
3 the collective pumping would exceed fifty gallons per minute, (f) water
4 wells for range livestock, (g) new surface water uses or water wells that
5 are necessary to alleviate an emergency situation involving the provision
6 of water for human consumption or public health and safety, (h) water
7 wells defined by the applicable natural resources district as replacement
8 water wells, but the consumptive use of any such replacement water well
9 can be no greater than the historic consumptive use of the water well it
10 is to replace or, if applicable, the historic consumptive use of the
11 surface water use it is to replace, (i) new surface water uses and water
12 wells to which a right or permit is transferred in accordance with state
13 law, but the consumptive use of any such new use can be no greater than
14 the historic consumptive use of the surface water use or water well from
15 which the right or permit is being transferred, (j) water wells and
16 increases in ground water irrigated acres for which a variance is granted
17 by the applicable natural resources district for good cause shown, (k)

2 shown, and (o) water wells for which permits have been approved by the
3 Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the
4 Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act prior to
5 the effective date of the stay.
6 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any stay imposed
7 pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall remain in
8 effect for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach until the Chief
9 Water Officer department has made a final determination regarding whether
10 the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and, if the
11 Chief Water Officer's department's final determination is that the river
12 basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, shall remain in effect
13 as provided in subsection (11) of this section. Within the time period
14 between the dates of the preliminary and final determinations, the Chief
15 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
16 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public
17 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
18 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
20 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
21 resources districts. The Chief Water Officer department shall also hold
22 one or more public hearings not more than ninety days after the first
23 publication of the notice required by subsection (1) of this section.
24 Notice of the hearings shall be provided in the same manner as the notice
25 required by such subsection. Any interested person may appear at such
26 hearing and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
27 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Chief
28 Water Officer's department's preliminary conclusions about the extent of
29 the area within which the surface water and ground water supplies for the
30 river basin, subbasin, or reach are determined to be hydrologically
31 connected, and whether the stays on new uses should be terminated.

1 (5) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subsection (4)
2 of this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
3 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
4 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
5 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach. If the final determination is
6 that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief
7 Water Officer department, at the same time, shall (a) decide whether to
8 continue or to terminate the stays on new surface water uses and on
9 increases in the number of surface water irrigated acres and (b)
10 designate the geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer
11 department considers surface water and ground water to be hydrologically
12 connected in the river basin, subbasin, or reach and describe the methods
13 and criteria used in making that determination. The Chief Water Officer
14 department shall provide notice of its decision to continue or terminate
15 the stays in the same manner as the notice required by subsection (1) of
16 this section.
17 (6) Within ninety days after a final determination by the Chief
18 Water Officer department that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
19 appropriated, an affected natural resources district may hold one or more
20 public hearings on the question of whether the stays on the issuance of
21 new water well permits, on the construction of new water wells, or on
22 increases in ground water irrigated acres should be terminated. Notice of
23 the hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
24 (7) Within forty-five days after a natural resources district's
25 final hearing pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the natural
26 resources district shall decide (a) whether to terminate the stay on new
27 water wells in all or part of the natural resources district subject to
28 the stay and (b) whether to terminate the stay on increases in ground
29 water irrigated acres. If the natural resources district decides not to
30 terminate the stay on new water wells in any geographic area, it shall
31 also decide whether to exempt from such stay the construction of water

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 wells for which permits were issued prior to the issuance of the stay but
2 for which construction had not begun prior to issuance of the stay. If
3 construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior to the
4 stay is allowed, all permits that were valid when the stay went into
5 effect shall be extended by a time period equal to the length of the
6 stay.
7 (8) Whenever the Chief Water Officer department designates a river
8 basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, each previously declared
9 moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in the
10 river basin, subbasin, or reach shall continue in effect. The Chief Water
11 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of such designation
12 to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to each natural
13 resources district that encompasses any of the geographic area involved.
14 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by a natural resources district,
15 there shall be a stay on the issuance of new water well construction
16 permits in any portion of such natural resources district that is within
17 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
18 department. The Chief Water Officer department shall also notify the
19 public of its designation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach as
20 overappropriated and of the geographic area involved in such designation.
21 Such notice shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks
22 in at least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in such other
23 newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
24 department to provide general notice in the river basin, subbasin, or
25 reach.
26 (9) Beginning ten days after the first publication of notice under
27 subsection (8) of this section in a newspaper of statewide circulation,
28 there shall also be stays (a) on the construction of any new water well
29 in the hydrologically connected area if such construction has not
30 commenced prior to such date and if no permit for construction of the
31 water well has been issued previously by either the Chief Water Officer

1 department or the natural resources district, (b) on the use of an
2 existing water well in the hydrologically connected area to increase the
3 number of acres historically irrigated, and (c) on the use of an existing
4 surface water appropriation to increase the number of acres historically
5 irrigated in the affected area.
6 (10) Within ninety days after a designation by the Chief Water
7 Officer department of a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
8 overappropriated, a natural resources district that encompasses any of
9 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
10 department may hold one or more public hearings on the question of
11 whether to terminate the stays on (a) the construction of new water wells
12 within all or part of its portion of the hydrologically connected area,
13 (b) the issuance of new water well construction permits in such area, or
14 (c) the increase in ground water irrigated acres in such area. Notice of
15 any hearing for such purpose shall be provided pursuant to section
16 46-743. Prior to the scheduling of a natural resources district hearing
17 on the question of whether to terminate any such stay, the Chief Water
18 Officer department and the affected natural resources district shall
19 consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
20 and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
21 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
22 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
23 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
24 resources district.
25 (11) Any stay issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect
26 until (a) the stay has been terminated pursuant to subsection (5), (7),
27 or (10) of this section, (b) an integrated management plan for the
28 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Chief
29 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts and

1 Water Review Board and has taken effect, (d) the Chief Water Officer
2 department has completed a reevaluation pursuant to subsection (2) of
3 section 46-713 and has determined that the affected river basin,
4 subbasin, or reach is not fully appropriated or overappropriated, or (e)
5 the stay expires pursuant to this subsection. Such stay may be imposed
6 initially for not more than three years following the Chief Water
7 Officer's department's designation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach
8 as overappropriated or the Chief Water Officer's department's final
9 determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
10 appropriated and may be extended thereafter on an annual basis by
11 agreement of the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
12 resources district for not more than two additional years if necessary to
13 allow the development, adoption, and implementation of an integrated
14 management plan pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-719.
15 (12)(a) For purposes of this subsection, (i) a status change occurs
16 when a preliminary or final determination that a river basin, subbasin,
17 or reach is fully appropriated is reversed by the Chief Water Officer
18 department or by judicial determination and such river basin, subbasin,
19 or reach is determined not to be fully appropriated and (ii) the
20 hydrologically connected area means the geographic area within which the
21 Chief Water Officer department considers surface water and ground water
22 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach to be hydrologically connected.
23 (b) If a status change occurs, any stays previously in force by the
24 Chief Water Officer department or affected natural resources districts
25 shall remain in force until the stays imposed under this subsection are
26 in place and the Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate
27 stay on the issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use
28 appropriations in the river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water
29 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of the status change
30 in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. Immediately upon
31 receipt of the notice by the affected natural resources district, there
-164-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 shall be stays imposed as set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this
2 section, subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (3) of this
3 section. The stays imposed pursuant to this subsection shall remain in
4 effect within each affected natural resources district until such
5 district adopts rules and regulations in accordance with subdivision (c),
6 (d), or (e) of this subsection.
7 (c) Upon receipt of notice of a status change, each affected natural
8 resources district shall adopt rules and regulations within one hundred
9 twenty days after receipt of such notice for the prioritization and
10 granting of water well permits within the hydrologically connected area
11 for the four-year period following the status change. Nothing in this
12 subsection shall be construed to supersede the authority provided to
13 natural resources districts under subsection (2) of section 46-707 and
14 subdivisions (1)(f) and (1)(m) of section 46-739.
15 (d) The rules and regulations adopted by each affected natural
16 resources district in accordance with subdivision (c) of this subsection
17 shall (i) allow a limited number of total new ground water irrigated
18 acres annually, (ii) be created with the purpose of maintaining the
19 status of not fully appropriated based on the most recent basin
20 determination, (iii) be for a term of not less than four years, and (iv)
21 limit the number of new permits so that total new ground water irrigated
22 acres do not exceed the number set in the rules and regulations. The
23 Chief Water Officer department shall approve the proposed new number of
24 ground water irrigated acres within sixty days after approval by the
25 natural resources district if such district meets the conditions set
26 forth in subdivision (d)(ii) of this subsection, based on the most recent
27 basin determination.
28 (e) If the proposed new number of acres is not approved by the Chief
29 Water Officer department within the applicable time period as provided in
30 subdivision (d) of this subsection, the affected natural resources
31 districts shall adopt rules and regulations that allow water well permits

1 to be issued that will result in no more than two thousand five hundred
2 irrigated acres or that will result in an increase of not more than
3 twenty percent of all historically irrigated acres within the
4 hydrologically connected area of each natural resources district within
5 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, whichever is less, for each
6 calendar year of the four-year period following the date of the
7 determination described in this subsection. Each affected natural
8 resources district may, after the initial four-year period has expired,
9 annually determine whether water well permit limitations should continue
10 and may enforce such limitations.
11 (f) During the four-year period following the status change, the
12 Chief Water Officer department shall ensure that any new appropriation
13 granted will not cause the basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully
14 appropriated based on the most recent basin determination. The Chief
15 Water Officer department, pursuant to its rules and regulations adopted
16 and promulgated under the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection
17 Act, shall not issue new natural flow surface water appropriations for
18 irrigation, within the river basin, subbasin, or reach affected by the
19 status change, that will result in a net increase of more than eight
20 hundred thirty-four irrigated acres in each natural resources district
21 during each calendar year of the four-year period following the date of
22 the determination described in this subsection.
23 Sec. 214. Section 46-715, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-715 (1)(a) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
26 Resources has designated a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
27 overappropriated or has made a final determination that a river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the natural resources districts
29 encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach and the Chief Water
30 Officer department shall jointly develop an integrated management plan
31 for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The plan shall be completed,
-166-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 adopted, and take effect within three years after such designation or
2 final determination unless the Chief Water Officer department and the
3 natural resources districts jointly agree to an extension of not more
4 than two additional years.
5 (b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin,
6 subbasin, or reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or
7 has not been finally determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly
8 with the Chief Water Officer department, develop an integrated management
9 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach located within the
10 district. The district shall notify the Chief Water Officer department of
11 its intention to develop an integrated management plan which shall be
12 developed and adopted according to sections 46-715 to 46-717 and
13 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-718. The objective of an integrated
14 management plan under this subdivision is to manage such river basin,
15 subbasin, or reach to achieve and sustain a balance between water uses
16 and water supplies for the long term. If a district develops an
17 integrated management plan under this subdivision and the Chief Water
18 Officer department subsequently determines the affected river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
20 department and the affected natural resources district may amend the
21 integrated management plan.
22 (2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects of
23 existing and potential new water uses on existing surface water
24 appropriators and ground water users shall be considered. An integrated
25 management plan shall include the following: (a) Clear goals and
26 objectives with a purpose of sustaining a balance between water uses and
27 water supplies so that the economic viability, social and environmental
28 health, safety, and welfare of the river basin, subbasin, or reach can be
29 achieved and maintained for both the near term and the long term; (b) a
30 map clearly delineating the geographic area subject to the integrated
31 management plan; (c) one or more of the ground water controls authorized
-167-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant to section 46-739;
2 (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized for adoption by
3 the Chief Water Officer department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a
4 plan to gather and evaluate data, information, and methodologies that
5 could be used to implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase
6 understanding of the surface water and hydrologically connected ground
7 water system, and test the validity of the conclusions and information
8 upon which the integrated management plan is based. The plan may also
9 provide for utilization of any applicable incentive programs authorized
10 by law. Nothing in the integrated management plan for a fully
11 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach shall require a natural
12 resources district to regulate ground water uses in place at the time of
13 the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary determination that the
14 river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, unless such
15 regulation is necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of a basin-
16 wide plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a natural resources district
17 may voluntarily adopt such regulations. The applicable natural resources
18 district may decide to include all water users within the district
19 boundary in an integrated management plan.
20 (3) In order to provide a process for economic development
21 opportunities and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin,
22 or reach, the integrated management plan shall include clear and
23 transparent procedures to track depletions and gains to streamflows
24 resulting from new, retired, or other changes to uses within the river
25 basin, subbasin, or reach. The procedures shall:
26 (a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the best
27 available information, data, and science;
28 (b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized to
29 estimate depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes
30 location, amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to
31 new uses;
-168-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 (c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not have
2 more than a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground
3 water users;
4 (d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and the Chief
5 Water Officer department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share
6 information on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting
7 water use in the river basin, subbasin, or reach;
8 (e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available to
9 mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
10 interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use
11 management, and use retirement;
12 (f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans after
13 consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
14 districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts,
15 municipalities, other political subdivisions, and other water users to
16 make water available for offset to enhance and encourage economic
17 development opportunities and economic sustainability in the river basin,
18 subbasin, or reach; and
19 (g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses shall
20 take to apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.
21 Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment of an
22 integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.
23 (4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed for
24 adoption in the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1) of
25 this section shall, when considered together and with any applicable
26 incentive programs, (a) be consistent with the goals and objectives of
27 the plan, (b) be sufficient to ensure that the state will remain in
28 compliance with applicable state and federal laws and with any applicable
29 interstate water compact or decree or other formal state contract or
30 agreement pertaining to surface water or ground water use or supplies,
31 and (c) protect the ground water users whose water wells are dependent on
-169-

LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 recharge from the river or stream involved and the surface water
2 appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion caused by
3 surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a river
4 basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily
5 determined to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713,
6 after the date of such designation or preliminary determination.
7 (5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
8 overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more
9 natural resources districts, the Chief Water Officer department and the
10 affected natural resources districts shall jointly develop a basin-wide
11 plan for the area designated as overappropriated. Such plan shall be
12 developed using the consultation and collaboration process described in
13 subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be developed concurrently with
14 the development of the integrated management plan required pursuant to
15 subsections (1) through (4) of this section, and shall be designed to
16 achieve, in the incremental manner described in subdivision (d) of this
17 subsection, the goals and objectives described in subsection (2) of this
18 section. The basin-wide plan shall be adopted after hearings by the Chief
19 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
20 (b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
21 overappropriated and subject to this subsection, the Chief Water Officer
22 department and each natural resources district encompassing such river
23 basin, subbasin, or reach shall jointly develop an integrated management
24 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach pursuant to subsections (1)
25 through (4) of this section. Each integrated management plan for a river
26 basin, subbasin, or reach subject to this subsection shall be consistent
27 with any basin-wide plan developed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
28 subsection. Such integrated management plan shall be developed after
29 consultation and collaboration with irrigation districts, reclamation
30 districts, public power and irrigation districts, mutual irrigation
31 companies, canal companies, and municipalities that rely on water from

1 within the affected area and that, after being notified of the
2 commencement of the plan development process, indicate in writing their
3 desire to participate in such process. In addition, the Chief Water
4 Officer department or the affected natural resources districts may
5 include designated representatives of other stakeholders. If agreement is
6 reached by all parties involved in such consultation and collaboration
7 process, the Chief Water Officer department and each natural resources
8 district shall adopt the agreed-upon integrated management plan. If
9 agreement cannot be reached by all parties involved, the integrated
10 management plan shall be developed and adopted by the Chief Water Officer
11 department and the affected natural resources district pursuant to
12 sections 46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board
13 pursuant to section 46-719.
14 (c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
15 shall identify the overall difference between the current and fully
16 appropriated levels of development. Such determination shall take into
17 account cyclical supply, including drought, identify the portion of the
18 overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
19 development that is due to conservation measures, and identify the
20 portions of the overall difference between the current and fully
21 appropriated levels of development that are due to water use initiated
22 prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated on or after such date.
23 (d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
24 shall adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives
25 identified under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following
26 steps:
27 (i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact of
28 streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water
29 wells constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to
30 the extent those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1,
31 1997, and, unless an interstate cooperative agreement for such river
-171-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 basin, subbasin, or reach is no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow
2 depletions that would cause noncompliance by Nebraska with such
3 interstate cooperative agreement. During the first increment, the Chief
4 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
5 shall also pursue voluntary efforts, subject to the availability of
6 funds, to offset any increase in streamflow depletive effects that occur
7 after July 1, 1997, but are caused by ground water uses initiated prior
8 to such date. The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
9 resources districts may also use other appropriate and authorized
10 measures for such purpose;
11 (ii) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
12 resources districts may amend an integrated management plan subject to
13 this subsection (5) as necessary based on an annual review of the
14 progress being made toward achieving the goals for that increment;
15 (iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated
16 management plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten
17 years after the adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated
18 management plan pursuant to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the
19 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
20 district shall conduct a technical analysis of the actions taken in such
21 increment to determine the progress towards meeting the goals and
22 objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The
23 analysis shall include an examination of (A) available supplies and
24 changes in long-term availability, (B) the effects of conservation
25 practices and natural causes, including, but not limited to, drought, and
26 (C) the effects of the plan on reducing the overall difference between
27 the current and fully appropriated levels of development identified in
28 subdivision (5)(c) of this section. The analysis shall determine whether
29 a subsequent increment is necessary in the integrated management plan to
30 meet the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this
31 section and reduce the overall difference between the current and fully
-172-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of
2 this section;
3 (iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii) of this
4 subsection, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
5 resources districts, utilizing the consultative and collaborative process
6 described in subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall if necessary
7 identify goals for a subsequent increment of the integrated management
8 plan. Subsequent increments shall be completed, adopted, and take effect
9 not more than ten years after adoption of the previous increment; and
10 (v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii)
11 through (iv) of this subsection shall be repeated until the Chief Water
12 Officer department and the affected natural resources districts agree
13 that the goals and objectives identified pursuant to subsection (2) of
14 this section have been met and the overall difference between the current
15 and fully appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision
16 (5)(c) of this section has been addressed so that the river basin,
17 subbasin, or reach has returned to a fully appropriated condition.
18 (6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
19 fully appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure
20 that the state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a
21 formal state contract or agreement, the Chief Water Officer department,
22 in consultation with the affected districts, shall forecast on an annual
23 basis the maximum amount of water that may be available from streamflow
24 for beneficial use in the short term and long term in order to comply
25 with the requirement of subdivision (4)(b) of this section. This forecast
26 shall be made by January 1, 2008, and each January 1 thereafter.
27 Sec. 215. Section 46-716, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-716 (1) The surface water controls that may be included in an
30 integrated management plan and may be adopted by the Chief Water Officer
31 Department of Natural Resources are: (a) Increased monitoring and

1 enforcement of surface water diversion rates and amounts diverted
2 annually; (b) the prohibition or limitation of additional surface water
3 appropriations; (c) requirements for surface water appropriators to apply
4 or utilize reasonable conservation measures consistent with good
5 husbandry and other requirements of section 46-231 and consistent with
6 reasonable reliance by other surface water or ground water users on
7 return flows or on seepage to the aquifer; and (d) other reasonable
8 restrictions on surface water use which are consistent with the intent of
9 section 46-715 and the requirements of section 46-231.
10 (2) If during the development of the integrated management plan the
11 Chief Water Officer department determines that surface water
12 appropriators should be required to apply or utilize conservation
13 measures or that other reasonable restrictions on surface water use need
14 to be imposed, the Chief Water Officer's department's portion of the
15 integrated management plan shall allow the affected surface water
16 appropriators and surface water project sponsors a reasonable amount of
17 time, not to exceed one hundred eighty days unless extended by the Chief
18 Water Officer department, to identify the conservation measures to be
19 applied or utilized, to develop a schedule for such application and
20 utilization, and to comment on any other proposed restrictions.
21 Sec. 216. Section 46-717, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-717 (1) In developing an integrated management plan, the Chief
24 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources and the affected natural
25 resources districts shall utilize the best scientific data and other
26 information available and shall review and consider any rules and
27 regulations in effect in any existing ground water management area that
28 encompasses all or part of the geographic area to be encompassed by the
29 plan. Consideration shall be given to the applicable scientific data and
30 other information relied upon by the Chief Water Officer department in
31 preparing the annual report required by section 46-713 and to other types
-174-

LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 of data and information that may be deemed appropriate by the Chief Water
2 Officer department. The Chief Water Officer department, after seeking
3 input from the affected natural resources districts, shall specify by
4 rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other information
5 that will be considered in developing an integrated management plan. The
6 natural resources districts shall adopt similar rules and regulations
7 specifying the types of scientific data and other information necessary
8 for purposes of this section. Existing research, data, studies, or any
9 other relevant information which has been compiled by or is in possession
10 of other state or federal agencies, other natural resources districts,
11 and other political subdivisions within the State of Nebraska shall be
12 utilized. State agencies and political subdivisions shall furnish
13 information or data upon request of the Chief Water Officer department or
14 any affected natural resources district. Neither the Chief Water Officer
15 department nor the natural resources districts shall be required to
16 conduct new research or to develop new computer models to prepare an
17 integrated management plan, but such new research may be conducted or new
18 computer models developed within the limits of available funding if the
19 additional information is desired by the Chief Water Officer department
20 or the affected natural resources districts.
21 (2) During preparation of an integrated management plan for a fully
22 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach or of an integrated
23 management plan under subdivision (1)(b) of section 46-715, the Chief
24 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
25 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public
26 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
27 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
29 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or by the affected
30 natural resources districts. They shall also actively solicit public
31 comments and opinions through public meetings and other means.

1 Sec. 217. Section 46-718, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 46-718 (1) If the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
4 Resources and the affected natural resources districts preparing an
5 integrated management plan reach agreement on (a) the proposed goals and
6 objectives of the plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach,
7 (b) the proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (c) the
8 surface water and ground water controls and any incentive programs that
9 are proposed for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
10 subbasin, or reach, they shall schedule one or more public hearings to
11 take testimony on the proposed integrated management plan and the
12 proposed controls. Such hearings shall be held within forty-five days
13 after reaching agreement and within or in reasonable proximity to the
14 area to be affected by implementation of the integrated management plan.
15 Notice of such hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
16 The costs of publishing the notice shall be shared between the Chief
17 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
18 All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present testimony
19 or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being considered.
20 (2) Within sixty days after the final hearing under this section,
21 the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
22 districts shall jointly decide whether to implement the plan proposed,
23 with or without modifications, and whether to adopt and implement the
24 surface water and ground water controls and incentive programs proposed
25 in the plan. If the Chief Water Officer department and the natural
26 resources districts agree to implement the plan and to adopt and
27 implement the proposed controls, the natural resources districts shall by
28 order designate a ground water management area for integrated management
29 or, if the geographic area subject to the integrated management plan is
30 already in a ground water management area, the order shall designate an
31 integrated management subarea for that area. The order shall include a

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 geographic and stratigraphic definition of the ground water management
2 area or integrated management subarea and shall adopt the controls in the
3 integrated management plan that are authorized for adoption by the
4 natural resources district pursuant to section 46-739. The Chief Water
5 Officer department shall by order adopt the controls in the integrated
6 management plan that are authorized for adoption by the Chief Water
7 Officer department pursuant to section 46-716. Neither the controls
8 adopted by the district nor those adopted by the Chief Water Officer
9 department shall include controls substantially different from those set
10 forth in the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water
11 management area or an integrated management subarea by the natural
12 resources district shall not include any area that was not identified in
13 the notice of the hearing as within the area proposed to be subject to
14 the controls in the plan. The Chief Water Officer department and the
15 natural resources district shall each cause a copy of their respective
16 orders its order to be published in the manner provided in section
17 46-744.
18 (3) If at any time during the development of a basin-wide plan or an
19 integrated management plan either the Chief Water Officer department or
20 the affected natural resources districts conclude that the parties will
21 be unable to reach a timely agreement on the basin-wide plan or on (a)
22 the goals and objectives of the integrated management plan for the
23 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, (b) the geographic area to be
24 subject to controls, or (c) the surface water or ground water controls or
25 any incentive programs to be proposed for adoption and implementation in
26 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Governor shall be
27 notified and the dispute shall be submitted to the Interrelated Water
28 Review Board as provided in subsection (2) of section 46-719.
29 Sec. 218. Section 46-719, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

11 Nebraska Natural Resources Commission within twenty days after request by
12 the Governor for a list of nominees.
13 (b) Not more than two members of the board shall reside in the
14 geographic area involved in the dispute. A person is not eligible for
15 membership on the board if the decisions to be made by the board would or
16 could cause financial benefit or detriment to the person, a member of his
17 or her immediate family, or a business with which the person is
18 associated, unless such benefit or detriment is indistinguishable from
19 the effects of such action on the public generally or a broad segment of
20 the public. The board shall be subject to the Open Meetings Act.
21 (c) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, action
22 may be taken by a vote of three of the board's five members. For purposes

2 wide plans to the board. When the board has been convened to resolve
3 disputes over an integrated management plan, the Chief Water Officer
4 department and each affected natural resources district shall present
5 their (i) proposed goals and objectives for the integrated management
6 plan, (ii) proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (iii)
7 proposed surface water and ground water controls and any proposed
8 incentive program for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
9 subbasin, or reach involved. The Chief Water Officer department and each
10 affected natural resources district shall also be given adequate
11 opportunity to comment on the proposals made by the other parties to the
12 dispute.
13 (b) When the Interrelated Water Review Board concludes that the
14 issues in dispute have been fully presented and commented upon by the
15 parties to the dispute, which conclusion shall be made not more than
16 forty-five days after the board is convened, the board shall select the
17 proposals or portions of proposals that the board will consider for
18 adoption and shall schedule one or more public hearings to take testimony
19 on the selected proposals. The hearings shall be held within forty-five
20 days after the board's selection of proposals to consider for adoption
21 and shall be within or in reasonable proximity to the area that would be
22 affected by implementation of any of the proposals to be considered at
23 the hearings. Notice of the hearings shall be published as provided in
24 section 46-743. The cost of publishing the notice shall be shared by the
25 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
26 districts. All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present
27 testimony or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being
28 considered.
29 (c) Within forty-five days after the final hearing pursuant to
30 subdivision (b) of this subsection, the Interrelated Water Review Board
31 shall by order, as applicable, adopt a basin-wide plan or an integrated
-179-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 management plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and, in
2 the case of an integrated management plan, shall designate a ground water
3 management area for integrated management or an integrated management
4 subarea for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. An integrated
5 management plan shall be consistent with subsection (2) of section
6 46-715, and the surface water and ground water controls and any
7 applicable incentive programs adopted as part of that plan shall be
8 consistent with subsection (4) of section 46-715. The controls adopted by
9 the board shall not be substantially different from those described in
10 the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water management
11 area or an integrated management subarea shall not include any area that
12 was not identified in the notice of the hearing as within the area
13 proposed to be subject to the controls in the plan.
14 (d) The order adopted under this subsection shall be published in
15 the manner prescribed in section 46-744.
16 (e) Surface water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review
17 Board shall be implemented and enforced by the Chief Water Officer
18 department. Ground water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water
19 Review Board shall be implemented and enforced by the affected natural
20 resources districts.
21 (3) Whether an integrated management plan is adopted pursuant to
22 section 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board pursuant to
23 subsection (2) of this section, the Chief Water Officer department or a
24 natural resources district responsible in part for implementation and
25 enforcement of an integrated management plan may propose modification of
26 the goals or objectives of that plan, of the area subject to the plan, or
27 of the surface water controls, ground water controls, or incentive
28 programs adopted to implement the plan. The Chief Water Officer
29 department and the affected natural resources districts shall utilize the
30 procedures in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement
31 on and to adopt and implement proposed modifications. If agreement on
-180-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 such modifications cannot be achieved utilizing those procedures, either
2 the Chief Water Officer department or an affected natural resources
3 district may notify the Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water
4 Review Board shall be appointed and convened in accordance with
5 subsection (1) of this section to resolve the dispute and, if applicable,
6 to adopt any modifications utilizing the procedures in subsection (2) of
7 this section.
8 (4) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
9 resources districts may also raise objections concerning the
10 implementation or enforcement of previously adopted surface water or
11 ground water controls. The Chief Water Officer department and the
12 affected natural resources districts shall utilize the procedures in
13 sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement on such
14 implementation or enforcement issues. If agreement on such issues cannot
15 be achieved utilizing such procedures, either the Chief Water Officer
16 department or an affected natural resources district may notify the
17 Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
18 appointed and convened in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
19 After permitting each party to fully express the its reasons for the its
20 position taken by each party on the disputed issues, the board may either
21 take no action or conclude (a) that one or more parties needs to modify
22 the party's its approach to implementation or enforcement and direct that
23 such modifications take place or (b) that one or more parties either has
24 not made a good faith effort to implement or enforce the portion of the
25 plan or controls for which the party it is responsible or is unable to
26 fully implement and enforce such portion and that such party's
27 jurisdiction with respect to implementation and enforcement of the plan
28 and controls shall be terminated and reassigned to one or more of the
29 other parties responsible for implementation and enforcement. A decision
30 by the Interrelated Water Review Board to terminate and reassign
31 jurisdiction of any portion of the plan or controls shall take effect
-181-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 immediately upon that decision. Notice of such reassignment shall be
2 published at least once in one or more newspapers as necessary to provide
3 general circulation in the area affected by such reassignment.
4 (5) The board may be reconvened in accordance with subsection (1) of
5 this section at a later date upon request to the Governor by the party
6 for which jurisdiction for implementation and enforcement was terminated
7 if such party desires to have the party's its jurisdiction reinstated,
8 but no such request shall be honored until at least one year after the
9 termination and not more than once per year thereafter. The board may
10 reinstate jurisdiction to that party only upon a clear showing by such
11 party that the party it is willing and able to fully implement and
12 enforce the plan and any applicable controls. Notice that a party's
13 jurisdiction has been reinstated shall be provided in the same manner
14 that notice of the earlier termination was given.
15 Sec. 219. Section 46-720, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 46-720 (1) The Legislature finds that, prior to July 16, 2004,
18 actions were taken by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed
19 prior to July 1, 2025, and by one or more natural resources districts
20 pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed immediately prior
21 to July 16, 2004 such date, for the purpose of addressing circumstances
22 that are, after July 16, 2004 such date, to be addressed in accordance
23 with sections 46-713 to 46-719. It is the intent of the Legislature that
24 actions taken pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed
25 immediately prior to July 16, 2004, should not be negated and that
26 transition from the authorities and responsibilities granted by such
27 section to those granted by sections 46-713 to 46-719 should occur in as
28 efficient a manner as possible. Such transition shall be therefor
29 governed by subsections (2) through (5) of this section, and all
30 references in such subsections to section 46-656.28 shall be construed to
31 mean section 46-656.28 as such section existed immediately prior to July

1 16, 2004.
2 (2) If, prior to July 16, 2004, (a) a natural resources district
3 requested pursuant to subsection (1) of section 46-656.28 that affected
4 appropriators, affected surface water project sponsors, and the
5 department consult and that studies and a hearing be held but (b) the
6 Director of Natural Resources, as such position existed, had has not made
7 a preliminary determination relative to that request pursuant to
8 subsection (2) of section 46-656.28, no further action on the district's
9 request shall be required of the department. If under the same
10 circumstances a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain water
11 wells has been imposed by the district pursuant to subsection (16) of
12 section 46-656.28 and remains in effect immediately prior to July 16,
13 2004, such temporary suspension shall remain in effect for thirty days
14 after the department issues its first annual report under section 46-713,
15 except that (i) such temporary suspension shall not apply to water wells
16 for which a permit has been obtained pursuant to the Municipal and Rural
17 Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act and (ii) to the extent any
18 such temporary suspension is in effect for all or part of a
19 hydrologically connected area for a river basin, subbasin, or reach
20 designated as overappropriated by the department, such temporary
21 suspension shall remain in effect only until it is superseded by the
22 stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section 46-714. To
23 the extent that any such temporary suspension applies to a geographic
24 area preliminarily considered by the department to have ground water
25 hydrologically connected to the surface water of a fully appropriated
26 river basin, subbasin, or reach, such temporary suspension shall be
27 superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of
28 section 46-714.
29 (3)(a) If prior to July 16, 2004, (i) the director has made a
30 preliminary determination pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28
31 that there is reason to believe that the use of hydrologically connected
-183-

AM711 AM711
LB317 LB317
JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 ground water and surface water in a specific geographic area is
2 contributing to or is in the reasonably foreseeable future likely to
3 contribute to any conflict, dispute, or difficulty listed in such
4 subsection, (ii) the director has not made a determination pursuant to
5 subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint action plan should not
6 be prepared, and (iii) preparation of a joint action plan pursuant to
7 subsections (5) through (9) of such section has not been completed, the
8 geographic area involved shall become subject to sections 46-713 to
9 46-719 on July 16, 2004, and the department need not evaluate such
10 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
11 46-713.
12 (b) For purposes of this subsection and section 46-714 and except as
13 otherwise provided in this section, (i) July 16, 2004, shall result in
14 the imposition in any geographic area subject to this subsection of the
15 stays required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714, (ii) such
16 stays shall be imposed in the manner required by such section, and (iii)
17 July 16, 2004, shall be treated as if it were the date of a departmental
18 preliminary determination pursuant to section 46-713 that such area is a
19 geographic area within which ground water and surface water of a fully
20 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach are hydrologically
21 connected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if a
22 temporary suspension in the drilling of certain new water wells has
23 previously been imposed by the affected natural resources district, (A)
24 the stays on construction of new water wells and on the increase in
25 ground water irrigated acres shall be limited in geographic extent to
26 only that part of the affected area within which the temporary suspension
27 was in effect unless the director determines that inclusion of additional
28 area is necessary because ground water and surface water are
29 hydrologically connected in such additional area and (B) the stays on
30 construction of certain new water wells shall not apply to a water well
31 constructed in accordance with the terms of a water well construction

1 permit approved by the district prior to July 16, 2004, unless such well
2 was subject to the district's temporary suspension. If, prior to July 16,
3 2004, the director has held a hearing on a report issued pursuant to
4 subsection (3) of section 46-656.28 but has not yet determined whether a
5 joint action plan should be prepared, no departmental hearing shall be
6 required pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 before a final
7 determination is made about whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach
8 involved is fully appropriated. If, prior to July 16, 2004, the director
9 has determined pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a
10 joint action plan should be prepared, such determination shall have the
11 same effect as a final departmental determination pursuant to subsection
12 (5) of section 46-714 that the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach
13 is fully appropriated and no separate determination to that effect shall
14 be required. If, after July 16, 2004, the department determines that all
15 or part of the area subject to this subsection is in an overappropriated
16 river basin, subbasin, or reach, that portion of the area shall
17 thereafter be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Ground Water
18 Management and Protection Act applicable to an overappropriated river
19 basin, subbasin, or reach and stays that have previously taken effect in
20 accordance with this subsection shall continue in effect as stays for an
21 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach without additional
22 action or publication of notice by the department. Any temporary
23 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells that has been imposed
24 in the geographic area involved by a natural resources district pursuant
25 to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28 prior to July 16, 2004, shall
26 remain in effect until superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to
27 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714.
28 (4) If, prior to July 16, 2004, preparation of a joint action plan
29 has been completed pursuant to subsections (5) through (9) of section
30 46-656.28 but the plan has not yet been adopted pursuant to subsection
31 (11) of such section, the department need not evaluate the affected

JNH - 03/18/2025 JNH - 03/18/2025
1 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
2 46-713. The department and the affected natural resources district shall
3 review the completed joint action plan for its compliance with sections
4 46-715 to 46-717. If the joint action plan is determined to be in
5 compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 or if agreement is reached on
6 the revisions necessary to bring it into such compliance, the department
7 and the district shall adopt the plan and implement the controls as
8 provided in section 46-718. If the joint action plan is determined not to
9 be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 and agreement on the
10 proposed plan or the proposed controls cannot be reached pursuant to
11 section 46-718, section 46-719 shall apply. Except to the extent that any
12 portion of the affected area is designated as all or part of an

1 wells constructed after January 1, 2001, if such litigation was commenced
2 before or on May 22, 2001. If such litigation is commenced after May 22,
3 2001, the district may establish different provisions for restriction of
4 water wells constructed after the date on which such litigation is
5 commenced in federal court. An appeal from a decision of the district
6 under this subdivision shall be in accordance with the hearing procedures
7 established in the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act.
8 (d) Except as otherwise authorized by law, the district shall make a
9 replacement water well as defined in section 46-602, or as further
10 defined in district rules and regulations, subject to the same provisions
11 as the water well it replaces.
12 (7) If the district has included controls delineated in subdivision
13 (1)(m) of this section in its management plan, but has not implemented
14 such controls within two years after the initial public hearing on the
15 controls, the district shall hold a public hearing, as provided in
16 section 46-712, regarding the controls before implementing them.
17 (8) In addition to the controls listed in subsection (1) of this
18 section, a district in which a management area has been designated may
19 also adopt and implement one or more of the following measures if it
20 determines that any such measures would help the district and water users
21 achieve the goals and objectives of the management area: (a) It may
22 sponsor nonmandatory educational programs; and (b) it may establish and
23 implement financial or other incentive programs. As a condition for
24 participation in an incentive program, the district may require water
25 users or landowners to enter into and perform such agreements or
26 covenants concerning the use of land or water as are necessary to produce
27 the benefits for which the incentive program is established and shall
28 further condition participation upon satisfaction of the requirements of
