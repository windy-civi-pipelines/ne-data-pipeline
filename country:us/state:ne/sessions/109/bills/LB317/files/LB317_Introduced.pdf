3 Sec. 28. Section 2-3254, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 2-3254 (1) The board shall hold a hearing upon the question of the
6 desirability and necessity, in the interest of the public health, safety,
7 and welfare, of the establishment of or altering the boundaries of an
8 existing improvement project area and the undertaking of such a project,
9 upon the question of the appropriate boundaries describing affected land,
10 upon the propriety of the petition, and upon all relevant questions
11 regarding such inquiries. When a hearing has been initiated by petition,
12 such hearing shall be held within one hundred twenty days of the filing
13 of such petition. Notice of such hearing shall be published prior thereto
14 once each week for three consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper published
15 or of general circulation in the district. Landowners within the limits
16 of the territory described in the petition and all other interested
17 parties, including any appropriate agencies of state or federal
18 government, shall have the right to be heard. If the board finds, after
19 consultation with such appropriate agencies of state and federal
20 government and after the hearing, that the project conforms with all
21 applicable law and with the district's goals, criteria, and policies, it
22 shall enter its findings in the board's official records and shall, with
23 the aid of such engineers, surveyors, and other assistants as it may have
24 chosen, establish an improvement project area or alter the boundaries of
25 an existing improvement project area, proceed to make detailed plans and
26 cost estimates, determine the total benefits, and carry out the project
27 as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. If the board
28 finds that the project does not so conform, the findings shall be entered
29 in the board's records and copies of such findings shall be furnished to
30 the petitioners and the commission.
31 (2) When any such special project would result in the provision of
-39-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall, prior to
2 commencement of construction of such project, determine, by circulation
3 of petitions or by some other appropriate method, if such project can be
4 reasonably expected to generate sufficient revenue to recover the
5 reimbursable costs thereof. If it is determined that the project cannot
6 be reasonably expected to generate sufficient revenue, the project and
7 all work in connection therewith shall be suspended. If it is determined
8 that the project can be reasonably expected to generate sufficient
9 revenue, the board shall divide the total benefits of the project as
10 provided in sections 2-3252 to 2-3254. If the proposed project involves
11 the supply of water for any beneficial use, including a public water
12 system as defined in section 71-5301, all plans and specifications for
13 the project shall be filed with the secretary of the district and the
14 Director of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources, except that
15 if such project involves a public water system as defined in section
16 71-5301, the filing of the information shall be with the Department of
17 Environment and Energy rather than the Director of Natural Resources. No
18 construction of any such special project shall begin until the plans and
19 specifications for such improvement have been approved by the Chief Water
20 Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment. When such a
21 special project involves a public water system as defined in section
22 71-5301, the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment shall Director of
23 Natural Resources and the Department of Environment and Energy, if
24 applicable, except that if such special project involves a public water
25 system as defined in section 71-5301, only the Department of Environment
26 and Energy shall be required to review such plans and specifications and
27 approve the same if in compliance with the Nebraska Safe Drinking Water
28 Act and departmental rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under
29 the act. All prescribed conditions having been complied with, each
30 landowner within the improvement project area shall, within any limits
31 otherwise prescribed by law, subscribe to a number of benefit units in
-40-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 proportion to the extent he or she desires to participate in the benefits
2 of the special project. As long as the capacity of the district's
3 facilities permit, participating landowners may subscribe to additional
4 units, within any limits otherwise prescribed by law, upon payment of a
5 unit fee for each such unit. The unit fees made and charged pursuant to
6 this section shall be levied and fixed by rules and regulations of the
7 district. The service provided may be withheld during the time such
8 charges levied upon such parcel of land are delinquent and unpaid. Such
9 charges shall be cumulative, and the service provided by the project may
10 be withheld until all delinquent charges for the operation and
11 maintenance of such works of improvement are paid for past years as well
12 as for the current year. All such charges, due and delinquent according
13 to the rules and regulations of such district and unpaid on June 1 after
14 becoming due and delinquent, may be certified by the governing authority
15 of such district to the county clerk of such county in which are situated
16 the lands against which such charges have been levied, and when so
17 certified such charges shall be entered upon the tax list and spread upon
18 the tax roll the same as other special assessment taxes are levied and
19 assessed upon real estate, shall become a lien upon such real estate
20 along with other real estate taxes, and shall be collectible at the same
21 time, in the same manner, and in the same proceeding as other real estate
22 taxes are levied.
23 (3) When the special project would not result in the provision of
24 revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall apportion the
25 benefits thereof accruing to the several tracts of land within the
26 district which will be benefited thereby, on a system of units. The land
27 least benefited shall be apportioned one unit of assessment, and each
28 tract receiving a greater benefit shall be apportioned a greater number
29 of units or fraction thereof, according to the benefits received. Nothing
30 contained in this section shall prevent the district from establishing
31 separate areas within the improvement project area so as to permit future
-41-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 allocation of costs for particular portions of the work to specific
2 subareas. This subarea method of allocation shall not be used in any
3 improvement project area which has heretofore made a final apportionment
4 of units of benefits and shall not thereafter be changed except by
5 compliance with the procedure prescribed in this section.
6 (4) A notice shall be inserted for at least one week in a newspaper
7 published or of general circulation in the improvement project area
8 stating the time when and the place where the directors shall meet for
9 the purpose of hearing all parties interested in the apportionment of
10 benefits by reason of the improvement, at which time and place such
11 parties may appear in person or by counsel or may file written objections
12 thereto. The directors shall then proceed to hear and consider the same
13 and shall make the apportionments fair and just according to benefits
14 received from the improvement. The directors, having completed the
15 apportionment of benefits, shall make a detailed report of the same and
16 file such report with the county clerk. The board of directors shall
17 include in such report a statement of the actual expenses incurred by the
18 district to that time which relate to the proposed project and the actual
19 cost per benefit unit thereof. Thereupon the board of directors shall
20 cause to be published, once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
21 newspaper published or of general circulation in the improvement project
22 area, a notice that the report required in this subsection has been filed
23 and notice shall also be sent to each party appearing to have a direct
24 legal interest in such apportionment, which notice shall include the
25 description of the lands in which each party notified appears to have
26 such interest, the units of benefit assigned to such lands, the amount of
27 actual costs assessable to date to such lands, and the estimated total
28 costs of the project assessable to such lands upon completion thereof, as
29 provided by sections 25-520.01 to 25-520.03. If the owners of record
30 title representing more than fifty percent of the estimated total
31 assessments file with the board within thirty days of the final

1 publication of such notice written objections to the project proposed,
2 such project and work in connection therewith shall be suspended, such
3 project shall not be done in such project area, and all expenses relating
4 to such project incurred by and accrued to the district may, at the
5 direction of the board of directors, be assessed upon the lands which
6 were to have been benefited by the completion of such improvement project
7 in accordance with the apportionment of benefits determined and
8 procedures established in this section. Upon completing the establishment
9 of an improvement project area or altering the boundaries of an existing
10 improvement project area as provided in this subsection and upon
11 determining the reimbursable cost of the project and the period of time
12 over which such cost shall be assessed, the board of directors shall
13 determine the amount of money necessary to raise each year by special
14 assessment within such improvement project area and apportion the same in
15 dollars and cents to each tract benefited according to the apportionment
16 of benefits as determined by this section. The board of directors shall
17 also, from time to time as it deems necessary, order an additional
18 assessment upon the lands and property benefited by the project, using
19 the original apportionment of benefits as a basis to ascertain the
20 assessment to each tract of land benefited, to carry out a reasonable
21 program of operation and maintenance upon the construction or capital
22 improvements involved in such project. The chairperson and secretary
23 shall thereupon return lists of such tracts with the amounts chargeable
24 to each of the county clerks of each county in which assessed lands are
25 located, who shall place the same on duplicate tax lists against the
26 lands and lots so assessed. Such assessments shall be collected and
27 accounted for by the county treasurer at the same time as general real
28 estate taxes, and such assessments shall be and remain a perpetual lien
29 against such real estate until paid. All provisions of law for the sale,
30 redemption, and foreclosure in ordinary tax matters shall apply to such
31 special assessments.

6 accorded a thirty-day period for review and comment. Failure to reply
7 within thirty days shall be conclusive that the plans have been endorsed
8 by the reviewing agency. All comments on plans shall be reviewed by the
9 district and alterations of the plans may be made as the district deems
10 appropriate. If any state agency comments indicate a lack of conformance
11 with the goals, criteria, and policies of any outdoor recreation plan,
12 any fish and wildlife plan, or indicate a conflict with state policies or
13 plans approved by the Legislature, such plans shall be altered as deemed

31 (b) Within a reasonable time after any federal listing, downlisting,
-67-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 removal, or uplisting, the commission may determine that any species of
2 wildlife or wild plant should receive a different state-listed status
3 throughout all or any portion of the range of such species within this
4 state by completing the formal listing process as prescribed in this
5 section or by retaining its previous state-listed status.
6 (2) In addition to the species determined to be endangered or
7 threatened pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, the commission shall,
8 by adopting and promulgating rules and regulations, determine whether any
9 species of wildlife or wild plants normally occurring within this state
10 is an endangered or threatened species as a result of any of the
11 following factors:
12 (a) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or
13 curtailment of its habitat or range;

5 portion of the district. Such election shall not subject the district to
6 liability under section 46-160 and shall not affect the rights of
7 landowners in that portion of the district to water deliveries in the
8 future. Any election to not deliver water to a portion of the district
9 shall be made on a year-to-year basis, not to exceed ten years, and such
10 election shall not subject any landowner to adjudication of his or her
11 water right under section 46-229. The board may adjust the tolls or

20 settlement, payment, and redemption, if possible, of all outstanding
21 bonded and other indebtedness of the district, but shall in no case pay
22 more than the market value of such outstanding bonds with interest up to
23 the time of payment. In cases when bonds not yet due cannot be redeemed
24 by reason of the refusal of the owner thereof to surrender them before
25 due, the board may invest the surplus money of the district, after paying
26 all debts that can be paid, in state, county, or other safe bonds,
27 bearing the same or greater rate of interest, if possible, than the
28 district bonds thus outstanding, for the purpose of paying such
29 outstanding bonds of the district when due. In case the amount realized
30 from the sale of such district property, together with other money of the
31 district, is insufficient for the payment of all the indebtedness of the
-78-

21 the directors of such district shall file in the office of the county
22 clerk of each county in which such district is located, and in the office
23 of the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources, a
24 report attested by the secretary of the board, stating that the district
25 has disposed of its property and franchises, except for any balance of
26 funds remaining, and has discontinued operation, which report shall be
27 recorded in the miscellaneous record of such counties. Each easement and
28 right-of-way, whether owned by the district in fee or otherwise, shall
29 automatically be terminated and extinguished and such interest together
30 with any canal or other structure shall become the property of the owner
31 of the land upon which such easement, right-of-way, canal, or other

15 purchase and the cost of purchasing the same and (2) what construction
16 work it proposes to do and how it proposes to raise the funds for
17 carrying out such plan. For the purpose of ascertaining the cost of any
18 such construction work, the board shall cause such surveys, examinations,
19 and plans to be made as will demonstrate the practicability of such plan
20 and furnish the proper basis for an estimate of the costs of carrying out
21 the same. All such surveys, examinations, maps, plans, and estimates
22 shall be made under the direction of a competent irrigation engineer and
23 certified by the engineer. The board shall then submit a copy of the same
24 to the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and

6 Sec. 74. Section 46-229.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 46-229.02 (1) If, based upon the results of a field investigation or
9 upon information, however obtained, the department makes preliminary
10 determinations (a) that an appropriation has not been used, in whole or
11 in part, for a beneficial or useful purpose or having been so used at one

3 subsection (1) of this section, the Chief Water Officer director may
4 issue an order canceling the appropriation in whole or in part. The
5 extent of such cancellation shall not exceed the extent described in the
6 department's notice to the owner or owners in accordance with subsection
7 (1) of this section. A copy of the order canceling the appropriation, or
8 part thereof, shall be posted on the department's website and shall be
9 provided to the owner or owners of the appropriation and to any other
10 owner of the land under the appropriation in the same manner that notices
11 are to be given in accordance with subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section
12 46-229.03, as applicable. No cancellation under this subsection shall
13 prohibit an irrigation district, a reclamation district, a public power
14 and irrigation district, or a mutual irrigation company or canal company
15 from asserting the rights provided by subsections (5) and (6) of section
16 46-229.04.

30 such owner or owners are the only known owners of the appropriation and
31 of the land under the appropriation, the Chief Water Officer director may

2 owner or owners and shall provide a copy of such order to such owner or
3 owners.
4 (5) If the department determines that subsections (2), (3), and (4)
5 of this section do not apply, it shall schedule and conduct a hearing on
6 the cancellation of the appropriation in whole or in part. Notice of the
7 hearing shall be provided to the owner or owners who filed notices with
8 the department pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, to any other
9 owner of the appropriation known to the department, and to any other
10 owner of the land under the appropriation. The notice shall be posted on

12 in the manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section
13 46-229.03, as applicable.

2 Sec. 75. Section 46-229.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 46-229.04 (1) At a hearing held pursuant to section 46-229.03, the
5 verified field investigation report of an employee of the department, or
6 such other report or information that is relied upon by the department to
7 reach the preliminary determination of nonuse, shall be prima facie
8 evidence for the forfeiture and annulment of such water appropriation. If
9 no person appears at the hearing, such water appropriation or unused part
10 thereof shall be declared forfeited and annulled. If an interested person
11 appears and contests the same, the department shall hear evidence, and if
12 it appears that such water has not been put to a beneficial use or has
13 ceased to be used for such purpose for more than five consecutive years,
14 the same shall be declared canceled and annulled unless the department
15 finds that (a) there has been sufficient cause for such nonuse as
16 provided for in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of this section or (b)
17 subsection (5) or (6) of this section applies.
18 (2) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
19 thirty consecutive years if:
20 (a) Such nonuse was caused by the unavailability of water for that
21 use. For a river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been designated as
22 overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined by the
23 department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714, the
24 period of time within which sufficient cause for nonuse because of the
25 unavailability of water may be deemed to exist may be extended beyond
26 thirty years by the department upon petition therefor by the owner of the
27 appropriation if the department determines that an integrated management
28 plan being implemented in the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved is
29 likely to result in restoration of a usable water supply for the
30 appropriation; or
31 (b) The land subject to the appropriation is under an acreage
-88-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 reserve program or production quota or is otherwise withdrawn from use as
2 required for participation in any federal, state, or natural resources
3 district program, or such land was previously under such a program but
4 currently is not under such a program and there have been not more than
5 five consecutive years of nonuse on such land subsequent to when that
6 land was last under such program.
7 (3) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist
8 indefinitely if such nonuse was the result of one or more of the
9 following:
10 (a) For any tract of land under separate ownership, the available
11 supply was used but on only part of the land under the appropriation
12 because of an inadequate water supply;
13 (b) The appropriation is a storage appropriation and there was an
14 inadequate water supply to provide the water for the storage
15 appropriation or less than the full amount of the storage appropriation
16 was needed to keep the reservoir full; or
17 (c) The appropriation is a storage-use appropriation and there was
18 an inadequate water supply to provide the water for the appropriation or
19 use of the storage water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions.
20 (4) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
21 fifteen consecutive years if such nonuse was a result of one or more of
22 the following:
23 (a) Federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations temporarily
24 prevented or restricted such use;
25 (b) Use of the water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions;
26 (c) Circumstances were such that a prudent person, following the
27 principles of good husbandry, would not have been expected to use the
28 water;
29 (d) The works, diversions, or other facilities essential to use the
30 water were destroyed by a cause not within the control of the owner of
31 the appropriation and good faith efforts to repair or replace the works,
-89-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 diversions, or facilities have been and are being made;
2 (e) The owner of the appropriation was in active involuntary service
3 in the armed forces of the United States or was in active voluntary
4 service during a time of crisis; or
5 (f) Legal proceedings prevented or restricted use of the water.
6 The department may specify by rule and regulation other
7 circumstances that shall be deemed to constitute sufficient cause for
8 nonuse for up to fifteen years.
9 (5) When an appropriation is held in the name of an irrigation
10 district, a reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district,
11 a mutual irrigation company or canal company, or the United States Bureau
12 of Reclamation and the Chief Water Officer director determines that water
13 under that appropriation has not been used on a specific parcel of land
14 for more than five years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse
15 exists, the right to use water under that appropriation on that parcel
16 shall be terminated and notice of the termination shall be posted on the
17 department's website and shall be given in the manner provided in
18 subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The district or company
19 holding such right shall have five years after the determination, or five
20 years after an order of cancellation issued by the department following
21 the filing of a voluntary relinquishment of the water appropriation that
22 has been signed by the landowner and the appropriator of record, to
23 assign the right to use that portion of the appropriation to other land
24 within the district or the area served by the company, to file an
25 application for a transfer in accordance with section 46-290, or to
26 transfer the right in accordance with sections 46-2,127 to 46-2,129. The
27 department shall issue its order of cancellation within sixty days after
28 receipt of the voluntary relinquishment unless the relinquishment is
29 conditioned by the landowner upon an action of a governmental agency. If
30 the relinquishment contains such a provision, the department shall issue
31 its order of cancellation within sixty days after receipt of notification
-90-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 that such action has been completed. The department shall be notified of
2 any such assignment within thirty days after such assignment. If the
3 district or company does not assign the right to use that portion of the
4 appropriation to other land, does not file an application for a transfer
5 within the five-year period, or does not notify the department within
6 thirty days after any such assignment, that portion of the appropriation
7 shall be canceled without further proceedings by the department and the
8 district or company involved shall be so notified by the department.
9 During the time within which assignment of a portion of an appropriation
10 is pending, the allowable diversion rate for the appropriation involved
11 shall be reduced, as necessary, to avoid inconsistency with the rate
12 allowed by section 46-231 or with any greater rate previously approved
13 for such appropriation by the Chief Water Officer director in accordance
14 with section 46-229.06.
15 (6) When it is determined by the Chief Water Officer director that
16 an appropriation, for which the location of use has been temporarily
17 transferred in accordance with sections 46-290 to 46-294, has not been
18 used at the new location for more than five years and that no sufficient
19 cause for such nonuse exists, the right to use that appropriation at the
20 temporary location of use shall be terminated. Notice of that termination
21 shall be posted on the department's website and shall be given in the
22 manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The
23 right to reinitiate use of that appropriation at the location of use
24 prior to the temporary transfer shall continue to exist for five years
25 after the Chief Water Officer's director's determination, but if such use
26 is not reinitiated at that location within such five-year period, the
27 appropriation shall be subject to cancellation in accordance with
28 sections 46-229 to 46-229.04.
29 (7) If at the time of a hearing conducted in accordance with
30 subsection (1) of this section there is an application for incidental or
31 intentional underground water storage pending before the department and
-91-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 filed by the owner of the appropriation, the proceedings shall be
2 consolidated.
3 Sec. 76. Section 46-229.06, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 46-229.06 When a departmental proceeding that is conducted pursuant
6 to sections 46-229 to 46-229.04 concerns the partial cancellation of an
7 appropriation, the department may receive evidence on the question of
8 whether, following such partial cancellation, a reduction in the rate of
9 diversion to the maximum rate prescribed in section 46-231 would result
10 in an authorized diversion rate less than the rate necessary, in the
11 interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands
12 that remain subject to the appropriation. If the Chief Water Officer
13 director determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that such
14 rate would be less than the rate necessary, in the interests of good
15 husbandry, for the production of crops, he or she may approve a diversion
16 rate for the remaining portion of the appropriation greater than the
17 maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such increased rate can be no
18 greater than the rate authorized for the appropriation prior to the
19 partial cancellation and no greater than the rate determined by the Chief
20 Water Officer director to be necessary, in the interests of good
21 husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands that remain subject
22 to the appropriation.
23 Sec. 77. Section 46-230, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-230 (1) As the adjudication of a stream progresses and as each
26 claim is finally adjudicated, the Chief Water Officer director shall make
27 and cause to be entered of record in his or her office an order
28 determining and establishing the priorities of right to use the water of
29 such stream, the amount of the appropriation of the persons claiming
30 water from such stream and the character of use for which each
31 appropriation is found to have been made, and the address of the owner of
-92-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 each water appropriation.
2 (2) Whenever requested by the department, the owner of any
3 appropriation not held by an irrigation district, reclamation district,
4 public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal
5 company shall provide the department with the name, address, and
6 telephone number of each then-current owner of the appropriation and with
7 the name, address, and telephone number of any tenant or other person who
8 is authorized by the owner to receive opening and closing notices and
9 other departmental communications relating to the appropriation. Each
10 appropriation owner shall also notify the department any time there is a
11 change in any of such names, addresses, or telephone numbers. Notice of
12 ownership changes may be provided to the department in the manner
13 provided in section 76-2,124 or in any other manner authorized by the
14 department. If notice of an ownership change is provided other than in
15 accordance with such section, the notice shall include such evidence of
16 ownership as the Chief Water Officer director may require. Notice of all
17 other changes may be provided in any manner authorized by the department.
18 Upon receipt of any new information, the department shall update its
19 records. The department shall not collect a fee for the filing of any
20 such information or for updating its records.
21 Sec. 78. Section 46-233, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-233 (1) The United States and every person intending to
24 appropriate any of the public waters of the State of Nebraska shall,
25 before (a) commencing the construction, enlargement, or extension of any
26 works for such purpose, (b) performing any work in connection with such
27 construction, enlargement, or extension, or (c) taking any water from any
28 constructed works, make an application to the department for a permit to
29 make such appropriation. A permit may be obtained to appropriate public
30 waters for intentional underground water storage and recovery of such
31 water. A public water supplier may make application to appropriate public
-93-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 waters for induced ground water recharge.
2 (2) The application shall be upon a form prescribed and furnished by
3 the department without cost to an applicant. Such application shall set
4 forth (a) the name and post office address of the applicant, (b) the
5 source from which such appropriation shall be made, (c) the amount of the
6 appropriation desired, as nearly as it may be estimated, (d) the location
7 of any proposed work in connection with the appropriation, (e) the
8 estimated time required for its completion, which estimated time shall
9 include the period required for the construction of ditches, pumps, and
10 other features or devices, (f) the time estimated at which the
11 application of the water for the beneficial purposes shall be made, which
12 time shall be limited to a reasonable time following the estimated time
13 of completion of the work when prosecuted with diligence, (g) the purpose
14 for which water is to be applied and (i) if for induced ground water
15 recharge by a public water supplier, a statement of the times of the year
16 when and location along a stream where flows for induced ground water
17 recharge are proposed and (ii) if for irrigation, a description of the
18 land to be irrigated by the water and the amount, and (h) such facts and
19 supporting documentation as are required by the department which shall
20 include, but not be limited to, the depth of all wells, the extent of the
21 underlying aquifer, the expected rate of recharge, the minimum flow or
22 flows necessary to sustain the well field throughout the reach
23 identified, and the period of time that a well field would continue to
24 meet minimal essential needs of the public water supplier when there is
25 no flow as those factors relate to and are part of an evaluation of
26 pertinent hydrologic relationships.
27 A public water supplier making application for induced ground water
28 recharge may submit with its application a statement of the amount of
29 induced ground water recharge water which the public water supplier
30 presently uses as well as the amount of induced ground water recharge
31 water it anticipates using in the next twenty-five-year period. Such
-94-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 statement shall also quantify the total amount of water the public water
2 supplier presently uses from the well field as well as the total amount
3 of water it anticipates using from the well field in the next twenty-
4 five-year period.
5 (3) Upon receipt of an application containing the information set
6 forth in this section, the department shall (a) make a record of the
7 receipt of the application, (b) cause the application to be recorded in
8 its office, and (c) make a careful examination of the application to
9 ascertain whether it sets forth all the facts necessary to enable the
10 department to determine the nature and amount of the proposed
11 appropriation. If such an examination shows the application in any way
12 defective, it shall be returned to the applicant for correction, with a
13 statement of the correction required, within ninety days after its
14 receipt. Ninety days shall be allowed for the refiling of the
15 application, and in default of such refiling, the application shall stand
16 dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, if so
17 filed and corrected as required within such time, the application shall,
18 upon being accepted and allowed, take priority as of the date of the
19 original filing, subject to compliance with the future provisions of the
20 law and the rules and regulations thereunder. During the pendency of any
21 application or upon its approval, the department, upon proper
22 authorization and request of the applicant, may assign the application a
23 later priority date.
24 (4) For public water supplier wells in existence on September 9,
25 1993, the priority date assigned to an application for induced ground
26 water recharge made by a public water supplier shall be:

8 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1990, and on or
9 before September 9, 1993.
10 (5) Prior to taking action on an application for induced ground
11 water recharge, the Chief Water Officer director shall publish notice of
12 such application at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
13 three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
14 of the stream segment and also in a newspaper of statewide circulation.
15 The notice shall state that any person having an interest may, in
16 writing, object to the application. Any such objection shall be filed
17 with the department within two weeks after the final publication of the
18 notice.
19 (6) After the Chief Water Officer director has accepted the
20 application made under subsection (2) of this section as a completed
21 application and published notice as required under subsection (5) of this
22 section, the Chief Water Officer director shall, if he or she determines
23 that a hearing is necessary, set a time and place for a public hearing on
24 the application. The hearing shall be held within reasonable proximity to
25 the area in which the wells are or would be located. At the hearing the
26 applicant shall present all hydrological data and other evidence
27 supporting its application. All interested parties shall be allowed to
28 testify and present evidence relative to the application.
29 (7) An unapproved application pending on August 26, 1983, may be
30 amended to include appropriation for intentional underground water
31 storage and recovery of such water.

1 (8) Application may be made to the department for a temporary permit
2 to appropriate water. The same standards for granting a permanent
3 appropriation shall apply for granting such temporary permit except when
4 the temporary permit is for road construction or other public use
5 construction and the amount of water requested is less than ten acre-feet
6 in total volume. For temporary permits for public-use construction, the
7 applicant shall include on the application the location of the diversion,
8 the location of use, a description of the project, the amount of water
9 requested, and the person to contact. Temporary permits for public-use
10 construction and for less than ten acre-feet in total volume may be
11 granted without any determination of unappropriated water and shall be
12 considered to be in the public interest. The requirement of filing a map
13 or plans with the application for a temporary permit may be waived at the
14 discretion of the Chief Water Officer director. In granting a temporary
15 permit, the Chief Water Officer director shall specify a date on which
16 the right to appropriate water under the permit shall expire. Under no
17 circumstances shall such date be longer than one calendar year after the
18 date the temporary permit was granted. Temporary permits shall be
19 administered during times of shortage based on priority. The right to
20 appropriate water shall automatically terminate on the date specified by
21 the Chief Water Officer director on the temporary permit without further
22 action by the department.
23 (9) Water may be diverted from any stream, reservoir, or canal by
24 any fire department or emergency response services for the purpose of
25 extinguishing a fire in progress in an emergency without obtaining a
26 permit from the department. The installation of a dry well for this
27 purpose is allowed without the prior permission of the department, but
28 the department shall be informed of any such installation, its location,
29 and the party responsible for its installation and maintenance within
30 thirty days after the installation.
31 Sec. 79. Section 46-233.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
-97-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 amended to read:
2 46-233.01 (1) Application may be made to the department for a permit
3 to appropriate any of the public surface waters of the State of Nebraska
4 to be diverted or stored in Nebraska for use in any other state.
5 (2) In determining whether to grant such application, the Chief
6 Water Officer director shall consider the following factors:
7 (a) Whether unappropriated water exists in the source of supply
8 named in the application;
9 (b) Whether such application and appropriation when perfected are
10 not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
11 (c) Whether denial of the application is demanded by the public
12 interest; and
13 (d) Whether the proposed use is a beneficial use of water.
14 (3) When determining whether denial of such application is demanded
15 by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall consider
16 the following factors:
17 (a) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
18 use;
19 (b) Any adverse economic, environmental, and other impacts of the
20 proposed use;
21 (c) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
22 water;
23 (d) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of not allowing
24 the appropriation and preserving the water supply for beneficial uses
25 within the state;
26 (e) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
27 and
28 (f) Any other factors consistent with the purposes of this section
29 that the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant to protecting the
30 interests of the state and its citizens.
31 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
-98-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 overall benefits to Nebraska are greater than the adverse impacts to
2 Nebraska. The Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying
3 an application shall specify the reasons for such action, including a
4 discussion of the required factors for consideration, and shall document
5 such decision by reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any
6 other sources used by the Chief Water Officer director in making the
7 decision.
8 Sec. 80. Section 46-235, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
9 amended to read:
10 46-235 (1) For applications other than those to appropriate public
11 waters for induced ground water recharge, if there is unappropriated
12 water in the source of supply named in the application, if such
13 application and appropriation when perfected are not otherwise
14 detrimental to the public welfare, and if denial of the application is
15 not demanded by the public interest, the department shall approve the
16 application and shall make a record in its office and return the
17 application to the applicant, who shall on receipt thereof be authorized
18 to proceed with the work and to take such measures as may be necessary to
19 perfect such application into an appropriation. The priority of such
20 application and appropriation when perfected shall date from the filing
21 of the application in the office of the department, and the date of
22 filing shall be regarded as the priority number thereof. The department
23 may, upon examination of such application, approve it for a shorter
24 period of time for perfecting the proposed appropriation or for a smaller
25 amount of water or of land than applied for. The department may also
26 impose such other reasonable conditions as it deems appropriate to
27 protect the public interest. An applicant aggrieved by the action of the
28 department shall, upon proper showing, be granted a hearing before the
29 department, which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules
30 of procedure adopted by the department, and a full and complete record
31 shall be kept of all such proceedings. When a complete record of the case
-99-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 has been made up, the department shall render an opinion of facts and of
2 law based upon the evidence before it.
3 (2)(a) An application for an induced ground water recharge
4 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
5 service before September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief Water
6 Officer director if he or she finds that:
7 (i) The appropriation is necessary to maintain the well or wells for
8 the use or uses for which the appropriation has been requested;
9 (ii) The rate and timing of the flow is the amount reasonably
10 necessary to maintain the well or wells for the uses for which the
11 appropriation has been requested; and
12 (iii) The application is in the public interest and is not
13 detrimental to the public welfare. There shall be a rebuttable
14 presumption that wells which are the subject of an application pursuant
15 to subdivision (2)(a) of this section are in the public interest and are
16 not detrimental to the public welfare.
17 (b) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application for
18 a well or wells constructed before September 9, 1993, but may
19 specifically deny the applicant the right to request regulation of junior
20 appropriators if the Chief Water Officer director, at the time of
21 approval, finds that the well or wells, at the time of their
22 construction, were not located, designed, or constructed so as to take
23 reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the area to minimize the
24 frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced ground water
25 recharge. Thereafter a public water supplier holding an approved
26 application which has been denied the right to request regulation of
27 junior appropriators may petition the Chief Water Officer director for a
28 hearing to present evidence showing the Chief Water Officer director that
29 the well or wells have been modified, relocated, or reconstructed to take
30 reasonable advantage of the aquifer conditions in the area. If the Chief
31 Water Officer director determines that the well or wells have been so
-100-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 modified, relocated, or reconstructed, the Chief Water Officer director
2 shall cause to be modified the approval of the application to allow for
3 the regulation of junior appropriators, subject to the restrictions or
4 conditions applicable to public water suppliers.
5 (c) An application for an induced ground water recharge
6 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
7 service before September 9, 1993, shall not be subject to the
8 requirements of sections 46-288 and 46-289.
9 (3) An application for an induced ground water recharge
10 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed or to be
11 constructed on or after September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief
12 Water Officer director if he or she makes the findings required by
13 subdivision (2)(a) of this section and further finds that:
14 (a) There is unappropriated water available for the appropriation;
15 and
16 (b) The well or wells involved have been or will be located and
17 constructed to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the
18 area to minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for
19 induced ground water recharge.
20 (4)(a) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application
21 filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section for a smaller amount of
22 water than requested by the applicant. The Chief Water Officer director
23 may also impose reasonable conditions on the manner and timing of the
24 appropriation which the Chief Water Officer director deems necessary to
25 protect the public interest. The Chief Water Officer director may grant
26 an appropriation for specific months of the year if so demanded by the
27 public interest. If the Chief Water Officer director approves the
28 application, he or she shall issue a written order, which written order
29 shall include the findings required by this section, the amount of the
30 appropriation, and any conditions or limitations imposed under this
31 section.

1 (b) In determining whether an application for an appropriation for
2 induced ground water recharge is in the public interest, the Chief Water
3 Officer's director's considerations shall include, but not be limited to,
4 the possible adverse effects on existing surface water or ground water
5 users and the economic, social, and environmental value of such uses,
6 including, but not limited to, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife,
7 public water supply, induced ground water recharge for public water
8 supply systems, and water quality maintenance.
9 (c) The stream segment and the determination of a reasonable and
10 necessary amount of water required for induced ground water recharge
11 purposes throughout the reach shall be defined specifically by the Chief
12 Water Officer director in the order issued under this section.
13 Sec. 81. Section 46-250, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-250 The owner of any ditch, storage reservoir, storage capacity,
16 or other device for appropriating water may, upon petition to the
17 Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources, and upon
18 its approval, change the point at which the water under any water
19 appropriation of record is diverted from a natural stream or reservoir,
20 change the line of any flume, ditch, or aqueduct, or change a storage
21 site. No reclamation district or power appropriator may change the
22 established return flow point without the approval of the department.
23 Sec. 82. Section 46-252, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-252 (1) Any person may conduct, either from outside the state or
26 from sources located in the state, quantities of water over and above
27 those already present into or along any of the natural streams or
28 channels of this state, for purposes of instream beneficial uses or
29 withdrawal of some or all of such water for out-of-stream beneficial
30 uses, at any point without regard to any prior appropriation of water
31 from such stream, due allowance being made for losses in transit to be

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 determined by the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural
2 Resources. The department shall monitor movement of the water by
3 measurements or other means and shall be responsible for assuring that
4 such quantities are not subsequently diverted or withdrawn by others
5 unless they are authorized to do so by the person conducting the water.
6 (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section,
7 before any person may conduct water into or along any of the natural
8 streams or channels of the state, he or she shall first obtain a permit
9 from the department. Application for the permit shall be made on forms
10 provided by the department. Applications shall include plans and
11 specifications detailing the intended times, amounts, and streamreach
12 locations and such other information as required by the department. The
13 water subject to such a permit shall be deemed appropriated for the use
14 specified in the permit. Permitholders shall be liable for any damages
15 resulting from the overflow of such stream or channel when water so
16 conducted contributed to such overflow.
17 (3) Any person actually engaged in the construction or operation of
18 any water power plant may, without filing with the department and upon
19 payment of all damages, use any such stream or channel for a tailrace or
20 canal and may, whenever necessary, widen, deepen, or straighten the bed
21 of any such stream. All damages resulting therefrom shall be determined
22 in the manner set forth in sections 76-704 to 76-724.
23 (4) Any person holding a storage use permit pursuant to section
24 46-242 shall not be required to obtain the permit required by this
25 section.
26 (5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt a person
27 from obtaining any other permits required by law.
28 Sec. 83. Section 46-254, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

4 lands, or allows the same to be done, or uses or allows to be used any
5 water upon any land or lands, or for any other purpose whatsoever,
6 without authority from the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
7 Natural Resources, or who stores water in or releases water from a
8 reservoir other than in compliance with orders of the department Director
9 of Natural Resources or his or her representative, shall be guilty of a
10 Class II misdemeanor. Each day that the water is allowed to run without
11 authority from the department shall constitute a separate offense.
12 Sec. 84. Section 46-256, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
13 amended to read:
14 46-256 Persons owning or controlling any ditch, canal, or reservoir
15 for the purpose of storing or using water for any purpose shall, upon
16 thirty days' notice by the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
17 Natural Resources, construct and maintain at the point of diversion a
18 substantial headgate, of a design approved by the department, so built
19 that it may be closed, or partially closed and fastened at any stage with
20 lock or seal. They shall also construct a device for measuring and
21 apportioning the water appropriated, which device shall be of a design
22 approved by the department and built at the most practical point to be
23 selected and fixed by it. If they neglect or refuse, for a period of ten
24 days, to construct such headgate and measuring device, the department
25 shall refuse to allow any water to be delivered to or used by or through

14 any project constructed by the United States pursuant to the provisions
15 of an Act of Congress approved June 17, 1902, being An Act providing for
16 the reclamation of arid lands (32 Stat. L. 388), and all acts amendatory
17 thereof and supplemental thereto. When the officers of the United States
18 Bureau of Reclamation determine that any water so developed or stored is
19 in excess of the needs of the project as then completed or is flood or
20 unused water, the United States may contract to furnish such developed,
21 stored, flood, or unused water, under the terms and conditions imposed by
22 Act of Congress and the rules and regulations of the United States, to
23 any person who may have theretofore been granted a permit to appropriate
24 a portion of the normal flow of any stream, if the water so appropriated
25 shall, during some portion of the year, be found insufficient for the
26 needs of the land to which it is appurtenant. The United States and every
27 person entering into a contract as herein provided shall have the right
28 to conduct such water into and along any of the natural streams of the
29 state, but not so as to raise the waters thereof above the ordinary high
30 water mark, and may take out the same again at any point desired, without

11 water for irrigation. The portion of a natural stream that is shown as an
12 intermittent stream on the most recent United States Geological Survey
13 topographic quadrangle map published prior to July 18, 2008, shall be
14 considered an ephemeral natural stream unless the Department of Water,
15 Energy, and Environment Natural Resources has investigated the stream and
16 determined that the stream or a reach of the stream is perennial or
17 intermittent and subject to Chapter 46, article 2. The department's
18 determination for the purposes of this section shall be adopted and
19 promulgated in rule or regulation.
20 Sec. 90. Section 46-288, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

15 Sec. 91. Section 46-289, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 46-289 The Legislature finds, recognizes, and declares that the
18 transfer of water to outside the boundaries of a river basin may have
19 impacts on the water and other resources in the basin and that such
20 impacts differ from those caused by uses of water within the same basin
21 in part because any unused water will not be returned to the stream from
22 which it is taken for further use in that river basin. The Legislature
23 therefor recognizes the need to delineate factors for consideration by
24 the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
25 Environment Director of Natural Resources when evaluating an application
26 made pursuant to section 46-233 which involves an interbasin transfer of
27 water in order to determine whether denial of such application is
28 demanded by the public interest. Those considerations shall include, but
29 not be limited to, the following factors:
30 (1) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
31 interbasin transfer and use;

10 (7) Alternative sources of water available to the basin of origin
11 for future beneficial uses.
12 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
13 overall benefits to the state and the applicant's basin are greater than
14 or equal to the adverse impacts to the state and the basin of origin. The
15 Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying an application
16 shall specify the reasons for such action, including a discussion of the
17 required factors for consideration, and shall document such decision by
18 reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any other sources used by
19 the Chief Water Officer director in making the decision.
20 Sec. 92. Section 46-290, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-290 (1)(a) Except as provided in this section and sections
23 46-2,120 to 46-2,130, any person having a permit to appropriate water for
24 beneficial purposes issued pursuant to sections 46-233 to 46-235,
25 46-240.01, 46-241, 46-242, or 46-637 and who desires (i) to transfer the
26 use of such appropriation to a location other than the location specified
27 in the permit, (ii) to change that appropriation to a different type of
28 appropriation as provided in subsection (3) of this section, or (iii) to
29 change the purpose for which the water is to be used under a natural-
30 flow, storage, or storage-use appropriation to a purpose not at that time
31 permitted under the appropriation shall apply for approval of such
-110-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 transfer or change to the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
2 Natural Resources.
3 (b) The application for such approval shall contain (i) the number
4 assigned to such appropriation by the department, (ii) the name and
5 address of the present holder of the appropriation, (iii) if applicable,
6 the name and address of the person or entity to whom the appropriation
7 would be transferred or who will be the user of record after a change in
8 the location of use, type of appropriation, or purpose of use under the
9 appropriation, (iv) the legal description of the land to which the
10 appropriation is now appurtenant, (v) the name and address of each holder
11 of a mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent consensual security
12 interest against the tract or tracts of land to which the appropriation
13 is now appurtenant, (vi) if applicable, the legal description of the land
14 to which the appropriation is proposed to be transferred, (vii) if a
15 transfer is proposed, whether other sources of water are available at the
16 original location of use and whether any provisions have been made to
17 prevent either use of a new source of water at the original location or
18 increased use of water from any existing source at that location, (viii)
19 if applicable, the legal descriptions of the beginning and end of the
20 stream reach to which the appropriation is proposed to be transferred for
21 the purpose of augmenting the flows in that stream reach, (ix) if a
22 proposed transfer is for the purpose of increasing the quantity of water
23 available for use pursuant to another appropriation, the number assigned
24 to such other appropriation by the department, (x) the purpose of the
25 current use, (xi) if a change in purpose of use is proposed, the proposed
26 purpose of use, (xii) if a change in the type of appropriation is
27 proposed, the type of appropriation to which a change is desired, (xiii)
28 if a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, the
29 duration of the proposed transfer or change, and (xiv) such other
30 information as the department by rule and regulation requires.
31 (2) If a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, a
-111-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 copy of the proposed agreement between the current appropriator and the
2 person who is to be responsible for use of water under the appropriation
3 while the transfer or change is in effect shall be submitted at the same
4 time as the application.
5 (3) Regardless of whether a transfer or a change in the purpose of
6 use is involved, the following changes in type of appropriation, if found
7 by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
8 Environment Director of Natural Resources to be consistent with section
9 46-294, may be approved subject to the following:
10 (a) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use may be
11 changed to a natural-flow appropriation for aboveground reservoir storage
12 or for intentional underground water storage;
13 (b) A natural-flow appropriation for intentional underground water
14 storage may be changed to a natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-
15 stream use or for aboveground reservoir storage;
16 (c) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
17 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
18 storage may be changed to an instream appropriation subject to sections
19 46-2,107 to 46-2,119 if the Chief Water Officer director determines that
20 the resulting instream appropriation would be consistent with
21 subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of section 46-2,115;
22 (d) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
23 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
24 storage may be changed to an appropriation for induced ground water
25 recharge if the Chief Water Officer director determines that the
26 resulting appropriation for induced ground water recharge would be
27 consistent with subdivisions (2)(a)(i) and (ii) of section 46-235;
28 (e) An appropriation for the manufacturing of hydropower at a
29 facility located on a natural stream channel may be permanently changed
30 in full to an instream basin-management appropriation to be held jointly
31 by the Game and Parks Commission and any natural resources district or
-112-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 combination of natural resources districts. The beneficial use of such
2 change is to maintain the streamflow for fish, wildlife, and recreation
3 that was available from the manufacturing of hydropower prior to the
4 change. Such changed appropriation may also be utilized by the owners of
5 the appropriation to assist in the implementation of an approved
6 integrated management plan or plans developed pursuant to sections 46-714
7 to 46-718 for each natural resources district within the river basin. Any
8 such change under this section shall be subject to review under sections
9 46-229 to 46-229.06 to ensure that the beneficial uses of the change of
10 use are still being achieved; and
11 (f) The incidental underground water storage portion, whether or not
12 previously quantified, of a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation may
13 be separated from the direct-use portion of the appropriation and may be
14 changed to a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation for intentional
15 underground water storage at the same location if the historic
16 consumptive use of the direct-use portion of the appropriation is
17 transferred to another location or is terminated, but such a separation
18 and change may be approved only if, after the separation and change, (i)
19 the total permissible diversion under the appropriation will not
20 increase, (ii) the projected consequences of the separation and change
21 are consistent with the provisions of any integrated management plan
22 adopted in accordance with section 46-718 or 46-719 for the geographic
23 area involved, and (iii) if the location of the proposed intentional
24 underground water storage is in a river basin, subbasin, or reach
25 designated as overappropriated in accordance with section 46-713, the
26 integrated management plan for that river basin, subbasin, or reach has
27 gone into effect, and that plan requires that the amount of the
28 intentionally stored water that is consumed after the change will be no
29 greater than the amount of the incidentally stored water that was
30 consumed prior to the change. Approval of a separation and change
31 pursuant to this subdivision (f) shall not exempt any consumptive use
-113-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 associated with the incidental recharge right from any reduction in water
2 use required by an integrated management plan for a river basin,
3 subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated in accordance with
4 section 46-713.
5 Whenever any change in type of appropriation is approved pursuant to
6 this subsection and as long as that change remains in effect, the
7 appropriation shall be subject to the statutes, rules, and regulations
8 that apply to the type of appropriation to which the change has been
9 made.
10 (4) The Legislature finds that induced ground water recharge
11 appropriations issued pursuant to sections 46-233 and 46-235 and instream
12 appropriations issued pursuant to section 46-2,115 are specific to the
13 location identified in the appropriation. Neither type of appropriation
14 shall be transferred to a different location, changed to a different type
15 of appropriation, or changed to permit a different purpose of use.
16 (5) In addition to any other purposes for which transfers and
17 changes may be approved, such transfers and changes may be approved if
18 the purpose is (a) to maintain or augment the flow in a specific stream
19 reach for any instream use that the department has determined, through
20 rules and regulations, to be a beneficial use or (b) to increase the
21 frequency that a diversion rate or rate of flow specified in another
22 valid appropriation is achieved.
23 For any transfer or change approved pursuant to subdivision (a) of
24 this subsection, the department shall be provided with a report at least
25 every five years while such transfer or change is in effect. The purpose
26 of such report shall be to indicate whether the beneficial instream use
27 for which the flow is maintained or augmented continues to exist. If the
28 report indicates that it does not or if no report is filed within sixty
29 days after the department's notice to the appropriator that the deadline
30 for filing the report has passed, the department may cancel its approval
31 of the transfer or change and such appropriation shall revert to the same
-114-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 location of use, type of appropriation, and purpose of use as prior to
2 such approval.
3 (6) A quantified or unquantified appropriation for incidental
4 underground water storage may be transferred to a new location along with
5 the direct-use appropriation with which it is recognized if the Chief
6 Water Officer director finds such transfer to be consistent with section
7 46-294 and determines that the geologic and other relevant conditions at
8 the new location are such that incidental underground water storage will
9 occur at the new location. The Chief Water Officer director may request
10 such information from the applicant as is needed to make such
11 determination and may modify any such quantified appropriation for
12 incidental underground water storage, if necessary, to reflect the
13 geologic and other conditions at the new location.
14 (7) Unless an incidental underground water storage appropriation is
15 changed as authorized by subdivision (3)(f) of this section or is
16 transferred as authorized by subsection (6) of this section or subsection
17 (1) of section 46-291, such appropriation shall be canceled or modified,
18 as appropriate, by the Chief Water Officer director to reflect any
19 reduction in water that will be stored underground as the result of a
20 transfer or change of the direct-use appropriation with which the
21 incidental underground water storage was recognized prior to the transfer
22 or change.
23 (8) Any appropriation for manufacturing of hydropower changed under
24 subdivision (3)(e) of this section shall maintain the priority date and
25 preference category of the original manufacturing appropriation and shall
26 be subject to condemnation and subordination pursuant to sections 70-668
27 and 70-669. Any person holding a subordination agreement that was
28 established prior to such change of appropriation shall be entitled to
29 enter into a new subordination agreement for terms consistent with the
30 original subordination agreement at no additional cost. Any person having
31 obtained a condemnation award that was established prior to such change
-115-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 of appropriation shall be entitled to the same benefits created by such
2 award, and any obligations created by such award shall become the
3 obligations of the new owner of the appropriation changed under this
4 section.
5 Sec. 93. Section 46-291, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
6 amended to read:
7 46-291 (1) Upon receipt of an application filed under section 46-290
8 for a transfer in the location of use of an appropriation, the Department
9 of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources shall review it for
10 compliance with this subsection. The Chief Water Officer of the
11 Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of Natural
12 Resources may approve the application without notice or hearing if he or
13 she determines that: (a) The appropriation is used and will continue to
14 be used exclusively for irrigation purposes; (b) the only lands involved
15 in the proposed transfer are (i) lands within the quarter section of land
16 to which the appropriation is appurtenant, (ii) lands within such quarter
17 section of land and one or more quarter sections of land each of which is
18 contiguous to the quarter section of land to which the appropriation is
19 appurtenant, or (iii) lands within the boundaries or service area of and
20 capable of service by the same irrigation district, reclamation district,
21 public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal
22 company; (c) after the transfer, the total number of acres irrigated
23 under the appropriation will be no greater than the number of acres that
24 could legally be irrigated under the appropriation prior to the transfer;
25 (d) all the land involved in the transfer is under the same ownership or
26 is within the same irrigation district, reclamation district, public
27 power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company; (e)
28 the transfer will not result in a change in the point of diversion or the
29 point of diversion will be changed but the change meets the following
30 requirements: (i) The new point of diversion is on the same named stream,
31 the same tributary, or the same river or creek as the approved point of
-116-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 diversion; (ii) the proposed point of diversion will not move above or
2 below an existing diversion point owned by another appropriator; and
3 (iii) the proposed point of diversion will not move above or below a
4 tributary stream or a constructed river return or a constructed drain;
5 and (f) the transfer will not diminish the water supply available for or
6 otherwise adversely affect any other surface water appropriator. If
7 transfer of an appropriation with associated incidental underground water
8 storage is approved in accordance with this subsection, the associated
9 incidental underground water storage also may be transferred pursuant to
10 this subsection as long as such transfer would continue to be consistent
11 with the requirements of this subsection. If necessary, the boundaries of
12 the incidental underground water storage area may be modified to reflect
13 any change in the location of that storage consistent with such a
14 transfer. Transfers shall not be approved pursuant to this subsection
15 until the department has adopted and promulgated rules and regulations
16 establishing the criteria it will use to determine whether proposed
17 transfers are consistent with subdivision (1)(f) of this section.
18 (2) If after reviewing an application filed under section 46-290 the
19 Chief Water Officer director determines that it cannot be approved
20 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, he or she shall cause a
21 notice of such application to be posted on the department's website, to
22 be sent by certified mail to each holder of a mortgage, trust deed, or
23 other equivalent consensual security interest that is identified by the
24 applicant pursuant to subdivision (1)(b)(v) of section 46-290 and to any
25 entity owning facilities currently used or proposed to be used for
26 purposes of diversion or delivery of water under the appropriation, and
27 to be published at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
28 three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation
29 in each county containing lands to which the appropriation is appurtenant
30 and, if applicable, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
31 each county containing lands to which the appropriation is proposed to be
-117-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 transferred.
2 (3) The notice shall contain: (a) A description of the
3 appropriation; (b) the number assigned to such appropriation in the
4 records of the department; (c) the date of priority; (d) if applicable, a
5 description of the land or stream reach to which such water appropriation
6 is proposed to be transferred; (e) if applicable, the type of
7 appropriation to which the appropriation is proposed to be changed; (f)
8 if applicable, the proposed change in the purpose of use; (g) whether the
9 proposed transfer or change is to be permanent or temporary and, if
10 temporary, the duration of the proposed transfer or change; and (h) any
11 other information the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant and
12 essential to provide the interested public with adequate notice of the
13 proposed transfer or change.
14 (4) The notice shall state (a) that any interested person may object
15 to and request a hearing on the application by filing such objections in
16 writing specifically stating the grounds for each objection and (b) that
17 any such objection and request shall be filed in the office of the
18 department within two weeks after the date of final publication of the
19 notice.
20 (5) Within the time period allowed by this section for the filing of
21 objections and requests for hearings, the county board of any county
22 containing land to which the appropriation is appurtenant and, if
23 applicable, the county board of any county containing land to which the
24 appropriation is proposed to be transferred may provide the department
25 with comments about the potential economic impacts of the proposed
26 transfer or change in such county. The filing of any such comments by a
27 county board shall not make the county a party in the application
28 process, but such comments shall be considered by the Chief Water Officer
29 director in determining pursuant to section 46-294 whether the proposed
30 transfer or change is in the public interest.
31 Sec. 94. Section 46-292, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
-118-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 amended to read:
2 46-292 The Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural
3 Resources may hold a hearing on an application filed under section 46-290
4 on its own motion and shall hold a hearing if a timely request therefor
5 is filed by any interested person in accordance with section 46-291. Any
6 such hearing shall be subject to section 61-206.
7 Sec. 95. Section 46-293, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
8 amended to read:
9 46-293 (1) The Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water,
10 Energy, and Environment Director of Natural Resources shall independently
11 review each application subject to subsection (2) of section 46-291 to
12 determine whether the requirements of section 46-294 will be met if the
13 transfer or change is approved. The requirement of this subsection is not
14 altered when there are objectors who have become parties to the proposed
15 transfer or change, but if a hearing is called by the Department of
16 Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources on its own motion or as
17 the result of a request therefor filed in accordance with subsection (4)
18 of section 46-291, any evidence considered by the Chief Water Officer
19 director in making such determinations shall be made a part of the record
20 of the hearing as provided in section 84-914.
21 (2) Either on his or her own motion or in response to objections or
22 comments received pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of section 46-291,
23 the Chief Water Officer director may require the applicant to provide
24 additional information before a hearing will be scheduled or, if no
25 hearing is to be held, before the application will receive further
26 consideration. The information requested may include economic, social, or
27 environmental impact analyses of the proposed transfer or change,
28 information about the amount of water historically consumed under the
29 appropriation, copies of any plans for mitigation of any anticipated
30 adverse impacts that would result from the proposed transfer or change,
31 and such other information as the Chief Water Officer director deems
-119-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 necessary in order to determine whether the proposed transfer or change
2 is consistent with section 46-294.
3 Sec. 96. Section 46-294, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 46-294 (1) Except for applications approved in accordance with
6 subsection (1) of section 46-291, the Chief Water Officer of the
7 Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of Natural
8 Resources shall approve an application filed pursuant to section 46-290
9 only if the application and the proposed transfer or change meet the
10 following requirements:
11 (a) The application is complete and all other information requested
12 pursuant to section 46-293 has been provided;
13 (b) The proposed use of water after the transfer or change will be a
14 beneficial use of water;
15 (c)(i) Any requested transfer in the location of use is within the
16 same river basin as defined in section 46-288 or (ii) the river basin
17 from which the appropriation is to be transferred is tributary to the
18 river basin to which the appropriation is to be transferred;
19 (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,
20 the proposed transfer or change, alone or when combined with any new or
21 increased use of any other source of water at the original location or
22 within the same irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
23 and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company for the
24 original or other purposes, will not diminish the supply of water
25 available for or otherwise adversely affect any other water appropriator
26 and will not significantly adversely affect any riparian water user who
27 files an objection in writing pursuant to section 46-291;
28 (e) The quantity of water that is transferred for diversion or other
29 use at the new location will not exceed the historic consumptive use
30 under the appropriation or portion thereof being transferred, except that
31 this subdivision does not apply to (i) a transfer in the location of use
-120-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 if both the current use and the proposed use are for irrigation, the
2 number of acres to be irrigated will not increase after the transfer, and
3 the location of the diversion from the stream will not change or (ii) a
4 transfer or change in the purpose of use of a surface water irrigation
5 appropriation as provided for in subsection (3), (5), or (6) of section
6 46-290 if the transfer or change in purpose will not diminish the supply
7 of water available or otherwise adversely affect any other water
8 appropriator, adversely affect Nebraska's ability to meet its obligations
9 under a multistate agreement, or result in administration of the prior
10 appropriation system by the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
11 Natural Resources, which would not have otherwise occurred;
12 (f) The appropriation, prior to the transfer or change, is not
13 subject to termination or cancellation pursuant to sections 46-229 to
14 46-229.04;
15 (g) If a proposed transfer or change is of an appropriation that has
16 been used for irrigation and is in the name of an irrigation district,
17 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
18 irrigation or canal company or is dependent upon any such district's or
19 company's facilities for water delivery, such district or company has
20 approved the transfer or change;
21 (h) If the proposed transfer or change is of a storage-use
22 appropriation and if the owner of that appropriation is different from
23 the owner of the associated storage appropriation, the owner of the
24 storage appropriation has approved the transfer or change;
25 (i) If the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent, either
26 (i) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the transfer or
27 change is in the same preference category established by section 46-204
28 as the purpose for which the water is to be used after the transfer or
29 change or (ii) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the
30 transfer or change and the purpose for which the water is to be used
31 after the transfer or change are both purposes for which no preferences
-121-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 are established by section 46-204;
2 (j) If the proposed transfer or change is to be temporary, it will
3 be for a duration of no less than one year and, except as provided in
4 section 46-294.02, no more than thirty years;
5 (k) The transfer or change will not be inconsistent with any
6 applicable state or federal law and will not jeopardize the state's
7 compliance with any applicable interstate water compact or decree or
8 cause difficulty in fulfilling the provisions of any other formal state
9 contract or agreement; and
10 (l) The proposed transfer or change is in the public interest. The
11 Chief Water Officer's director's considerations relative to the public
12 interest shall include, but not be limited to, (i) the economic, social,
13 and environmental impacts of the proposed transfer or change and (ii)
14 whether and under what conditions other sources of water are available
15 for the uses to be made of the appropriation after the proposed transfer
16 or change. The Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural
17 Resources shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to govern the
18 Chief Water Officer's director's determination of whether a proposed
19 transfer or change is in the public interest.
20 (2) The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed
21 transfer or change will comply with subdivisions (1)(a) through (l) of
22 this section, except that (a) the burden is on a riparian user to
23 demonstrate his or her riparian status and to demonstrate a significant
24 adverse effect on his or her use in order to prevent approval of an
25 application and (b) if both the current use and the proposed use after a
26 transfer are for irrigation, the number of acres to be irrigated will not
27 increase after the transfer, and the location of the diversion from the
28 stream will not change, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
29 transfer will be consistent with subdivision (1)(d) of this section.
30 (3) In approving an application, the Chief Water Officer director
31 may impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to protect the
-122-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 public interest, to ensure consistency with any of the other criteria in
2 subsection (1) of this section, or to provide the department with
3 information needed to properly and efficiently administer the
4 appropriation while the transfer or change remains in effect. If
5 necessary to prevent diminution of supply for any other appropriator, the
6 conditions imposed by the Chief Water Officer director shall require that
7 historic return flows be maintained or replaced in quantity, timing, and
8 location. After approval of any such transfer or change, the
9 appropriation shall be subject to all water use restrictions and
10 requirements in effect at any new location of use and, if applicable, at
11 any new diversion location. An appropriation for which a transfer or
12 change has been approved shall retain the same priority date as that of
13 the original appropriation. If an approved transfer or change is
14 temporary, the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation
15 shall revert to the location of use, purpose of use, or type of
16 appropriation prior to the transfer or change.
17 (4) In approving an application for a transfer, the Chief Water
18 Officer director may also authorize the overlying of water appropriations
19 on the same lands, except that if any such overlying of appropriations
20 would result in either the authorized diversion rate or the authorized
21 aggregate annual quantity that could be diverted to be greater than is
22 otherwise permitted by section 46-231, the Chief Water Officer director
23 shall limit the total diversion rate or aggregate annual quantity for the
24 appropriations overlain to the rate or quantity that he or she determines
25 is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of
26 crops on the land involved. The Chief Water Officer director may also
27 authorize a greater number of acres to be irrigated if the amount and
28 rate of water approved under the original appropriation is not increased

2025 2025
1 transmissivity, saturated thickness maps, and other ground water
2 reservoir information, if available;
3 (2) Local recharge characteristics and rates from any sources, if
4 available;
5 (3) Average annual precipitation and the variations within the
6 district;
7 (4) Crop water needs within the district;
8 (5) Current ground water data-collection programs;
9 (6) Past, present, and potential ground water use within the
10 district;
11 (7) Ground water quality concerns within the district;
12 (8) Proposed water conservation and supply augmentation programs for
13 the district;

17 from different sources of supply;
18 (11) Ground water management objectives, including a proposed ground
19 water reservoir life goal for the district. For management plans adopted
20 or revised after July 19, 1996, the ground water management objectives
21 may include any proposed integrated management objectives for
22 hydrologically connected ground water and surface water supplies but a
23 management plan does not have to be revised prior to the adoption or
24 implementation of an integrated management plan pursuant to section
25 46-718 or 46-719;
26 (12) Existing subirrigation uses within the district;
27 (13) The relative economic value of different uses of ground water
28 proposed or existing within the district; and
29 (14) The geographic and stratigraphic boundaries of any proposed
30 management area.
31 If the expenses incurred by a district preparing or amending a
-180-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 ground water management plan exceed twenty-five percent of the district's
2 current budget, the district may make application to the Nebraska
3 Resources Development Fund for assistance.
4 Each district's ground water management plan shall also identify, to
5 the extent possible, the levels and sources of ground water contamination
6 within the district, ground water quality goals, long-term solutions
7 necessary to prevent the levels of ground water contaminants from
8 becoming too high and to reduce high levels sufficiently to eliminate
9 health hazards, and practices recommended to stabilize, reduce, and
10 prevent the occurrence, increase, or spread of ground water
11 contamination.
12 Sec. 169. Section 46-711, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
13 amended to read:
14 46-711 (1) The director Director of Natural Resources shall review
15 any ground water management plan or plan modification submitted by a
16 district to ensure that the best available studies, data, and
17 information, whether previously existing or newly initiated, were
18 utilized and considered and that such plan is supported by and is a
19 reasonable application of such information. If a management area is
20 proposed and the primary purpose of the proposed management area is
21 protection of water quality, the director shall consult with the
22 Department of Environment and Energy regarding approval or denial of the
23 management plan. The director shall consult with the Conservation and
24 Survey Division of the University of Nebraska and such other state or
25 federal agencies the director shall deem necessary when reviewing plans.
26 Within ninety days after receipt of a plan, the director shall transmit
27 his or her specific findings, conclusions, and reasons for approval or
28 disapproval to the district submitting the plan.
29 (2) If the director Director of Natural Resources disapproves a
30 ground water management plan, the district which submitted the plan
31 shall, in order to establish a management area, submit to the director
-181-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 either the original or a revised plan with an explanation of how the
2 original or revised plan addresses the issues raised by the director in
3 his or her reasons for disapproval. Once a district has submitted an
4 explanation pursuant to this section, such district may proceed to
5 schedule a hearing pursuant to section 46-712.
6 Sec. 170. Section 46-712, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 46-712 (1) A natural resources district may establish a ground water
9 management area in accordance with this section to accomplish any one or
10 more of the following objectives: (a) Protection of ground water
11 quantity; (b) protection of ground water quality; or (c) prevention or
12 resolution of conflicts between users of ground water and appropriators
13 of surface water, which ground water and surface water are hydrologically
14 connected.
15 (2) Prior to establishment by a district of a management area other
16 than a management area being established in accordance with section
17 46-718, the district's management plan shall have been approved by the
18 director Director of Natural Resources or the district shall have
19 completed the requirements of subsection (2) of section 46-711. If
20 necessary to determine whether a management area should be designated,
21 the district may initiate new studies and data-collection efforts and
22 develop computer models. In order to establish a management area, the
23 district shall fix a time and place for a public hearing to consider the
24 management plan information supplied by the director and to hear any
25 other evidence. The hearing shall be located within or in reasonable
26 proximity to the area proposed for designation as a management area.
27 Notice of the hearing shall be published as provided in section 46-743,
28 and the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with such section.
29 (3)(a) Within ninety days after the hearing, the district shall
30 determine whether a management area shall be designated. If the district
31 determines that no management area shall be established, the district
-182-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 shall issue an order to that effect.
2 (b) If the district determines that a management area shall be
3 established, the district shall by order designate the area as a
4 management area and shall adopt one or more controls authorized by
5 section 46-739 to be utilized within the area in order to achieve the
6 ground water management objectives specified in the plan. Such an order
7 shall include a geographic and stratigraphic definition of the area. The
8 boundaries and controls shall take into account any considerations
9 brought forth at the hearing and administrative factors directly
10 affecting the ability of the district to implement and carry out local
11 ground water management.
12 (c) The controls adopted shall not include controls substantially
13 different from those set forth in the notice of the hearing. The area
14 designated by the order shall not include any area not included in the
15 notice of the hearing.
16 (4) Modification of the boundaries of a district-designated
17 management area or dissolution of such an area shall be in accordance
18 with the procedures established in this section. Hearings for such
19 modifications or for dissolution may not be initiated more often than
20 once a year. Hearings for modification of controls may be initiated as
21 often as deemed necessary by the district, and such modifications may be
22 accomplished using the procedure in this section.
23 (5) A district shall, prior to adopting or amending any rules or
24 regulations for a management area, consult with any holders of permits
25 for intentional or incidental underground water storage and recovery
26 issued pursuant to section 46-226.02, 46-233, 46-240, 46-241, 46-242, or
27 46-297.
28 (6) If a ground water management area has been adopted by a district
29 under this section that includes one or more controls authorized by
30 subdivision (1)(f) or (1)(m) of section 46-739, the district may request
31 that the department Department of Natural Resources to conduct an
-183-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 evaluation to determine if an immediate stay should be placed on the
2 issuance of new surface water natural-flow appropriations in the area,
3 river basin, subbasin, or reach of the management area, and the
4 department may determine that the stay is in the public interest. The
5 stay may include provisions for exceptions to be granted for beneficial
6 uses as described in subsection (3) of section 46-714 or for a project
7 that provides hydrological benefit to the area of the stay and may
8 include provisions that the stay may be rescinded based on new or
9 additional information that may become available.
10 Sec. 171. Section 46-713, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-713 (1)(a) By January 1 of each year beginning in 2006 and except
13 as otherwise provided in this section and section 46-720, the department
14 Department of Natural Resources shall complete an evaluation of the
15 expected long-term availability of hydrologically connected water
16 supplies for both existing and new surface water uses and existing and
17 new ground water uses in each of the state's river basins and shall issue
18 a report that describes the results of the evaluation. For purposes of
19 the evaluation and the report, a river basin may be divided into two or
20 more subbasins or reaches. A river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an
21 integrated management plan has been or is being developed pursuant to
22 sections 46-715 to 46-717 or pursuant to section 46-719 shall not be
23 evaluated unless it is being reevaluated as provided in subsection (2) of
24 this section. For each river basin, subbasin, or reach evaluated, the
25 report shall describe (i) the nature and extent of use of both surface
26 water and ground water in each river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the
27 geographic area within which the department preliminarily considers
28 surface water and ground water to be hydrologically connected and the
29 criteria used for that determination, and (iii) the extent to which the
30 then-current uses affect available near-term and long-term water
31 supplies. River basins, subbasins, and reaches designated as
-184-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 overappropriated in accordance with subsection (4) of this section shall
2 not be evaluated by the department. The department is not required to
3 perform an annual evaluation for a river basin, subbasin, or reach during
4 the four years following a status change in such river basin, subbasin,
5 or reach under subsection (12) of section 46-714.
6 (b) Based on the information reviewed in the evaluation process, the
7 department shall arrive at a preliminary conclusion for each river basin,
8 subbasin, and reach evaluated as to whether such river basin, subbasin,
9 or reach presently is fully appropriated without the initiation of
10 additional uses. The department shall also determine if and how such
11 preliminary conclusion would change if no additional legal constraints
12 were imposed on future development of hydrologically connected surface
13 water and ground water and reasonable projections are made about the
14 extent and location of future development in such river basin, subbasin,
15 or reach.
16 (c) In addition to the conclusion about whether a river basin,
17 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the department shall include in
18 the report, for informational purposes only, a summary of relevant data
19 provided by any interested party concerning the social, economic, and
20 environmental impacts of additional hydrologically connected surface
21 water and ground water uses on resources that are dependent on streamflow
22 or ground water levels but are not protected by appropriations or
23 regulations.
24 (d) In preparing the report, the department shall rely on the best
25 scientific data, information, and methodologies readily available to
26 ensure that the conclusions and results contained in the report are
27 reliable. In its report, the department shall provide sufficient
28 documentation to allow these data, information, methodologies, and
29 conclusions to be independently replicated and assessed. Upon request by
30 the department, state agencies, natural resources districts, irrigation
31 districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation districts,
-185-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 mutual irrigation companies, canal companies, municipalities, and other
2 water users and stakeholders shall provide relevant data and information
3 in their possession. The department Department of Natural Resources shall
4 specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other
5 information that will be considered for making the preliminary
6 determinations required by this section.
7 (2)(a) The department shall complete a reevaluation of a river
8 basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated management plan has
9 been or is being prepared if the department has reason to believe that a
10 reevaluation might lead to a different determination about whether such
11 river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated or
12 overappropriated. A decision to reevaluate may be reached by the
13 department on its own or in response to a petition filed with the
14 department by any interested person. To be considered sufficient to
15 justify a reevaluation, a petition shall be accompanied by supporting
16 information showing that (i) new scientific data or other information
17 relevant to the determination of whether the river basin, subbasin, or
18 reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated has become available
19 since the last evaluation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii)
20 the department relied on incorrect or incomplete information when the
21 river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated, or (iii) the
22 department erred in its interpretation or application of the information
23 available when the river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated. If
24 a petition determined by the department to be sufficient is filed before
25 July 1 of any year, the reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or
26 reach involved shall be included in the next annual report prepared in
27 accordance with subsection (1) of this section. If any such petition is
28 filed on or after July 1 of any year, the department may defer the
29 reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved until the
30 second annual report after such filing.
31 (b) If the reevaluation results in a different determination by the
-186-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 department, then (i) the department shall notify, by certified mail, the
2 affected natural resources districts and any irrigation district, public
3 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
4 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
5 subbasin, or reach of the preliminary change in the determination and
6 (ii) the department shall hold one or more public hearings not more than
7 ninety days after the publication of the notice required in subdivision
8 (b)(i) of this subsection. Notice of the hearings shall be provided in
9 the same manner as the notice required in subsection (1) of section
10 46-714. Any interested person may appear at the hearing and present
11 written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the appropriation
12 status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
13 (c) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subdivision (b)
14 of this subsection, the department shall notify the appropriate natural
15 resources districts of the department's final determination with respect
16 to the appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
17 (3) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed fully
18 appropriated if the department determines based upon its evaluation
19 conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and information
20 presented at the hearing pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714
21 that then-current uses of hydrologically connected surface water and
22 ground water in the river basin, subbasin, or reach cause or will in the
23 reasonably foreseeable future cause (a) the surface water supply to be
24 insufficient to sustain over the long term the beneficial or useful
25 purposes for which existing natural-flow or storage appropriations were
26 granted and the beneficial or useful purposes for which, at the time of
27 approval, any existing instream appropriation was granted, (b) the
28 streamflow to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the
29 beneficial uses from wells constructed in aquifers dependent on recharge
30 from the river or stream involved, or (c) reduction in the flow of a
31 river or stream sufficient to cause noncompliance by Nebraska with an
-187-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 interstate compact or decree, other formal state contract or agreement,
2 or applicable state or federal laws.
3 (4)(a) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed
4 overappropriated if, on July 16, 2004, the river basin, subbasin, or
5 reach is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among three or
6 more states and if, prior to such date, the department has declared a
7 moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in such
8 river basin, subbasin, or reach and has requested each natural resources
9 district with jurisdiction in the affected area in such river basin,
10 subbasin, or reach either (i) to close or to continue in effect a
11 previously adopted closure of all or part of such river basin, subbasin,
12 or reach to the issuance of additional water well permits in accordance
13 with subdivision (1)(k) of section 46-656.25 as such section existed
14 prior to July 16, 2004, or (ii) to temporarily suspend or to continue in
15 effect a temporary suspension, previously adopted pursuant to section
16 46-656.28 as such section existed prior to July 16, 2004, on the drilling
17 of new water wells in all or part of such river basin, subbasin, or
18 reach.
19 (b) Within sixty days after July 16, 2004, the department shall
20 designate which river basins, subbasins, or reaches are overappropriated.
21 The designation shall include a description of the geographic area within
22 which the department has determined that surface water and ground water
23 are hydrologically connected and the criteria used to make such
24 determination.
25 Sec. 172. Section 46-714, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 46-714 (1) Whenever the department Department of Natural Resources
28 makes a preliminary determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach
29 not previously designated as overappropriated and not previously
30 determined to be fully appropriated has become fully appropriated, the
31 department shall place an immediate stay on the issuance of any new
-188-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations in such river basin,
2 subbasin, or reach. The department shall also provide prompt notice of
3 such preliminary determination to all licensed water well contractors in
4 the state and to each natural resources district that encompasses any of
5 the geographic area involved. Such notice to natural resources districts
6 shall be by certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the manager
7 of the natural resources district or his or her designee and shall
8 include the signature of the director Director of Natural Resources.
9 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by the natural resources
10 district, there shall be a stay on issuance of water well construction
11 permits in the geographic area preliminarily determined by the department
12 to include hydrologically connected surface water and ground water in
13 such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The department shall also notify
14 the public of the preliminary determination that the river basin,
15 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and of the affected geographic
16 area. Such notice shall be provided by publication once each week for
17 three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of statewide
18 circulation and in such other newspaper or newspapers as are deemed
19 appropriate by the department to provide general circulation in the river
20 basin, subbasin, or reach.
21 (2) If the department preliminarily determines a river basin,
22 subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated and has identified the
23 existence of hydrologically connected surface water and ground water in
24 such river basin, subbasin, or reach, stays shall also be imposed:
25 (a) On the construction of any new water well in the area covered by
26 the determination unless a permit with conditions imposed by the natural
27 resources district has been issued prior to the determination. Such
28 conditions shall meet the objectives of subsection (4) of section 46-715
29 and may include, but are not limited to, conditions in accordance with
30 subsection (6) of section 46-739. Any well constructed pursuant to such
31 permit shall be completed in accordance with section 46-738; and
-189-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 (b) On the use of an existing water well or an existing surface
2 water appropriation in the affected area to increase the number of acres
3 historically irrigated.
4 Such additional stays shall begin ten days after the first
5 publication, in a newspaper of statewide circulation, of the notice of
6 the preliminary determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is
7 fully appropriated.
8 (3) Exceptions to the stays imposed pursuant to subsection (1), (2),
9 (8), or (9) of this section shall exist for (a) test holes, (b)
10 dewatering wells with an intended use of one year or less, (c) monitoring
11 wells, (d) wells constructed pursuant to a ground water remediation plan
12 under the Environmental Protection Act, (e) water wells designed and

1 district, to the extent permitted by the applicable natural resources
2 district, increases in ground water irrigated acres that result from the
3 use of water wells that were permitted prior to the effective date of the
4 determination made in subsection (1) of this section and completed in
5 accordance with section 46-738 but were not used for irrigation prior to
6 that effective date, (l) to the extent permitted by the applicable
7 natural resources district, increases in ground water irrigated acres
8 that result from the use of water wells that are constructed after the
9 effective date of the stay in accordance with a permit granted by that
10 natural resources district prior to the effective date of the stay, (m)
11 surface water uses for which temporary public-use construction permits
12 are issued pursuant to subsection (8) of section 46-233, (n) surface

17 Water Transfers Permit Act prior to the effective date of the stay.
18 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any stay imposed
19 pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall remain in
20 effect for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach until the
21 department has made a final determination regarding whether the river
22 basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and, if the department's
23 final determination is that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
24 appropriated, shall remain in effect as provided in subsection (11) of
25 this section. Within the time period between the dates of the preliminary
26 and final determinations, the department and the affected natural
27 resources districts shall consult with any irrigation district,
28 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, mutual
29 irrigation company, canal company, or municipality that relies on water
30 from the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and with other water
31 users and stakeholders as deemed appropriate by the department or the
-191-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 natural resources districts. The department shall also hold one or more
2 public hearings not more than ninety days after the first publication of
3 the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. Notice of the
4 hearings shall be provided in the same manner as the notice required by
5 such subsection. Any interested person may appear at such hearing and
6 present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
7 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach, the
8 department's preliminary conclusions about the extent of the area within
9 which the surface water and ground water supplies for the river basin,
10 subbasin, or reach are determined to be hydrologically connected, and
11 whether the stays on new uses should be terminated.
12 (5) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subsection (4)
13 of this section, the department shall notify the appropriate natural
14 resources districts of the department's final determination with respect
15 to the appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach. If
16 the final determination is that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is
17 fully appropriated, the department, at the same time, shall (a) decide
18 whether to continue or to terminate the stays on new surface water uses
19 and on increases in the number of surface water irrigated acres and (b)
20 designate the geographic area within which the department considers
21 surface water and ground water to be hydrologically connected in the
22 river basin, subbasin, or reach and describe the methods and criteria
23 used in making that determination. The department shall provide notice of
24 its decision to continue or terminate the stays in the same manner as the
25 notice required by subsection (1) of this section.
26 (6) Within ninety days after a final determination by the department
27 that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, an affected
28 natural resources district may hold one or more public hearings on the
29 question of whether the stays on the issuance of new water well permits,
30 on the construction of new water wells, or on increases in ground water
31 irrigated acres should be terminated. Notice of the hearings shall be
-192-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 published as provided in section 46-743.
2 (7) Within forty-five days after a natural resources district's
3 final hearing pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the natural
4 resources district shall decide (a) whether to terminate the stay on new
5 water wells in all or part of the natural resources district subject to
6 the stay and (b) whether to terminate the stay on increases in ground
7 water irrigated acres. If the natural resources district decides not to
8 terminate the stay on new water wells in any geographic area, it shall
9 also decide whether to exempt from such stay the construction of water
10 wells for which permits were issued prior to the issuance of the stay but
11 for which construction had not begun prior to issuance of the stay. If
12 construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior to the
13 stay is allowed, all permits that were valid when the stay went into
14 effect shall be extended by a time period equal to the length of the
15 stay.
16 (8) Whenever the department designates a river basin, subbasin, or
17 reach as overappropriated, each previously declared moratorium on the
18 issuance of new surface water appropriations in the river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach shall continue in effect. The department shall also
20 provide prompt notice of such designation to all licensed water well
21 contractors in the state and to each natural resources district that
22 encompasses any of the geographic area involved. Immediately upon receipt
23 of such notice by a natural resources district, there shall be a stay on
24 the issuance of new water well construction permits in any portion of
25 such natural resources district that is within the hydrologically
26 connected area designated by the department. The department shall also
27 notify the public of its designation of such river basin, subbasin, or
28 reach as overappropriated and of the geographic area involved in such
29 designation. Such notice shall be published once each week for three
30 consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of statewide circulation and
31 in such other newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the department to

2 (9) Beginning ten days after the first publication of notice under
3 subsection (8) of this section in a newspaper of statewide circulation,
4 there shall also be stays (a) on the construction of any new water well
5 in the hydrologically connected area if such construction has not
6 commenced prior to such date and if no permit for construction of the
7 water well has been issued previously by either the department or the
8 natural resources district, (b) on the use of an existing water well in
9 the hydrologically connected area to increase the number of acres
10 historically irrigated, and (c) on the use of an existing surface water
11 appropriation to increase the number of acres historically irrigated in
12 the affected area.
13 (10) Within ninety days after a designation by the department of a
14 river basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, a natural resources
15 district that encompasses any of the hydrologically connected area
16 designated by the department may hold one or more public hearings on the
17 question of whether to terminate the stays on (a) the construction of new
18 water wells within all or part of its portion of the hydrologically
19 connected area, (b) the issuance of new water well construction permits
20 in such area, or (c) the increase in ground water irrigated acres in such
21 area. Notice of any hearing for such purpose shall be provided pursuant
22 to section 46-743. Prior to the scheduling of a natural resources
23 district hearing on the question of whether to terminate any such stay,
24 the department and the affected natural resources district shall consult
25 with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public power and
26 irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
27 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
29 appropriate by the department or the natural resources district.
30 (11) Any stay issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect
31 until (a) the stay has been terminated pursuant to subsection (5), (7),
-194-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 or (10) of this section, (b) an integrated management plan for the
2 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the
3 department and the affected natural resources districts and has taken
4 effect, (c) an integrated management plan for the affected river basin,
5 subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Interrelated Water Review
6 Board and has taken effect, (d) the department has completed a
7 reevaluation pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-713 and has
8 determined that the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach is not fully
9 appropriated or overappropriated, or (e) the stay expires pursuant to
10 this subsection. Such stay may be imposed initially for not more than
11 three years following the department's designation of the river basin,
12 subbasin, or reach as overappropriated or the department's final
13 determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
14 appropriated and may be extended thereafter on an annual basis by
15 agreement of the department and the affected natural resources district
16 for not more than two additional years if necessary to allow the
17 development, adoption, and implementation of an integrated management
18 plan pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-719.
19 (12)(a) For purposes of this subsection, (i) a status change occurs
20 when a preliminary or final determination that a river basin, subbasin,
21 or reach is fully appropriated is reversed by the department or by
22 judicial determination and such river basin, subbasin, or reach is
23 determined not to be fully appropriated and (ii) the hydrologically
24 connected area means the geographic area within which the department
25 considers surface water and ground water in such river basin, subbasin,
26 or reach to be hydrologically connected.
27 (b) If a status change occurs, any stays previously in force by the
28 department or affected natural resources districts shall remain in force
29 until the stays imposed under this subsection are in place and the
30 department shall place an immediate stay on the issuance of any new
31 natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations in the river basin,
-195-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 subbasin, or reach. The department shall also provide prompt notice of
2 the status change in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
3 Immediately upon receipt of the notice by the affected natural resources
4 district, there shall be stays imposed as set forth in subsections (1)
5 and (2) of this section, subject to the exceptions set forth in
6 subsection (3) of this section. The stays imposed pursuant to this
7 subsection shall remain in effect within each affected natural resources
8 district until such district adopts rules and regulations in accordance
9 with subdivision (c), (d), or (e) of this subsection.
10 (c) Upon receipt of notice of a status change, each affected natural
11 resources district shall adopt rules and regulations within one hundred
12 twenty days after receipt of such notice for the prioritization and
13 granting of water well permits within the hydrologically connected area
14 for the four-year period following the status change. Nothing in this
15 subsection shall be construed to supersede the authority provided to
16 natural resources districts under subsection (2) of section 46-707 and
17 subdivisions (1)(f) and (1)(m) of section 46-739.
18 (d) The rules and regulations adopted by each affected natural
19 resources district in accordance with subdivision (c) of this subsection
20 shall (i) allow a limited number of total new ground water irrigated
21 acres annually, (ii) be created with the purpose of maintaining the
22 status of not fully appropriated based on the most recent basin
23 determination, (iii) be for a term of not less than four years, and (iv)
24 limit the number of new permits so that total new ground water irrigated
25 acres do not exceed the number set in the rules and regulations. The
26 department shall approve the proposed new number of ground water
27 irrigated acres within sixty days after approval by the natural resources
28 district if such district meets the conditions set forth in subdivision
29 (d)(ii) of this subsection, based on the most recent basin determination.
30 (e) If the proposed new number of acres is not approved by the
31 department within the applicable time period as provided in subdivision
-196-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 (d) of this subsection, the affected natural resources districts shall
2 adopt rules and regulations that allow water well permits to be issued
3 that will result in no more than two thousand five hundred irrigated
4 acres or that will result in an increase of not more than twenty percent
5 of all historically irrigated acres within the hydrologically connected
6 area of each natural resources district within the affected river basin,
7 subbasin, or reach, whichever is less, for each calendar year of the
8 four-year period following the date of the determination described in
9 this subsection. Each affected natural resources district may, after the
10 initial four-year period has expired, annually determine whether water
11 well permit limitations should continue and may enforce such limitations.
12 (f) During the four-year period following the status change, the
13 department shall ensure that any new appropriation granted will not cause
14 the basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated based on the most
15 recent basin determination. The department, pursuant to its rules and
16 regulations, shall not issue new natural flow surface water
17 appropriations for irrigation, within the river basin, subbasin, or reach
18 affected by the status change, that will result in a net increase of more
19 than eight hundred thirty-four irrigated acres in each natural resources
20 district during each calendar year of the four-year period following the
21 date of the determination described in this subsection.
22 Sec. 173. Section 46-715, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 46-715 (1)(a) Whenever the department Department of Natural
25 Resources has designated a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
26 overappropriated or has made a final determination that a river basin,
27 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the natural resources districts
28 encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach and the department
29 shall jointly develop an integrated management plan for such river basin,
30 subbasin, or reach. The plan shall be completed, adopted, and take effect
31 within three years after such designation or final determination unless
-197-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 the department and the natural resources districts jointly agree to an
2 extension of not more than two additional years.
3 (b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin,
4 subbasin, or reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or
5 has not been finally determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly
6 with the department, develop an integrated management plan for such river
7 basin, subbasin, or reach located within the district. The district shall
8 notify the department of its intention to develop an integrated
9 management plan which shall be developed and adopted according to
10 sections 46-715 to 46-717 and subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-718.
11 The objective of an integrated management plan under this subdivision is
12 to manage such river basin, subbasin, or reach to achieve and sustain a
13 balance between water uses and water supplies for the long term. If a
14 district develops an integrated management plan under this subdivision
15 and the department subsequently determines the affected river basin,
16 subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated, the department and the
17 affected natural resources district may amend the integrated management
18 plan.
19 (2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects of
20 existing and potential new water uses on existing surface water
21 appropriators and ground water users shall be considered. An integrated
22 management plan shall include the following: (a) Clear goals and
23 objectives with a purpose of sustaining a balance between water uses and
24 water supplies so that the economic viability, social and environmental
25 health, safety, and welfare of the river basin, subbasin, or reach can be
26 achieved and maintained for both the near term and the long term; (b) a
27 map clearly delineating the geographic area subject to the integrated
28 management plan; (c) one or more of the ground water controls authorized
29 for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant to section 46-739;
30 (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized for adoption by
31 the department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a plan to gather and
-198-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 evaluate data, information, and methodologies that could be used to
2 implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase understanding of the
3 surface water and hydrologically connected ground water system, and test
4 the validity of the conclusions and information upon which the integrated
5 management plan is based. The plan may also provide for utilization of
6 any applicable incentive programs authorized by law. Nothing in the
7 integrated management plan for a fully appropriated river basin,
8 subbasin, or reach shall require a natural resources district to regulate
9 ground water uses in place at the time of the department's preliminary
10 determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
11 appropriated, unless such regulation is necessary to carry out the goals
12 and objectives of a basin-wide plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a
13 natural resources district may voluntarily adopt such regulations. The
14 applicable natural resources district may decide to include all water
15 users within the district boundary in an integrated management plan.
16 (3) In order to provide a process for economic development
17 opportunities and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin,
18 or reach, the integrated management plan shall include clear and
19 transparent procedures to track depletions and gains to streamflows
20 resulting from new, retired, or other changes to uses within the river
21 basin, subbasin, or reach. The procedures shall:
22 (a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the best
23 available information, data, and science;
24 (b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized to
25 estimate depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes
26 location, amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to
27 new uses;
28 (c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not have
29 more than a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground
30 water users;
31 (d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and the
-199-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share information
2 on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting water use in
3 the river basin, subbasin, or reach;
4 (e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available to
5 mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
6 interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use
7 management, and use retirement;
8 (f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans after
9 consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
10 districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts,
11 municipalities, other political subdivisions, and other water users to
12 make water available for offset to enhance and encourage economic
13 development opportunities and economic sustainability in the river basin,
14 subbasin, or reach; and
15 (g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses shall
16 take to apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.
17 Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment of an
18 integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.
19 (4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed for
20 adoption in the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1) of
21 this section shall, when considered together and with any applicable
22 incentive programs, (a) be consistent with the goals and objectives of
23 the plan, (b) be sufficient to ensure that the state will remain in
24 compliance with applicable state and federal laws and with any applicable
25 interstate water compact or decree or other formal state contract or
26 agreement pertaining to surface water or ground water use or supplies,
27 and (c) protect the ground water users whose water wells are dependent on
28 recharge from the river or stream involved and the surface water
29 appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion caused by
30 surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a river
31 basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily
-200-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 determined to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713,
2 after the date of such designation or preliminary determination.
3 (5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
4 overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more
5 natural resources districts, the department and the affected natural
6 resources districts shall jointly develop a basin-wide plan for the area
7 designated as overappropriated. Such plan shall be developed using the
8 consultation and collaboration process described in subdivision (b) of
9 this subsection, shall be developed concurrently with the development of
10 the integrated management plan required pursuant to subsections (1)
11 through (4) of this section, and shall be designed to achieve, in the
12 incremental manner described in subdivision (d) of this subsection, the
13 goals and objectives described in subsection (2) of this section. The
14 basin-wide plan shall be adopted after hearings by the department and the
15 affected natural resources districts.
16 (b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
17 overappropriated and subject to this subsection, the department and each
18 natural resources district encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or
19 reach shall jointly develop an integrated management plan for such river
20 basin, subbasin, or reach pursuant to subsections (1) through (4) of this
21 section. Each integrated management plan for a river basin, subbasin, or
22 reach subject to this subsection shall be consistent with any basin-wide
23 plan developed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this subsection. Such
24 integrated management plan shall be developed after consultation and
25 collaboration with irrigation districts, reclamation districts, public
26 power and irrigation districts, mutual irrigation companies, canal
27 companies, and municipalities that rely on water from within the affected
28 area and that, after being notified of the commencement of the plan
29 development process, indicate in writing their desire to participate in
30 such process. In addition, the department or the affected natural
31 resources districts may include designated representatives of other
-201-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 stakeholders. If agreement is reached by all parties involved in such
2 consultation and collaboration process, the department and each natural
3 resources district shall adopt the agreed-upon integrated management
4 plan. If agreement cannot be reached by all parties involved, the
5 integrated management plan shall be developed and adopted by the
6 department and the affected natural resources district pursuant to
7 sections 46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board
8 pursuant to section 46-719.
9 (c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
10 shall identify the overall difference between the current and fully
11 appropriated levels of development. Such determination shall take into
12 account cyclical supply, including drought, identify the portion of the
13 overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
14 development that is due to conservation measures, and identify the
15 portions of the overall difference between the current and fully
16 appropriated levels of development that are due to water use initiated
17 prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated on or after such date.
18 (d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
19 shall adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives
20 identified under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following
21 steps:
22 (i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact of
23 streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water
24 wells constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to
25 the extent those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1,
26 1997, and, unless an interstate cooperative agreement for such river
27 basin, subbasin, or reach is no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow
28 depletions that would cause noncompliance by Nebraska with such
29 interstate cooperative agreement. During the first increment, the
30 department and the affected natural resources districts shall also pursue
31 voluntary efforts, subject to the availability of funds, to offset any
-202-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 increase in streamflow depletive effects that occur after July 1, 1997,
2 but are caused by ground water uses initiated prior to such date. The
3 department and the affected natural resources districts may also use
4 other appropriate and authorized measures for such purpose;
5 (ii) The department and the affected natural resources districts may
6 amend an integrated management plan subject to this subsection (5) as
7 necessary based on an annual review of the progress being made toward
8 achieving the goals for that increment;
9 (iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated
10 management plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten
11 years after the adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated
12 management plan pursuant to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the
13 department and the affected natural resources district shall conduct a
14 technical analysis of the actions taken in such increment to determine
15 the progress towards meeting the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to
16 subsection (2) of this section. The analysis shall include an examination
17 of (A) available supplies and changes in long-term availability, (B) the
18 effects of conservation practices and natural causes, including, but not
19 limited to, drought, and (C) the effects of the plan on reducing the
20 overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
21 development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of this section. The
22 analysis shall determine whether a subsequent increment is necessary in
23 the integrated management plan to meet the goals and objectives adopted
24 pursuant to subsection (2) of this section and reduce the overall
25 difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
26 development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of this section;
27 (iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii) of this
28 subsection, the department and the affected natural resources districts,
29 utilizing the consultative and collaborative process described in
30 subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall if necessary identify goals for
31 a subsequent increment of the integrated management plan. Subsequent
-203-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 increments shall be completed, adopted, and take effect not more than ten
2 years after adoption of the previous increment; and
3 (v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii)
4 through (iv) of this subsection shall be repeated until the department
5 and the affected natural resources districts agree that the goals and
6 objectives identified pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have
7 been met and the overall difference between the current and fully
8 appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of
9 this section has been addressed so that the river basin, subbasin, or
10 reach has returned to a fully appropriated condition.
11 (6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
12 fully appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure
13 that the state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a
14 formal state contract or agreement, the department, in consultation with
15 the affected districts, shall forecast on an annual basis the maximum
16 amount of water that may be available from streamflow for beneficial use
17 in the short term and long term in order to comply with the requirement
18 of subdivision (4)(b) of this section. This forecast shall be made by
19 January 1, 2008, and each January 1 thereafter.
20 Sec. 174. Section 46-716, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-716 (1) The surface water controls that may be included in an
23 integrated management plan and may be adopted by the department
24 Department of Natural Resources are: (a) Increased monitoring and
25 enforcement of surface water diversion rates and amounts diverted
26 annually; (b) the prohibition or limitation of additional surface water
27 appropriations; (c) requirements for surface water appropriators to apply
28 or utilize reasonable conservation measures consistent with good
29 husbandry and other requirements of section 46-231 and consistent with
30 reasonable reliance by other surface water or ground water users on
31 return flows or on seepage to the aquifer; and (d) other reasonable
-204-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 restrictions on surface water use which are consistent with the intent of
2 section 46-715 and the requirements of section 46-231.
3 (2) If during the development of the integrated management plan the
4 department determines that surface water appropriators should be required
5 to apply or utilize conservation measures or that other reasonable
6 restrictions on surface water use need to be imposed, the department's
7 portion of the integrated management plan shall allow the affected
8 surface water appropriators and surface water project sponsors a
9 reasonable amount of time, not to exceed one hundred eighty days unless
10 extended by the department, to identify the conservation measures to be
11 applied or utilized, to develop a schedule for such application and
12 utilization, and to comment on any other proposed restrictions.
13 Sec. 175. Section 46-717, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-717 (1) In developing an integrated management plan, the
16 department Department of Natural Resources and the affected natural
17 resources districts shall utilize the best scientific data and other
18 information available and shall review and consider any rules and
19 regulations in effect in any existing ground water management area that
20 encompasses all or part of the geographic area to be encompassed by the
21 plan. Consideration shall be given to the applicable scientific data and
22 other information relied upon by the department in preparing the annual
23 report required by section 46-713 and to other types of data and
24 information that may be deemed appropriate by the department. The
25 department, after seeking input from the affected natural resources
26 districts, shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific
27 data and other information that will be considered in developing an
28 integrated management plan. The natural resources districts shall adopt
29 similar rules and regulations specifying the types of scientific data and
30 other information necessary for purposes of this section. Existing
31 research, data, studies, or any other relevant information which has been

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 compiled by or is in possession of other state or federal agencies, other
2 natural resources districts, and other political subdivisions within the
3 State of Nebraska shall be utilized. State agencies and political
4 subdivisions shall furnish information or data upon request of the
5 department or any affected natural resources district. Neither the
6 department nor the natural resources districts shall be required to
7 conduct new research or to develop new computer models to prepare an
8 integrated management plan, but such new research may be conducted or new
9 computer models developed within the limits of available funding if the
10 additional information is desired by the department or the affected
11 natural resources districts.
12 (2) During preparation of an integrated management plan for a fully
13 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach or of an integrated
14 management plan under subdivision (1)(b) of section 46-715, the
15 department and the affected natural resources districts shall consult
16 with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public power and
17 irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
18 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
20 appropriate by the department or by the affected natural resources
21 districts. They shall also actively solicit public comments and opinions
22 through public meetings and other means.
23 Sec. 176. Section 46-718, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-718 (1) If the department Department of Natural Resources and the
26 affected natural resources districts preparing an integrated management
27 plan reach agreement on (a) the proposed goals and objectives of the plan
28 for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, (b) the proposed
29 geographic area to be subject to controls, and (c) the surface water and
30 ground water controls and any incentive programs that are proposed for
31 adoption and implementation in the river basin, subbasin, or reach, they

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 shall schedule one or more public hearings to take testimony on the
2 proposed integrated management plan and the proposed controls. Such
3 hearings shall be held within forty-five days after reaching agreement
4 and within or in reasonable proximity to the area to be affected by
5 implementation of the integrated management plan. Notice of such hearings
6 shall be published as provided in section 46-743. The costs of publishing
7 the notice shall be shared between the department and the affected
8 natural resources districts. All interested persons may appear at the
9 hearings and present testimony or provide other evidence relevant to the
10 issues being considered.
11 (2) Within sixty days after the final hearing under this section,
12 the department and the affected natural resources districts shall jointly
13 decide whether to implement the plan proposed, with or without
14 modifications, and whether to adopt and implement the surface water and
15 ground water controls and incentive programs proposed in the plan. If the
16 department and the natural resources districts agree to implement the
17 plan and to adopt and implement the proposed controls, the natural
18 resources districts shall by order designate a ground water management
19 area for integrated management or, if the geographic area subject to the
20 integrated management plan is already in a ground water management area,
21 the order shall designate an integrated management subarea for that area.
22 The order shall include a geographic and stratigraphic definition of the
23 ground water management area or integrated management subarea and shall
24 adopt the controls in the integrated management plan that are authorized
25 for adoption by the natural resources district pursuant to section
26 46-739. The department shall by order adopt the controls in the
27 integrated management plan that are authorized for adoption by the
28 department pursuant to section 46-716. Neither the controls adopted by
29 the district nor those adopted by the department shall include controls
30 substantially different from those set forth in the notice of hearing.

3 the area proposed to be subject to the controls in the plan. The
4 department and the natural resources district shall each cause a copy of
5 its order to be published in the manner provided in section 46-744.
6 (3) If at any time during the development of a basin-wide plan or an
7 integrated management plan either the department or the affected natural
8 resources districts conclude that the parties will be unable to reach a
9 timely agreement on the basin-wide plan or on (a) the goals and
10 objectives of the integrated management plan for the affected river
11 basin, subbasin, or reach, (b) the geographic area to be subject to
12 controls, or (c) the surface water or ground water controls or any
13 incentive programs to be proposed for adoption and implementation in the
14 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Governor shall be notified
15 and the dispute shall be submitted to the Interrelated Water Review Board
16 as provided in subsection (2) of section 46-719.
17 Sec. 177. Section 46-719, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
18 amended to read:
19 46-719 (1)(a) The Interrelated Water Review Board is created for the
20 purposes stated in subsections (2) through (5) of this section. The board
21 shall consist of five members. The board, when appointed and convened,
22 shall continue in existence only until it has resolved a dispute referred
23 to it pursuant to such subsections. The Governor shall appoint and
24 convene the board within forty-five days of being notified of the need to
25 resolve a dispute. The board shall be chaired by the Governor or his or
26 her designee, which designee shall be knowledgeable concerning surface
27 water and ground water issues. The Governor shall appoint one additional
28 member of his or her choosing and shall appoint the other three members
29 of the board from a list of no fewer than six nominees provided by the
30 Nebraska Natural Resources Commission within twenty days after request by
31 the Governor for a list of nominees.

2025 2025
1 (b) Not more than two members of the board shall reside in the
2 geographic area involved in the dispute. A person is not eligible for
3 membership on the board if the decisions to be made by the board would or
4 could cause financial benefit or detriment to the person, a member of his
5 or her immediate family, or a business with which the person is
6 associated, unless such benefit or detriment is indistinguishable from
7 the effects of such action on the public generally or a broad segment of
8 the public. The board shall be subject to the Open Meetings Act.
9 (c) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, action
10 may be taken by a vote of three of the board's five members. For purposes
11 of subsections (4) and (5) of this section, action may be taken only by a
12 vote of at least four of the board's five members.
13 (2)(a) If the department Department of Natural Resources and the
14 affected natural resources districts cannot resolve disputes over the
15 content of a basin-wide plan or an integrated management plan by
16 utilizing the process described in sections 46-715 to 46-718, the
17 Governor shall be notified and the dispute submitted to the Interrelated
18 Water Review Board. When the board has been appointed and convened to
19 resolve disputes over a basin-wide plan, the department and each affected
20 district shall present their proposed basin-wide plans to the board. When
21 the board has been convened to resolve disputes over an integrated
22 management plan, the department and each affected natural resources
23 district shall present their (i) proposed goals and objectives for the
24 integrated management plan, (ii) proposed geographic area to be subject
25 to controls, and (iii) proposed surface water and ground water controls
26 and any proposed incentive program for adoption and implementation in the
27 river basin, subbasin, or reach involved. The department and each
28 affected natural resources district shall also be given adequate
29 opportunity to comment on the proposals made by the other parties to the
30 dispute.
31 (b) When the Interrelated Water Review Board concludes that the
-209-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 issues in dispute have been fully presented and commented upon by the
2 parties to the dispute, which conclusion shall be made not more than
3 forty-five days after the board is convened, the board shall select the
4 proposals or portions of proposals that the board will consider for
5 adoption and shall schedule one or more public hearings to take testimony
6 on the selected proposals. The hearings shall be held within forty-five
7 days after the board's selection of proposals to consider for adoption
8 and shall be within or in reasonable proximity to the area that would be
9 affected by implementation of any of the proposals to be considered at
10 the hearings. Notice of the hearings shall be published as provided in
11 section 46-743. The cost of publishing the notice shall be shared by the
12 department and the affected natural resources districts. All interested
13 persons may appear at the hearings and present testimony or provide other
14 evidence relevant to the issues being considered.
15 (c) Within forty-five days after the final hearing pursuant to
16 subdivision (b) of this subsection, the Interrelated Water Review Board
17 shall by order, as applicable, adopt a basin-wide plan or an integrated
18 management plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and, in
19 the case of an integrated management plan, shall designate a ground water
20 management area for integrated management or an integrated management
21 subarea for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. An integrated
22 management plan shall be consistent with subsection (2) of section
23 46-715, and the surface water and ground water controls and any
24 applicable incentive programs adopted as part of that plan shall be
25 consistent with subsection (4) of section 46-715. The controls adopted by
26 the board shall not be substantially different from those described in
27 the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water management
28 area or an integrated management subarea shall not include any area that
29 was not identified in the notice of the hearing as within the area
30 proposed to be subject to the controls in the plan.
31 (d) The order adopted under this subsection shall be published in
-210-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 the manner prescribed in section 46-744.
2 (e) Surface water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review
3 Board shall be implemented and enforced by the department. Ground water
4 controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
5 implemented and enforced by the affected natural resources districts.
6 (3) Whether an integrated management plan is adopted pursuant to
7 section 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board pursuant to
8 subsection (2) of this section, the department or a natural resources
9 district responsible in part for implementation and enforcement of an
10 integrated management plan may propose modification of the goals or
11 objectives of that plan, of the area subject to the plan, or of the
12 surface water controls, ground water controls, or incentive programs
13 adopted to implement the plan. The department and the affected natural
14 resources districts shall utilize the procedures in sections 46-715 to
15 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement on and to adopt and implement
16 proposed modifications. If agreement on such modifications cannot be
17 achieved utilizing those procedures, either the department or an affected
18 natural resources district may notify the Governor of the dispute. The
19 Interrelated Water Review Board shall be appointed and convened in
20 accordance with subsection (1) of this section to resolve the dispute
21 and, if applicable, to adopt any modifications utilizing the procedures
22 in subsection (2) of this section.
23 (4) The department and the affected natural resources districts may
24 also raise objections concerning the implementation or enforcement of
25 previously adopted surface water or ground water controls. The department
26 and the affected natural resources districts shall utilize the procedures
27 in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement on such
28 implementation or enforcement issues. If agreement on such issues cannot
29 be achieved utilizing such procedures, either the department or an
30 affected natural resources district may notify the Governor of the
31 dispute. The Interrelated Water Review Board shall be appointed and
-211-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 convened in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. After
2 permitting each party to fully express its reasons for its position on
3 the disputed issues, the board may either take no action or conclude (a)
4 that one or more parties needs to modify its approach to implementation
5 or enforcement and direct that such modifications take place or (b) that
6 one or more parties either has not made a good faith effort to implement
7 or enforce the portion of the plan or controls for which it is
8 responsible or is unable to fully implement and enforce such portion and
9 that such party's jurisdiction with respect to implementation and
10 enforcement of the plan and controls shall be terminated and reassigned
11 to one or more of the other parties responsible for implementation and
12 enforcement. A decision by the Interrelated Water Review Board to
13 terminate and reassign jurisdiction of any portion of the plan or
14 controls shall take effect immediately upon that decision. Notice of such
15 reassignment shall be published at least once in one or more newspapers
16 as necessary to provide general circulation in the area affected by such
17 reassignment.
18 (5) The board may be reconvened in accordance with subsection (1) of
19 this section at a later date upon request to the Governor by the party
20 for which jurisdiction for implementation and enforcement was terminated
21 if such party desires to have its jurisdiction reinstated, but no such
22 request shall be honored until at least one year after the termination
23 and not more than once per year thereafter. The board may reinstate
24 jurisdiction to that party only upon a clear showing by such party that
25 it is willing and able to fully implement and enforce the plan and any
26 applicable controls. Notice that a party's jurisdiction has been
27 reinstated shall be provided in the same manner that notice of the
28 earlier termination was given.
29 Sec. 178. Section 46-720, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 46-720 (1) The Legislature finds that, prior to July 16, 2004,
-212-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 actions were taken by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed
2 prior to July 1, 2025, and by one or more natural resources districts
3 pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed immediately prior
4 to July 16, 2004 such date, for the purpose of addressing circumstances
5 that are, after July 16, 2004 such date, to be addressed in accordance
6 with sections 46-713 to 46-719. It is the intent of the Legislature that
7 actions taken pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed
8 immediately prior to July 16, 2004, should not be negated and that
9 transition from the authorities and responsibilities granted by such
10 section to those granted by sections 46-713 to 46-719 should occur in as
11 efficient a manner as possible. Such transition shall be therefor
12 governed by subsections (2) through (5) of this section, and all
13 references in such subsections to section 46-656.28 shall be construed to
14 mean section 46-656.28 as such section existed immediately prior to July
15 16, 2004.
16 (2) If, prior to July 16, 2004, (a) a natural resources district
17 requested pursuant to subsection (1) of section 46-656.28 that affected
18 appropriators, affected surface water project sponsors, and the
19 department consult and that studies and a hearing be held but (b) the
20 Director of Natural Resources, as such position existed, had has not made
21 a preliminary determination relative to that request pursuant to
22 subsection (2) of section 46-656.28, no further action on the district's
23 request shall be required of the department. If under the same
24 circumstances a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain water
25 wells has been imposed by the district pursuant to subsection (16) of
26 section 46-656.28 and remains in effect immediately prior to July 16,
27 2004, such temporary suspension shall remain in effect for thirty days
28 after the department issues its first annual report under section 46-713,
29 except that (i) such temporary suspension shall not apply to water wells
30 for which a permit has been obtained pursuant to the Municipal and Rural
31 Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act and (ii) to the extent any
-213-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 such temporary suspension is in effect for all or part of a
2 hydrologically connected area for a river basin, subbasin, or reach
3 designated as overappropriated by the department, such temporary
4 suspension shall remain in effect only until it is superseded by the
5 stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section 46-714. To
6 the extent that any such temporary suspension applies to a geographic
7 area preliminarily considered by the department to have ground water
8 hydrologically connected to the surface water of a fully appropriated
9 river basin, subbasin, or reach, such temporary suspension shall be
10 superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of
11 section 46-714.
12 (3)(a) If prior to July 16, 2004, (i) the director has made a
13 preliminary determination pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28
14 that there is reason to believe that the use of hydrologically connected
15 ground water and surface water in a specific geographic area is
16 contributing to or is in the reasonably foreseeable future likely to
17 contribute to any conflict, dispute, or difficulty listed in such
18 subsection, (ii) the director has not made a determination pursuant to
19 subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint action plan should not
20 be prepared, and (iii) preparation of a joint action plan pursuant to
21 subsections (5) through (9) of such section has not been completed, the
22 geographic area involved shall become subject to sections 46-713 to
23 46-719 on July 16, 2004, and the department need not evaluate such
24 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
25 46-713.
26 (b) For purposes of this subsection and section 46-714 and except as
27 otherwise provided in this section, (i) July 16, 2004, shall result in
28 the imposition in any geographic area subject to this subsection of the
29 stays required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714, (ii) such
30 stays shall be imposed in the manner required by such section, and (iii)
31 July 16, 2004, shall be treated as if it were the date of a departmental
-214-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 preliminary determination pursuant to section 46-713 that such area is a
2 geographic area within which ground water and surface water of a fully
3 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach are hydrologically
4 connected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if a
5 temporary suspension in the drilling of certain new water wells has
6 previously been imposed by the affected natural resources district, (A)
7 the stays on construction of new water wells and on the increase in
8 ground water irrigated acres shall be limited in geographic extent to
9 only that part of the affected area within which the temporary suspension
10 was in effect unless the director determines that inclusion of additional
11 area is necessary because ground water and surface water are
12 hydrologically connected in such additional area and (B) the stays on
13 construction of certain new water wells shall not apply to a water well
14 constructed in accordance with the terms of a water well construction
15 permit approved by the district prior to July 16, 2004, unless such well
16 was subject to the district's temporary suspension. If, prior to July 16,
17 2004, the director has held a hearing on a report issued pursuant to
18 subsection (3) of section 46-656.28 but has not yet determined whether a
19 joint action plan should be prepared, no departmental hearing shall be
20 required pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 before a final
21 determination is made about whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach
22 involved is fully appropriated. If, prior to July 16, 2004, the director
23 has determined pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a
24 joint action plan should be prepared, such determination shall have the
25 same effect as a final departmental determination pursuant to subsection
26 (5) of section 46-714 that the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach
27 is fully appropriated and no separate determination to that effect shall
28 be required. If, after July 16, 2004, the department determines that all
29 or part of the area subject to this subsection is in an overappropriated
30 river basin, subbasin, or reach, that portion of the area shall
31 thereafter be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Ground Water
-215-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Management and Protection Act applicable to an overappropriated river
2 basin, subbasin, or reach and stays that have previously taken effect in
3 accordance with this subsection shall continue in effect as stays for an
4 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach without additional
5 action or publication of notice by the department. Any temporary
6 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells that has been imposed
7 in the geographic area involved by a natural resources district pursuant
8 to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28 prior to July 16, 2004, shall
9 remain in effect until superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to
10 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714.
11 (4) If, prior to July 16, 2004, preparation of a joint action plan
12 has been completed pursuant to subsections (5) through (9) of section
13 46-656.28 but the plan has not yet been adopted pursuant to subsection
14 (11) of such section, the department need not evaluate the affected
15 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
16 46-713. The department and the affected natural resources district shall
17 review the completed joint action plan for its compliance with sections
18 46-715 to 46-717. If the joint action plan is determined to be in
19 compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 or if agreement is reached on
20 the revisions necessary to bring it into such compliance, the department
21 and the district shall adopt the plan and implement the controls as
22 provided in section 46-718. If the joint action plan is determined not to
23 be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 and agreement on the
24 proposed plan or the proposed controls cannot be reached pursuant to
25 section 46-718, section 46-719 shall apply. Except to the extent that any
26 portion of the affected area is designated as all or part of an
27 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach, any temporary
28 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells imposed in the affected
29 geographic area by a natural resources district pursuant to subsection
30 (16) of section 46-656.28 shall remain in effect until (a) the department
31 and the affected district have jointly decided to implement the plan,
-216-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 with or without modifications, and controls have been adopted and taken
2 effect or (b) the Interrelated Water Review Board, pursuant to section
3 46-719, has adopted an integrated management plan for the affected river
4 basin, subbasin, or reach and the controls adopted by the board have
5 taken effect. To the extent that any portion of the affected area is
6 designated as all or part of an overappropriated river basin, subbasin,
7 or reach, any temporary suspension in the drilling of water wells shall
8 be superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of
9 section 46-714.
10 (5) If, before July 16, 2004, a joint action plan has been adopted
11 and implemented pursuant to subsections (10) through (12) of section
12 46-656.28 and is in effect immediately prior to such date, the department
13 need not evaluate the geographic area subject to the plan in the
14 department's first annual report issued pursuant to section 46-713. For
15 purposes of the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act, (a)
16 the plan adopted shall be considered an integrated management plan
17 adopted pursuant to section 46-718, (b) the management area designated
18 shall be considered an integrated management area or subarea designated
19 pursuant to section 46-718, and (c) the controls adopted shall be
20 considered controls adopted pursuant to section 46-718 and shall remain
21 in effect until amended or repealed pursuant to section 46-718 or 46-719.
22 Sec. 179. Section 46-721, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 46-721 Each state agency and political subdivision shall promptly
25 report to the department Department of Environment and Energy any
26 information which indicates that contamination is occurring.
27 Sec. 180. Section 46-722, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-722 If, as a result of information provided pursuant to section
30 46-721 or studies conducted by or otherwise available to the department
31 Department of Environment and Energy and following preliminary
-217-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 investigation, the director Director of Environment and Energy makes a
2 preliminary determination (1) that there is reason to believe that
3 contamination of ground water is occurring or likely to occur in an area
4 of the state in the reasonably foreseeable future and (2) that the
5 natural resources district or districts in which the area is located have
6 not designated a management area or have not implemented adequate
7 controls to prevent such contamination from occurring, the department
8 shall, in cooperation with any appropriate state agency and district,
9 conduct a study to determine the source or sources of the contamination
10 and the area affected by such contamination and shall issue a written
11 report within one year of the initiation of the study. During the study,
12 the department shall consider the relevant water quality portions of the
13 management plan developed by each district pursuant to sections 46-709 to
14 46-711, whether the district has designated a management area
15 encompassing the area studied, and whether the district has adopted any
16 controls for the area.
17 Sec. 181. Section 46-723, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
18 amended to read:
19 46-723 If the director Director of Environment and Energy determines
20 from the study conducted pursuant to section 46-722 that one or more
21 sources of contamination are point sources, he or she shall expeditiously
22 use the procedures authorized in the Environmental Protection Act to
23 stabilize or reduce the level and prevent the increase or spread of such
24 contamination.
25 Sec. 182. Section 46-724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 46-724 If the director Director of Environment and Energy determines
28 from the study conducted pursuant to section 46-722 that one or more
29 sources of contamination are not point sources and if a management area,
30 a purpose of which is protection of water quality, has been established
31 which includes the affected area, the director Director of Environment
-218-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 and Energy shall consider whether to require the district which
2 established the management area to adopt an action plan as provided in
3 sections 46-725 to 46-729.
4 If the director Director of Environment and Energy determines that
5 one or more of the sources are not point sources and if such a management
6 area has not been established or does not include all the affected area,
7 he or she shall, within thirty days after completion of the report
8 required by section 46-722, consult with the district within whose
9 boundaries the area affected by such contamination is located and fix a
10 time and place for a public hearing to consider the report, hear any
11 other evidence, and secure testimony on whether a management area should
12 be designated or whether an existing area should be modified. The hearing
13 shall be held within one hundred twenty days after completion of the
14 report. Notice of the hearing shall be given as provided in section
15 46-743, and the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with such
16 section.
17 At the hearing, all interested persons shall be allowed to appear
18 and present testimony. The Conservation and Survey Division of the
19 University of Nebraska, the Department of Health and Human Services, the
20 Department of Natural Resources, and the appropriate district may offer
21 as evidence any information in their possession which they deem relevant
22 to the purpose of the hearing. After the hearing and after any studies or
23 investigations conducted by or on behalf of the director Director of
24 Environment and Energy as he or she deems necessary, the director shall
25 determine whether a management area shall be designated.
26 Sec. 183. Section 46-725, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
27 amended to read:
28 46-725 (1) When determining whether to designate or modify the
29 boundaries of a management area or to require a district which has
30 established a management area, a purpose of which is protection of water
31 quality, to adopt an action plan for the affected area, the director
-219-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Director of Environment and Energy shall consider:
2 (a) Whether contamination of ground water has occurred or is likely
3 to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future;
4 (b) Whether ground water users, including, but not limited to,
5 domestic, municipal, industrial, and agricultural users, are experiencing
6 or will experience within the foreseeable future substantial economic
7 hardships as a direct result of current or reasonably anticipated
8 activities which cause or contribute to contamination of ground water;
9 (c) Whether methods are available to stabilize or reduce the level
10 of contamination;
11 (d) Whether, if a management area has been established which
12 includes the affected area, the controls adopted by the district pursuant
13 to section 46-739 as administered and enforced by the district are
14 sufficient to address the ground water quality issues in the management
15 area; and
16 (e) Administrative factors directly affecting the ability to
17 implement and carry out regulatory activities.
18 (2) If the director Director of Environment and Energy determines
19 that no such area should be established, he or she shall issue an order
20 declaring that no management area shall be designated.
21 (3) If the director Director of Environment and Energy determines
22 that a management area shall be established, that the boundaries of an
23 existing management area shall be modified, or that the district shall be
24 required to adopt an action plan, he or she shall consult with relevant
25 state agencies and with the district or districts affected and determine
26 the boundaries of the area, taking into account the effect on political
27 subdivisions and the socioeconomic and administrative factors directly
28 affecting the ability to implement and carry out local ground water
29 management, control, and protection. The report by the director Director
30 of Environment and Energy shall include the specific reasons for the
31 creation of the management area or the requirement of such an action plan
-220-

2025 2025
1 and a full disclosure of the possible causes.
2 (4) When the boundaries of an area have been determined or modified,
3 the director Director of Environment and Energy shall issue an order
4 designating the area as a management area, specifying the modified
5 boundaries of the management area, or requiring such an action plan. Such
6 an order shall include a geographic and stratigraphic definition of the
7 area. Such order shall be published in the manner provided in section
8 46-744.
9 Sec. 184. Section 46-726, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 46-726 (1) Within one hundred eighty days after the designation of a
12 management area or the requiring of an action plan for a management area,
13 a purpose of which is protection of water quality, the district or
14 districts within whose boundaries the area is located shall prepare an
15 action plan designed to stabilize or reduce the level and prevent the
16 increase or spread of ground water contamination. Whenever a management
17 area or the affected area of such a management area encompasses portions
18 of two or more districts, the responsibilities and authorities delegated

13 by seasonal water level declines caused by other water wells in the same
14 area;
15 (m) It may close all or a portion of the management area to the
16 issuance of additional permits or may condition the issuance of
17 additional permits on compliance with other rules and regulations adopted
18 and promulgated by the district to achieve the purpose or purposes for
19 which the management area was designated; and
20 (n) It may adopt and promulgate such other reasonable rules and
21 regulations as are necessary to carry out the purpose for which a
22 management area was designated.
23 (2) In adopting, amending, or repealing any control authorized by
24 subsection (1) of this section or sections 46-740 and 46-741, the
25 district's considerations shall include, but not be limited to, whether
26 it reasonably appears that such action will mitigate or eliminate the
27 condition which led to designation of the management area or will improve
28 the administration of the area.
29 (3) Upon request by the district or when any of the controls being
30 proposed are for the purpose of integrated management of hydrologically
31 connected ground water and surface water, the director Director of
-227-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Natural Resources shall review and comment on the adoption, amendment, or
2 repeal of any authorized control in a management area. The director may
3 hold a public hearing to consider testimony regarding the control prior
4 to commenting on the adoption, amendment, or repeal of the control. The
5 director shall consult with the district and fix a time, place, and date
6 for such hearing. In reviewing and commenting on an authorized control in
7 a management area, the director's considerations shall include, but not
8 be limited to, those enumerated in subsection (2) of this section.
9 (4) If because of varying ground water uses, varying surface water
10 uses, different irrigation distribution systems, or varying climatic,
11 hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions existing within a management
12 area the uniform application throughout such area of one or more controls
13 would fail to carry out the intent of the Nebraska Ground Water
14 Management and Protection Act in a reasonably effective and equitable
15 manner, the controls adopted by the district pursuant to this section may
16 contain different provisions for different categories of ground water use
17 or portions of the management area which differ from each other because
18 of varying climatic, hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions. Any
19 differences in such provisions shall recognize and be directed toward
20 such varying ground water uses or varying conditions. Except as otherwise
21 provided in this section, if the district adopts different controls for
22 different categories of ground water use, those controls shall be
23 consistent with section 46-613 and shall, for each such category, be
24 uniform for all portions of the area which have substantially similar
25 climatic, hydrologic, geologic, and soil conditions.
26 (5) The district may establish different water allocations for
27 different irrigation distribution systems.
28 (6)(a) The district may establish different provisions for different
29 hydrologic relationships between ground water and surface water.
30 (b) For management areas a purpose of which is the integrated
31 management of hydrologically connected ground water and surface water,
-228-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 the district may establish different provisions for water wells either
2 permitted or constructed before the designation of a management area for
3 integrated management of hydrologically connected ground water and
4 surface water and for water wells either permitted or constructed on or
5 after the designation date or any other later date or dates established
6 by the district. Permits for construction of new wells not completed by
7 the date of the determination of fully appropriated shall be subject to
8 any conditions imposed by the applicable natural resources district.
9 (c) For a management area in a river basin or part of a river basin
10 that is or was the subject of litigation over an interstate water compact
11 or decree in which the State of Nebraska is a named defendant, the
12 district may establish different provisions for restriction of water
13 wells constructed after January 1, 2001, if such litigation was commenced
14 before or on May 22, 2001. If such litigation is commenced after May 22,
15 2001, the district may establish different provisions for restriction of
16 water wells constructed after the date on which such litigation is
17 commenced in federal court. An appeal from a decision of the district
18 under this subdivision shall be in accordance with the hearing procedures
19 established in the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act.
20 (d) Except as otherwise authorized by law, the district shall make a
21 replacement water well as defined in section 46-602, or as further
22 defined in district rules and regulations, subject to the same provisions
23 as the water well it replaces.
24 (7) If the district has included controls delineated in subdivision
25 (1)(m) of this section in its management plan, but has not implemented
26 such controls within two years after the initial public hearing on the
27 controls, the district shall hold a public hearing, as provided in
28 section 46-712, regarding the controls before implementing them.
29 (8) In addition to the controls listed in subsection (1) of this
30 section, a district in which a management area has been designated may
31 also adopt and implement one or more of the following measures if it
-229-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 determines that any such measures would help the district and water users
2 achieve the goals and objectives of the management area: (a) It may
3 sponsor nonmandatory educational programs; and (b) it may establish and
4 implement financial or other incentive programs. As a condition for
5 participation in an incentive program, the district may require water
6 users or landowners to enter into and perform such agreements or
7 covenants concerning the use of land or water as are necessary to produce
8 the benefits for which the incentive program is established and shall
9 further condition participation upon satisfaction of the requirements of
10 section 46-739.01.
11 Sec. 194. Section 46-740, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 46-740 (1) If allocation is adopted for use of ground water for
14 irrigation purposes in a management area, the permissible withdrawal of
15 ground water shall be allocated equally per irrigated acre except as
16 permitted by subsections (4) through (6) of section 46-739. Such
17 allocation shall specify the total number of acre-inches that are
18 allocated per irrigated acre per year, except that the district may allow
19 a ground water user to average his or her allocation over any reasonable
20 period of time. A ground water user may use his or her allocation on all
21 or any part of the irrigated acres to which the allocation applies or in
22 any other manner approved by the district.
23 (2) Except as permitted pursuant to subsections (4) through (6) of
24 section 46-739, if annual rotation or reduction of irrigated acres is
25 adopted for use of ground water for irrigation purposes in a management
26 area, the nonuse of irrigated acres shall be a uniform percentage
27 reduction of each landowner's irrigated acres within the management area
28 or a subarea of the management area. Such uniform reduction may be
29 adjusted for each landowner based upon crops grown on his or her land to
30 reflect the varying consumptive requirements between crops.
31 (3) Unless an integrated management plan, a rule, or an order is
-230-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 established, adopted, or issued prior to November 1, 2005, no integrated

11 of November 1, 2005, the minimum annual allocation may be the greater of
12 either the amount of ground water authorized by a permit issued pursuant
13 to the Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act or
14 the governmental, commercial, and industrial uses of the municipality
15 plus a per capita allowance. Water for commercial and industrial uses may
16 be limited as specified in subdivision (b)(iii) of this subsection.
17 (ii) The per capita allowance shall be based on the location of the
18 municipality, increasing in equal increments from east to west, and shall
19 not be less than two hundred gallons per person per day at 95 degrees, 19
20 minutes, 00 seconds longitude and not less than two hundred fifty gallons
21 per person per day at 104 degrees, 04 minutes, 00 seconds longitude.
22 Persons served by a municipality outside of its corporate limits shall be
23 considered part of the municipality's population if such service begins
24 prior to January 1, 2026.
25 (iii) Prior to January 1, 2026, any new or expanded single
26 commercial or single industrial development served by any municipality
27 within the fully appropriated or overappropriated area which, after July
28 14, 2006, commences water use resulting in the consumptive use of water
29 in amounts greater than twenty-five million gallons annually may be
30 subject to controls adopted pursuant to section 46-715;
31 (c) Prior to January 1, 2026, increases in the consumptive use of

16 conservation plan to qualify for such exemption.
17 (4) On and after January 1, 2026, the base amount for an annual
18 allocation to a municipality shall be determined as the greater of either
19 (a) the amount of water authorized by a permit issued pursuant to the
20 Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act or (b) the
21 greatest annual use prior to January 1, 2026, for uses specified in
22 subdivision (3)(b) of this section plus the per capita allowance
23 described in subdivision (3)(b)(ii) of this section. On and after January
24 1, 2026, increases in the consumptive use of water by a municipality that
25 result in a decrease in streamflow shall be addressed by the integrated
26 management plan pursuant to controls or incentive programs adopted
27 pursuant to section 46-715. Each municipality may be subject to controls
28 adopted pursuant to such section for amounts in excess of the

8 (i) the amount specified in a permit issued pursuant to the Industrial
9 Ground Water Regulatory Act or (ii) the amount necessary to achieve the
10 commercial or industrial use, including all new or expanded uses that
11 consume less than twenty-five million gallons annually. Any increases in
12 the consumptive use of water by a nonmunicipal commercial or industrial
13 water user that result in a decrease in streamflow shall be addressed by
14 the integrated management plan pursuant to controls or incentive programs
15 adopted pursuant to section 46-715;
16 (b) Prior to January 1, 2026, any new or expanded single commercial

13 for trespass or reasonable damages if reasonable care is exercised; and
14 (b) Obtain an inspection warrant in the manner prescribed in
15 sections 29-830 to 29-835 if any person refuses to allow the department
16 access or entry as authorized under this subdivision;
17 (6) Adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to enforce and
18 effectuate the general purpose and provisions of the Animal Health and
19 Disease Control Act, the Exotic Animal Auction or Exchange Venue Act, and
20 any other provisions the department deems necessary for carrying out its
21 duties under such acts including:
22 (a) Standards for program diseases to align with USDA/APHIS/VS
23 program standards;
24 (b) Provisions for maintaining a livestock disease reporting system;
25 (c) Procedures for establishing and maintaining accredited,
26 certified, validated, or designated disease-free animals, herds, or
27 flocks;

1 (e) In consultation with the Department of Water, Energy, and
2 Environment Environment and Energy and the University of Nebraska,
3 operating procedures governing composting of livestock carcasses;
4 (f) Recommendations of where and how any available federal funds and
5 state personnel and materials are to be allocated for the purpose of
6 program disease activities; and
7 (g) Provisions for secure food supply plans to ensure the continuity
8 of business is maintained during a foreign animal or transboundary
9 disease outbreak;
10 (7) When funds are available, develop a livestock emergency response
11 system capable of coordinating and executing a rapid response to the
12 incursion or potential incursion of a dangerous livestock disease episode
13 which poses a threat to the health of the state's livestock and could
14 cause a serious economic impact on the state, international trade, or

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 carrier shall have the burden to establish that the proposed route of the
2 major oil pipeline would serve the public interest. In determining
3 whether the pipeline carrier has met its burden, the commission shall not
4 evaluate safety considerations, including the risk or impact of spills or
5 leaks from the major oil pipeline, but the commission shall evaluate:
6 (a) Whether the pipeline carrier has demonstrated compliance with
7 all applicable state statutes, rules, and regulations and local
8 ordinances;
9 (b) Evidence of the impact due to intrusion upon natural resources
10 and not due to safety of the proposed route of the major oil pipeline to

25 (h) The views of the governing bodies of the counties and
26 municipalities in the area around the proposed route of the major oil
27 pipeline.
28 Sec. 238. Section 57-1502, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 57-1502 For purposes of sections 57-1501 to 57-1503:
31 (1) Department means the Department of Water, Energy, and
-267-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Environment Environment and Energy;
2 (2) Oil pipeline means a pipeline which is larger than eight inches
3 in inside diameter and which is constructed in Nebraska for the
4 transportation of petroleum, or petroleum components, products, or
5 wastes, including crude oil or any fraction of crude oil, within,
6 through, or across Nebraska, but does not include in-field and gathering
7 lines; and
8 (3) Pipeline carrier means an individual, a company, a corporation,
9 an association, or any other legal entity that engages in owning,
10 operating, or managing an oil pipeline.
11 Sec. 239. Section 57-1609, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 57-1609 Before issuing a permit, the commission shall consult with
14 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy
15 and the Underground Injection Control program permitting authority.
16 Sec. 240. Section 57-1614, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 57-1614 (1) The commission shall take action to ensure that a
19 storage facility does not cause pollution or create a nuisance. For the
20 purposes of this provision and in applying other laws, carbon dioxide
21 streams stored, and which remain in storage under a commission permit,
22 are not a pollutant and do not constitute a nuisance.
23 (2) The commission's authority in subsection (1) of this section
24 does not limit the jurisdiction held by the Department of Water, Energy,
25 and Environment Environment and Energy. Nothing else in the Nebraska
26 Geologic Storage of Carbon Dioxide Act limits the jurisdiction held by
27 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy.
28 (3) The commission shall take action to ensure that substances that
29 compromise the objectives of the act or the integrity of a storage
30 reservoir do not enter a storage reservoir.
31 (4) The commission shall take action to ensure that carbon dioxide
-268-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 does not escape from a storage facility.
2 Sec. 241. Section 57-1619, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 57-1619 (1) After carbon dioxide injections into a reservoir end and
5 upon application by the storage operator, the commission shall consider
6 issuing a certificate of project completion.
7 (2) The certificate may only be issued after public notice and
8 hearing. The commission shall establish notice requirements for such
9 hearing.
10 (3) The certificate may only be issued after the commission has
11 consulted with the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
12 Environment and Energy and the Underground Injection Control program
13 permitting authority.
14 (4) The certificate may only be issued if the storage operator:
15 (a) Is in full compliance with all laws governing the storage
16 facility;
17 (b) Shows that it has addressed all pending claims regarding the
18 storage facility's operation;
19 (c) Shows that it has received an authorization of site closure from
20 the applicable underground injection control program permitting authority
21 for each storage facility injection well; and
22 (d) Shows that any wells, equipment, and facilities to be used in
23 the post-closure period are in good condition and retain mechanical
24 integrity.
25 (5) Once a certificate is issued:
26 (a) Title to the storage facility and to the stored carbon dioxide
27 transfers, without payment of any compensation, to the State of Nebraska;
28 (b) Title acquired by the state includes all rights and interests
29 in, and all responsibilities associated with, the stored carbon dioxide;
30 (c) The storage operator and all persons who generated any injected
31 carbon dioxide streams are released from all regulatory requirements
-269-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 associated with the storage facility;
2 (d) Any financial assurance provided by the storage operator shall
3 be released; and
4 (e) Monitoring and managing the storage facility is the state's
5 responsibility to be overseen by the commission.
6 Sec. 242. Section 58-202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 58-202 (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
9 (a) The high cost of agricultural loans and the general
10 unavailability of such loans at favorable rates and terms for farmers,
11 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises have
12 resulted in decreased crop, livestock, and business productivity and
13 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
14 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
15 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
16 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
17 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
18 citizens of this state; and
19 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
20 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
21 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
22 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
23 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
24 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
25 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
26 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
27 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
28 construction industry;
29 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
30 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
31 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
-270-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
2 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
3 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
4 facilities; and
5 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
6 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
7 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
8 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
9 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
10 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
11 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
12 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
13 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
14 food and shelter;
15 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
16 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
17 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
18 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
19 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
20 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
21 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
22 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
23 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
24 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
25 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
26 facilities to produce and supply energy;
27 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
28 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
29 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
30 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
31 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
-271-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
2 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
3 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
4 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
5 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
6 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
7 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
8 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
9 suppliers.
10 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
11 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
12 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
13 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
14 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
15 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
16 and social liabilities to the entire state;
17 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
18 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
19 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
20 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
21 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
22 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
23 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
24 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
25 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
26 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
27 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
28 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
29 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
30 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
31 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
-272-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
2 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
3 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
4 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
5 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
6 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
7 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
8 and protect the public health and welfare;
9 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
10 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
11 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
12 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
13 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
14 needed within this state; and
15 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
16 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
17 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
18 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
19 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
20 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
21 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
22 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
23 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
24 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
25 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
26 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
27 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
28 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
29 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
30 safe drinking water facilities is great;
31 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
-273-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
2 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
3 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
4 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
5 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
6 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
7 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
8 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
9 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
10 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
11 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
12 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
13 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
14 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
15 and
16 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
17 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
18 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
19 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
20 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
21 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
22 section shall prohibit the provision of loans , including loans made
23 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act, to a municipality as
24 defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction, development,
25 rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of wastewater
26 treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.
27 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
28 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
29 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
30 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
31 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
-274-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
2 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
3 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
4 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
5 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
6 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
7 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
8 educational benefits and services;
9 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
10 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
11 and
12 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
13 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
14 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
15 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
16 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
17 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
18 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
19 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
20 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
21 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
22 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
23 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
24 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
25 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
26 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
27 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
28 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
29 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
30 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
31 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
-275-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
2 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
3 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
4 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
5 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
6 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
7 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
8 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
9 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
10 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
11 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
12 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
13 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
14 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
15 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
16 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
17 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
18 public health and welfare;
19 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
20 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
21 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
22 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
23 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
24 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
25 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
26 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the
27 financing of solid waste disposal areas and facilities and in the removal
28 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
29 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
30 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
31 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
-276-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
2 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save
3 lives, to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
4 (b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for
5 use by Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska
6 Public Safety Communication System Act;
7 (c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
8 required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies.
9 Since the maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the
10 cost of purchasing and operating multiple communication infrastructures
11 is prohibitive, it is imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in
12 their efforts to obtain real and personal property to establish, operate,
13 maintain, and manage public safety communication systems; and
14 (d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
15 political subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal
16 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition,
17 construction, and operation of real and personal property of public
18 safety communication systems.
19 (9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27,
20 2005, and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects,
21 there is a need to increase both the limit on individual net worth and
22 the limit on the aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the
23 authority. Such adjustments are necessary to address the inadequate
24 supply of and pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan
25 financing at interest rates and terms that are consistent with the needs
26 of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural
27 enterprises.
28 (10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
29 (a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy
30 the problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
31 insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
-277-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
2 funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal
3 sources;
4 (b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance
5 Authority Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies
6 and private entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such
7 public-private and intergovernmental cooperation; and
8 (c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made
9 available to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of
10 the economy to enable the authority to address the problems identified in
11 this section.
12 Sec. 243. Section 58-221, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
13 2024, is amended to read:
14 58-221 Residential energy conservation device shall mean any prudent
15 means of reducing the demands for conventional fuels or increasing the
16 supply or efficiency of these fuels in residential housing and shall
17 include, but not be limited to:
18 (1) Caulking and weather stripping of doors and windows;
19 (2) Furnace efficiency modifications, including:
20 (a) Replacement burners, furnaces, heat pumps, or boilers or any
21 combination thereof which, as determined by the Director of Water,
22 Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy, substantially increases
23 the energy efficiency of the heating system;
24 (b) Any device for modifying flue openings which will increase the
25 energy efficiency of the heating system; and
26 (c) Any electrical or mechanical furnace ignition system which
27 replaces a standing gas pilot light;
28 (3) A clock thermostat;
29 (4) Ceiling, attic, wall, and floor insulation;
30 (5) Water heater insulation;
31 (6) Storm windows and doors, multiglazed windows and doors, and
-278-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 heat-absorbed or heat-reflective glazed window and door materials;
2 (7) Any device which controls demand of appliances and aids load
3 management;
4 (8) Any device to utilize solar energy, biomass, geothermal, or wind
5 power for any residential energy conservation purpose including heating
6 of water and space heating or cooling; and
7 (9) Any other conservation device, renewable energy technology, and
8 specific home improvement necessary to insure the effectiveness of the
9 energy conservation measures as the Director of Water, Energy, and
10 Environment Environment and Energy by rule or regulation identifies.
11 Sec. 244. Section 60-6,363, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 60-6,363 For purposes of sections 60-6,363 to 60-6,374:
14 (1) Diesel-powered motor vehicle shall mean a self-propelled vehicle
15 which is designed primarily for transporting persons or property on a
16 highway and which is powered by an internal combustion engine of the
17 compression ignition type;
18 (2) Motor vehicle shall mean a self-propelled vehicle with a gross
19 unloaded vehicle weight of ten thousand pounds or more or any combination
20 of vehicles of a type subject to registration which is towed by such a
21 vehicle;
22 (3) Smoke shall mean the solid or liquid matter, except water,
23 discharged from a motor vehicle engine which obscures the transmission of
24 light;

4 facility during the twenty-four-month period immediately preceding
5 certification of the facility by the design engineer. No credits shall be
6 allowed under this subsection for expansion of an existing facility's
7 capacity until production is in excess of twelve times the three-month
8 average amount determined under this subsection during any twelve-
9 consecutive-month period beginning no sooner than June 1, 2000. New
10 production shall be approved by the Department of Revenue based on such
11 ethanol production records as may be necessary to reasonably determine
12 new production. This credit must be earned on or before December 31,
13 2003.
14 (2)(a) Beginning January 1, 2002, any new ethanol facility which is
15 in production at the minimum rate of one hundred thousand gallons
16 annually for the production of ethanol, before denaturing, and which has
17 provided to the Department of Revenue written evidence substantiating
18 that the ethanol facility has received the requisite authority from the

12 of the Department of Agriculture. Confirmation of approval by the
13 division shall be provided by the ethanol facility at the time the
14 initial claim for credits provided under this section is submitted to the
15 Department of Revenue and annually thereafter. Claims submitted by the
16 ethanol producer shall be based on the total number of gallons of ethanol
17 produced, before denaturing, during the reporting period measured in
18 gross gallons.
19 (5) The Department of Revenue shall prescribe an application form
20 and procedures for claiming credits under this section. In order for a
21 claim for credits to be accepted, it must be filed by the ethanol
22 producer within three years of the date the ethanol was produced or by
23 September 30, 2012, whichever occurs first.
24 (6) Every producer of ethanol shall maintain records similar to
25 those required by section 66-487. The ethanol producer must maintain
26 invoices, meter readings, load-out sheets or documents, inventory

2 information in a provable computer format or on microfilm is acceptable
3 in lieu of retention of the original documents. The records must be
4 retained for a period of not less than three years after the claim for
5 ethanol credits is filed.
6 (7) For purposes of ascertaining the correctness of any application
7 for claiming a credit provided in this section, the Tax Commissioner (a)
8 may examine or cause to have examined, by any agent or representative
9 designated by him or her for that purpose, any books, papers, records, or
10 memoranda bearing upon such matters, (b) may by summons require the
11 attendance of the person responsible for rendering the application or
12 other document or any officer or employee of such person or the
13 attendance of any other person having knowledge in the premises, and (c)
14 may take testimony and require proof material for his or her information,
15 with power to administer oaths or affirmations to such person or persons.
16 The time and place of examination pursuant to this subsection shall be
17 such time and place as may be fixed by the Tax Commissioner and as are
18 reasonable under the circumstances. In the case of a summons, the date
19 fixed for appearance before the Tax Commissioner shall not be less than
20 twenty days from the time of service of the summons. No taxpayer shall be
21 subjected to unreasonable or unnecessary examinations or investigations.
22 All records obtained pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the

19 department shall inform the owner or operator of its approval or
20 disapproval of a plan for remedial action within one hundred twenty days
21 after receipt of a remedial action plan which contains all required
22 information. If after one hundred twenty days the department fails to

24 proposed plan shall be deemed approved; and
25 (3) The approved remedial action plan shall then be carried out by
26 the owner or operator of the tank causing the release. All expenses
27 incurred during the remedial action shall be paid by the owner or
28 operator subject to reimbursement pursuant to the Petroleum Release
29 Remedial Action Act.
