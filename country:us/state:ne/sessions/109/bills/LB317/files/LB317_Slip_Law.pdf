renovated with money from the fund for the amount of the loan together with any
interest thereon. This lien shall attach to all project facilities, equipment,
easements, real property, and property of any kind or nature in which the loan
recipient has an interest and which is associated with the project. The
department shall file a statement of the lien, its amount, terms, and a
description of the project with the county register of deeds of each county in
which the project or any part thereof is located. The county register of deeds
shall record the lien and it shall be indexed as other liens are required by
law to be indexed. The lien shall be valid until paid in full or otherwise
discharged. The lien shall be foreclosed in accordance with applicable state
law governing foreclosure of mortgages and liens. Any lien provided for by this

state agency or of any natural resources district to regulate for ground water
quality or surface water quality as otherwise provided by law;
(2) To be responsible for the development and implementation of a state
management plan and pesticide management plans. The Department of Water,
Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy shall be responsible for the
adoption of standards for pesticides in surface water, ground water, and
drinking water. These standards shall be established as action levels in the
state management plan and pesticide management plans at which prevention and
mitigation measures are implemented. Such action levels may be set at or below
the maximum contaminant level set for any product as set by the federal agency
under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq., as the act
existed on January 1, 2021. The Department of Agriculture shall cooperate with

2025 2025
technical and other assistance as may be necessary or desirable in rural areas
to abate the lowering of water quality in the state caused by sedimentation,
effluent from feedlots, and runoff from cropland areas containing agricultural
chemicals. Such assistance shall be coordinated with the programs and the
stream quality standards as established by the department Department of
Environment and Energy.
Sec. 28. Section 2-3254, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
2-3254 (1) The board shall hold a hearing upon the question of the
desirability and necessity, in the interest of the public health, safety, and
welfare, of the establishment of or altering the boundaries of an existing
improvement project area and the undertaking of such a project, upon the
question of the appropriate boundaries describing affected land, upon the
propriety of the petition, and upon all relevant questions regarding such
inquiries. When a hearing has been initiated by petition, such hearing shall be
held within one hundred twenty days of the filing of such petition. Notice of
such hearing shall be published prior thereto once each week for three
consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper published or of general circulation in
the district. Landowners within the limits of the territory described in the
petition and all other interested parties, including any appropriate agencies
of state or federal government, shall have the right to be heard. If the board
finds, after consultation with such appropriate agencies of state and federal
government and after the hearing, that the project conforms with all applicable
law and with the district's goals, criteria, and policies, it shall enter its
findings in the board's official records and shall, with the aid of such
engineers, surveyors, and other assistants as it may have chosen, establish an
improvement project area or alter the boundaries of an existing improvement
project area, proceed to make detailed plans and cost estimates, determine the
total benefits, and carry out the project as provided in subsections (2) and
(3) of this section. If the board finds that the project does not so conform,
the findings shall be entered in the board's records and copies of such
findings shall be furnished to the petitioners and the commission.
(2) When any such special project would result in the provision of
revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall, prior to commencement
of construction of such project, determine, by circulation of petitions or by
some other appropriate method, if such project can be reasonably expected to
generate sufficient revenue to recover the reimbursable costs thereof. If it is
determined that the project cannot be reasonably expected to generate
sufficient revenue, the project and all work in connection therewith shall be
suspended. If it is determined that the project can be reasonably expected to
generate sufficient revenue, the board shall divide the total benefits of the
project as provided in sections 2-3252 to 2-3254. If the proposed project
involves the supply of water for any beneficial use, including a public water
system as defined in section 71-5301, all plans and specifications for the
project shall be filed with the secretary of the district and the Director of
Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources, except that if such project
involves a public water system as defined in section 71-5301, the filing of the
information shall be with the Department of Environment and Energy rather than
the Director of Natural Resources. No construction of any such special project
shall begin until the plans and specifications for such improvement have been
approved by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
Environment. When such a special project involves a public water system as
defined in section 71-5301, the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment
shall Director of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment and
Energy, if applicable, except that if such special project involves a public
water system as defined in section 71-5301, only the Department of Environment
and Energy shall be required to review such plans and specifications and
approve the same if in compliance with the Nebraska Safe Drinking Water Act and
departmental rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under the act. All
prescribed conditions having been complied with, each landowner within the
improvement project area shall, within any limits otherwise prescribed by law,
subscribe to a number of benefit units in proportion to the extent he or she
desires to participate in the benefits of the special project. As long as the
capacity of the district's facilities permit, participating landowners may
subscribe to additional units, within any limits otherwise prescribed by law,
upon payment of a unit fee for each such unit. The unit fees made and charged
pursuant to this section shall be levied and fixed by rules and regulations of
the district. The service provided may be withheld during the time such charges
levied upon such parcel of land are delinquent and unpaid. Such charges shall
be cumulative, and the service provided by the project may be withheld until
all delinquent charges for the operation and maintenance of such works of
improvement are paid for past years as well as for the current year. All such
charges, due and delinquent according to the rules and regulations of such
district and unpaid on June 1 after becoming due and delinquent, may be
certified by the governing authority of such district to the county clerk of
such county in which are situated the lands against which such charges have
been levied, and when so certified such charges shall be entered upon the tax
list and spread upon the tax roll the same as other special assessment taxes
are levied and assessed upon real estate, shall become a lien upon such real
estate along with other real estate taxes, and shall be collectible at the same
time, in the same manner, and in the same proceeding as other real estate taxes
are levied.
(3) When the special project would not result in the provision of revenue-
-14-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
producing continuing services, the board shall apportion the benefits thereof
accruing to the several tracts of land within the district which will be
benefited thereby, on a system of units. The land least benefited shall be
apportioned one unit of assessment, and each tract receiving a greater benefit
shall be apportioned a greater number of units or fraction thereof, according
to the benefits received. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the
district from establishing separate areas within the improvement project area
so as to permit future allocation of costs for particular portions of the work
to specific subareas. This subarea method of allocation shall not be used in
any improvement project area which has heretofore made a final apportionment of
units of benefits and shall not thereafter be changed except by compliance with
the procedure prescribed in this section.
(4) A notice shall be inserted for at least one week in a newspaper
published or of general circulation in the improvement project area stating the
time when and the place where the directors shall meet for the purpose of
hearing all parties interested in the apportionment of benefits by reason of
the improvement, at which time and place such parties may appear in person or
by counsel or may file written objections thereto. The directors shall then
proceed to hear and consider the same and shall make the apportionments fair
and just according to benefits received from the improvement. The directors,
having completed the apportionment of benefits, shall make a detailed report of
the same and file such report with the county clerk. The board of directors
shall include in such report a statement of the actual expenses incurred by the
district to that time which relate to the proposed project and the actual cost
per benefit unit thereof. Thereupon the board of directors shall cause to be
published, once each week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper published
or of general circulation in the improvement project area, a notice that the
report required in this subsection has been filed and notice shall also be sent
to each party appearing to have a direct legal interest in such apportionment,
which notice shall include the description of the lands in which each party
notified appears to have such interest, the units of benefit assigned to such
lands, the amount of actual costs assessable to date to such lands, and the
estimated total costs of the project assessable to such lands upon completion
thereof, as provided by sections 25-520.01 to 25-520.03. If the owners of
record title representing more than fifty percent of the estimated total
assessments file with the board within thirty days of the final publication of
such notice written objections to the project proposed, such project and work
in connection therewith shall be suspended, such project shall not be done in
such project area, and all expenses relating to such project incurred by and
accrued to the district may, at the direction of the board of directors, be
assessed upon the lands which were to have been benefited by the completion of
such improvement project in accordance with the apportionment of benefits
determined and procedures established in this section. Upon completing the
establishment of an improvement project area or altering the boundaries of an
existing improvement project area as provided in this subsection and upon
determining the reimbursable cost of the project and the period of time over
which such cost shall be assessed, the board of directors shall determine the
amount of money necessary to raise each year by special assessment within such
improvement project area and apportion the same in dollars and cents to each
tract benefited according to the apportionment of benefits as determined by
this section. The board of directors shall also, from time to time as it deems
necessary, order an additional assessment upon the lands and property benefited
by the project, using the original apportionment of benefits as a basis to
ascertain the assessment to each tract of land benefited, to carry out a
reasonable program of operation and maintenance upon the construction or
capital improvements involved in such project. The chairperson and secretary
shall thereupon return lists of such tracts with the amounts chargeable to each
of the county clerks of each county in which assessed lands are located, who
shall place the same on duplicate tax lists against the lands and lots so
assessed. Such assessments shall be collected and accounted for by the county
treasurer at the same time as general real estate taxes, and such assessments
shall be and remain a perpetual lien against such real estate until paid. All
provisions of law for the sale, redemption, and foreclosure in ordinary tax
matters shall apply to such special assessments.
Sec. 29. Section 2-3279, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
2-3279 All plans submitted by a district under section sections 2-3276 to
2-3278, except those filed in compliance with state requirements or for the
purpose of state financial assistance, shall be accorded a thirty-day period
for review and comment. Failure to reply within thirty days shall be conclusive
that the plans have been endorsed by the reviewing agency. All comments on
plans shall be reviewed by the district and alterations of the plans may be
made as the district deems appropriate. If any state agency comments indicate a
lack of conformance with the goals, criteria, and policies of any outdoor
recreation plan, any fish and wildlife plan, or indicate a conflict with state
policies or plans approved by the Legislature, such plans shall be altered as
deemed necessary by the district prior to proceeding with implementation.
Sec. 30. Section 2-3280, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
2-3280 No state funds shall be allocated or disbursed to a district unless
that district has submitted its master plan in accordance with sections 2-3229
and 2-3276 to 2-3280 and until the disbursing agency has determined that such
funds are for plans, facilities, works, and programs which are in conformance
-15-

2025 2025
with the plans of the agency.
Sec. 31. Section 2-4602, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
2-4602 The Legislature recognizes that erosion and sedimentation are
serious problems throughout the state. Changes in farm and ranch enterprises,
operations, and ownership, demands made upon farm and ranch enterprises which
do not encourage sound resource utilization, rapid shifts in land use from
agricultural and rural to nonagricultural and urban uses, construction of
streets, highways, pipelines, recreation areas, schools and universities,
public utilities and facilities, conversion of grasslands to croplands, and
other land-disturbing activities have caused excessive wind erosion and water
runoff and accelerated the process of soil erosion and sediment deposition.
This has resulted in the pollution of the waters of the state and damage to
domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other
resources. It is declared to be the policy of the state to strengthen and
extend the present erosion and sediment control activities and programs of the
state for both rural and urban lands, to improve water quality, and to
establish and implement, through the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment
Natural Resources and the Nebraska Natural Resources Commission, a statewide,
comprehensive, and coordinated erosion and sediment control program to reduce
damage from wind erosion and storm water runoff, to retard nonpoint pollution
from sediment and related pollutants, and to conserve and protect land, air,
and other resources of the state. This program shall be carried out by the
natural resources districts in cooperation with the counties, municipalities,
and other local governments and political subdivisions of the state and other
public and private entities.

technical, planning, or financial assistance in the establishment of the soil
and water conservation practices necessary to implement the plan or a portion
of the plan;
(3) Director means the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural
Resources;
(4) District means a natural resources district;
(5) Erosion or sediment control practice means:

sewer system, any water which would otherwise cause erosion in excess of the
applicable soil-loss tolerance level and which does not carry or constitute
sewage or industrial or other waste;
(b) The employment of temporary devices or structures, temporary seeding,
fiber mats, plastic, straw, diversions, silt fences, sediment traps, or other
measures adequate either to prevent erosion in excess of the applicable soil-
loss tolerance level or to prevent excessive downstream sedimentation from land
which is the site of or is directly affected by any nonagricultural land-
disturbing activity; or
(c) The establishment and maintenance of vegetation upon the right-of-way
of any completed portion of any public street, road, or highway or the
construction or installation thereon of permanent structures or devices or
other measures adequate to prevent erosion of the right-of-way in excess of the
applicable soil-loss tolerance level;
(6) Excess erosion means the occurrence of erosion in excess of the
applicable soil-loss tolerance level which causes or contributes to an
accumulation of sediment upon the lands of any other person to the detriment or
damage of such other person;
(7) Farm unit conservation plan means a plan jointly developed by the
owner and, if appropriate, the operator of a farm unit and the district within
which the farm unit is located based upon the determined conservation needs for
the farm unit and identifying the soil and water conservation practices which

of the applicable soil-loss tolerance level. The plan may also, if practicable,
identify alternative practices by which such objective may be attained;
(8) Nonagricultural land-disturbing activity means a land change,
including, but not limited to, tilling, clearing, grading, excavating,
transporting, or filling land, which may result in soil erosion from wind or
water and the movement of sediment and sediment-related pollutants into the
waters of the state or onto lands in the state but does not include the

constructed to add thereto further construction in the nature of a settling
basin into which waters will be permitted to flow for the purpose of dropping
silt before finding their outlet into any part of the main or lateral ditches
of such drainage district improvement, such drainage district, if not able to
agree with the landowner on the yearly cash rental of any premises taken and
used for such purpose, shall have the right to condemn for the purpose of
fixing the yearly rental for the land so taken. If such drainage district takes

the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources shall
investigate the conditions of such watercourse, and if the department
determines that further improvement in such watercourse downstream is for the
interest of lands adjacent to such watercourse below the point of the
improvement, the department shall file a plan of such improvement in the office
of the county clerk of each of the counties in which any of the lands to be
benefited are situated and in which any portion of the watercourse to be
improved is located. Such plan shall describe the boundaries of the district to
be benefited and shall contain an estimate of the benefits that would accrue to
the sanitary district by reason of such improvement as well as the cost thereof
and an estimate of the special benefits that would accrue to lands adjacent to
the watercourse by reason of improved drainage, such estimate being detailed as

district, which notice shall state the filing of the report and estimate, the
boundaries of the district to be benefited, that an election will be held at
the office of the county clerk between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on a day
named in the notice, and that at the election the question of the formation of
a sanitary drainage district to include the area described in the report will
be determined. The election shall be held in accordance with sections 31-406 to

creation of a district based on acreage represented, the sanitary drainage
district shall have jurisdiction to make the improvements recommended by the
Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources and to levy a
special assessment on the lands specially benefited. If a majority vote against
the creation of a district, the work shall not be done.
Sec. 53. Section 31-515, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
31-515 The proceedings for imposing of special assessment by the board of
trustees shall be, as nearly as may be, according to those for special
assessments by the mayor and council under the law governing cities of the
first class. If improvements are recommended by the Department of Water,
Energy, and Environment Natural Resources and a sanitary drainage district is
formed adjacent to a watercourse previously improved above such district
pursuant to sections 31-508 and 31-509, the board of trustees shall advertise
for bids for the construction of such improvements as are recommended by the
department and in accordance with plans recommended by the department.

the cost of such improvement as the report of the Department of Water, Energy,
and Environment Natural Resources finds to represent the special benefits of
the land the drainage of which such improvements would improve. At such hearing
such board of equalization shall hear all complaints with reference to the
assessments proposed under the findings of the department. The trustees sitting
as a board of equalization shall have power to increase or decrease such
special assessments to the end that the property shall be assessed its
equitable portion of the cost of such improvement, but not exceeding in the
aggregate the percentage of the total cost recommended by the department to be
assessed against such property and not exceeding in any case the actual special
benefits accruing to such land. Notice of such meeting of the board of
equalization shall be given by publishing a notice thereof in a paper,
published in the county seat in each of the counties where any of the lands to
be assessed are situated, once each week for three consecutive weeks. Appeals
from the findings of such board of equalization may be taken in the manner
provided for appeals from assessments of drainage districts organized under
sections 31-401 to 31-450.

Department of Natural Resources pursuant to section 46-294 or sections 46-2,122
to 46-2,126.
(2) The board of directors may by the adoption of appropriate bylaws
provide for the suspension of water delivery to any land in such district upon
which the irrigation taxes levied and assessed thereon shall remain due and
unpaid for two years. It shall be the duty of the directors to make all
necessary arrangements for right-of-way for laterals from the main canal to
each tract of land subject to assessment, and when necessary the board shall
exercise its right of eminent domain to procure right-of-way for the laterals

be just and equitable.
(3) In times of reduced water supply, when the volume of water is not
adequate to be beneficially used when equitably apportioned to all landowners
in the district, the board may, after providing notice to landowners in a
portion of the district and upon receiving no objections from the majority of
such landowners, elect not to deliver water to that portion of the district.
Such election shall not subject the district to liability under section 46-160
and shall not affect the rights of landowners in that portion of the district
to water deliveries in the future. Any election to not deliver water to a
portion of the district shall be made on a year-to-year basis, not to exceed
ten years, and such election shall not subject any landowner to adjudication of
his or her water right under section 46-229. The board may adjust the tolls or
charges made to landowners within the district to reflect the decrease in

2025 2025
redemption, if possible, of all outstanding bonded and other indebtedness of
the district, but shall in no case pay more than the market value of such
outstanding bonds with interest up to the time of payment. In cases when bonds
not yet due cannot be redeemed by reason of the refusal of the owner thereof to
surrender them before due, the board may invest the surplus money of the
district, after paying all debts that can be paid, in state, county, or other
safe bonds, bearing the same or greater rate of interest, if possible, than the
district bonds thus outstanding, for the purpose of paying such outstanding
bonds of the district when due. In case the amount realized from the sale of
such district property, together with other money of the district, is
insufficient for the payment of all the indebtedness of the district,
assessments shall continue to be made against the lands included in the
district in the manner provided by law for assessments to pay bonds and other
indebtedness of irrigation districts until a sufficient amount is raised to
fully pay all obligations of such district.
Any balance of funds remaining after the sale or disposition of all
property belonging to the district and after all obligations and indebtedness
of the district have been paid or discharged shall be distributed by the county
treasurer to all assessment payers of the district of record as of the date of
the filing with in the Chief Water Officer office of the Department of Water,
Energy, and Environment Natural Resources of the report referred to in section

all of the obligations of such district have been paid, the directors of such
district shall file in the office of the county clerk of each county in which
such district is located, and with in the Chief Water Officer office of the
Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources, a report
attested by the secretary of the board, stating that the district has disposed
of its property and franchises, except for any balance of funds remaining, and
has discontinued operation, which report shall be recorded in the miscellaneous
record of such counties. Each easement and right-of-way, whether owned by the
district in fee or otherwise, shall automatically be terminated and
extinguished and such interest together with any canal or other structure shall
become the property of the owner of the land upon which such easement, right-
of-way, canal, or other structure is located or, if owned in fee by the
district, shall become the property of the owner of the land adjacent thereto,
upon the filing of the report with the Chief Water Officer department. If any
person has any claim against such district which is not settled or disposed of
at the time of the filing of such report and such person fails or neglects to
bring suit upon such claim within one year after the time of the filing of such
report, such claim or claims shall be forever barred as against such district
as well as against all persons and property therein.
Sec. 65. Section 46-193, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended

the board of directors shall, by a resolution entered on its record, formulate
a general plan of its proposed operation in which it shall state (1) what
constructed works or other property it proposes to purchase and the cost of
purchasing the same and (2) what construction work it proposes to do and how it
proposes to raise the funds for carrying out such plan. For the purpose of
ascertaining the cost of any such construction work, the board shall cause such
surveys, examinations, and plans to be made as will demonstrate the
practicability of such plan and furnish the proper basis for an estimate of the
costs of carrying out the same. All such surveys, examinations, maps, plans,
and estimates shall be made under the direction of a competent irrigation
engineer and certified by the engineer. The board shall then submit a copy of
the same to the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
Environment Director of Natural Resources within ninety days thereafter, who
shall file a report upon the same with the board, which report shall contain
such matters as in the judgment of the Chief Water Officer director may be
desirable.

with subsection (1) of this section. A copy of the order canceling the
appropriation, or part thereof, shall be posted on the department's website and
shall be provided to the owner or owners of the appropriation and to any other
owner of the land under the appropriation in the same manner that notices are
to be given in accordance with subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section

rights provided by subsections (5) and (6) of section 46-229.04.
(3) If an owner of the appropriation provides notification to the Chief
Water Officer department in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the
Chief Water Officer department shall review the owner's stated reasons for
contesting the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary determination and
any other information provided with the owner's notice. If the Chief Water
Officer department determines that the owner has provided sufficient

(5) If the Chief Water Officer department determines that subsections (2),
(3), and (4) of this section do not apply, the Chief Water Officer it shall
schedule and conduct a hearing on the cancellation of the appropriation in
whole or in part. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to the owner or
owners who filed notices with the Chief Water Officer department pursuant to

Officer department and cannot reasonably be obtained by the Chief Water Officer
department, such notice shall be served by publication in a legal newspaper
published or of general circulation in any county in which the place of
diversion is located and in a legal newspaper published or of general

be once each week for three consecutive weeks.
(4) Landowners whose property under such appropriation is located within
the corporate limits of a city or village shall be served by the publication of
such notice in a legal newspaper published or of general circulation in the
county in which the city or village is located. The notice shall be published

Sec. 80. Section 46-229.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-229.04 (1) At a hearing held pursuant to section 46-229.03, the
verified field investigation report of an employee of the department, or such
other report or information that is relied upon by the Chief Water Officer
department to reach the preliminary determination of nonuse, shall be prima
facie evidence for the forfeiture and annulment of such water appropriation. If
no person appears at the hearing, such water appropriation or unused part
thereof shall be declared forfeited and annulled. If an interested person
appears and contests the same, the Chief Water Officer department shall hear
evidence, and if it appears that such water has not been put to a beneficial
use or has ceased to be used for such purpose for more than five consecutive
years, the same shall be declared canceled and annulled unless the Chief Water
Officer department finds that (a) there has been sufficient cause for such
nonuse as provided for in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of this section or (b)
subsection (5) or (6) of this section applies.
(2) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to thirty
consecutive years if:
(a) Such nonuse was caused by the unavailability of water for that use.
For a river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been designated as
overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined by the Chief Water
Officer department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714, the
period of time within which sufficient cause for nonuse because of the
unavailability of water may be deemed to exist may be extended beyond thirty
years by the Chief Water Officer department upon petition therefor by the owner
of the appropriation if the Chief Water Officer department determines that an
integrated management plan being implemented in the river basin, subbasin, or
reach involved is likely to result in restoration of a usable water supply for
the appropriation; or
(b) The land subject to the appropriation is under an acreage reserve
program or production quota or is otherwise withdrawn from use as required for
participation in any federal, state, or natural resources district program, or
such land was previously under such a program but currently is not under such a
program and there have been not more than five consecutive years of nonuse on
such land subsequent to when that land was last under such program.
(3) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist indefinitely if
such nonuse was the result of one or more of the following:
(a) For any tract of land under separate ownership, the available supply
was used but on only part of the land under the appropriation because of an
inadequate water supply;
(b) The appropriation is a storage appropriation and there was an
inadequate water supply to provide the water for the storage appropriation or
less than the full amount of the storage appropriation was needed to keep the
reservoir full; or
(c) The appropriation is a storage-use appropriation and there was an
inadequate water supply to provide the water for the appropriation or use of
the storage water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions.
(4) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to fifteen
consecutive years if such nonuse was a result of one or more of the following:
(a) Federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations temporarily
prevented or restricted such use;
(b) Use of the water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions;
(c) Circumstances were such that a prudent person, following the
-32-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
principles of good husbandry, would not have been expected to use the water;
(d) The works, diversions, or other facilities essential to use the water
were destroyed by a cause not within the control of the owner of the
appropriation and good faith efforts to repair or replace the works,
diversions, or facilities have been and are being made;
(e) The owner of the appropriation was in active involuntary service in
the armed forces of the United States or was in active voluntary service during
a time of crisis; or
(f) Legal proceedings prevented or restricted use of the water.
The Chief Water Officer department may specify by rule and regulation
other circumstances that shall be deemed to constitute sufficient cause for
nonuse for up to fifteen years.
(5) When an appropriation is held in the name of an irrigation district, a
reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district, a mutual
irrigation company or canal company, or the United States Bureau of Reclamation
and the Chief Water Officer director determines that water under that
appropriation has not been used on a specific parcel of land for more than five
years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse exists, the right to use
water under that appropriation on that parcel shall be terminated and notice of
the termination shall be posted on the department's website and shall be given
in the manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The
district or company holding such right shall have five years after the
determination, or five years after an order of cancellation issued by the Chief
Water Officer department following the filing of a voluntary relinquishment of
the water appropriation that has been signed by the landowner and the
appropriator of record, to assign the right to use that portion of the
appropriation to other land within the district or the area served by the
company, to file an application for a transfer in accordance with section
46-290, or to transfer the right in accordance with sections 46-2,127 to
46-2,129. The Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its order of
cancellation within sixty days after receipt of the voluntary relinquishment
unless the relinquishment is conditioned by the landowner upon an action of a
governmental agency. If the relinquishment contains such a provision, the Chief
Water Officer department shall issue the its order of cancellation within sixty
days after receipt of notification that such action has been completed. The
Chief Water Officer department shall be notified of any such assignment within
thirty days after such assignment. If the district or company does not assign
the right to use that portion of the appropriation to other land, does not file
an application for a transfer within the five-year period, or does not notify
the Chief Water Officer department within thirty days after any such
assignment, that portion of the appropriation shall be canceled without further
proceedings by the Chief Water Officer department and the district or company
involved shall be so notified by the Chief Water Officer department. During the
time within which assignment of a portion of an appropriation is pending, the
allowable diversion rate for the appropriation involved shall be reduced, as
necessary, to avoid inconsistency with the rate allowed by section 46-231 or
with any greater rate previously approved for such appropriation by the Chief
Water Officer director in accordance with section 46-229.06.
(6) When it is determined by the Chief Water Officer director that an
appropriation, for which the location of use has been temporarily transferred
in accordance with sections 46-290 to 46-294, has not been used at the new
location for more than five years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse
exists, the right to use that appropriation at the temporary location of use
shall be terminated. Notice of that termination shall be posted on the
department's website and shall be given in the manner provided in subsection
(2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The right to reinitiate use of that
appropriation at the location of use prior to the temporary transfer shall
continue to exist for five years after the Chief Water Officer's director's
determination, but if such use is not reinitiated at that location within such
five-year period, the appropriation shall be subject to cancellation in
accordance with sections 46-229 to 46-229.04.
(7) If at the time of a hearing conducted in accordance with subsection
(1) of this section there is an application for incidental or intentional
underground water storage pending before the Chief Water Officer department and
filed by the owner of the appropriation, the proceedings shall be consolidated.
Sec. 81. Section 46-229.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-229.05 An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Chief Water
Officer department upon such hearing as provided by section 61-207.
Sec. 82. Section 46-229.06, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-229.06 When a departmental proceeding that is conducted pursuant to
sections 46-229 to 46-229.04 concerns the partial cancellation of an
appropriation, the Chief Water Officer department may receive evidence on the
question of whether, following such partial cancellation, a reduction in the
rate of diversion to the maximum rate prescribed in section 46-231 would result
in an authorized diversion rate less than the rate necessary, in the interests
of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands that remain subject
to the appropriation. If the Chief Water Officer director determines, based on
a preponderance of the evidence, that such rate would be less than the rate
necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops, he
or she may approve a diversion rate for the remaining portion of the
appropriation greater than the maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such
-33-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
increased rate can be no greater than the rate authorized for the appropriation
prior to the partial cancellation and no greater than the rate determined by
the Chief Water Officer director to be necessary, in the interests of good
husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands that remain subject to the
appropriation.
Sec. 83. Section 46-230, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-230 (1) As the adjudication of a stream progresses and as each claim is
finally adjudicated, the Chief Water Officer director shall make and cause to
be entered of record in his or her office an order determining and establishing
the priorities of right to use the water of such stream, the amount of the
appropriation of the persons claiming water from such stream and the character
of use for which each appropriation is found to have been made, and the address
of the owner of each water appropriation.
(2) Whenever requested by the Chief Water Officer department, the owner of
any appropriation not held by an irrigation district, reclamation district,
public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company
shall provide the Chief Water Officer department with the name, address, and
telephone number of each then-current owner of the appropriation and with the
name, address, and telephone number of any tenant or other person who is
authorized by the owner to receive opening and closing notices and other
departmental communications relating to the appropriation. Each appropriation
owner shall also notify the Chief Water Officer department any time there is a
change in any of such names, addresses, or telephone numbers. Notice of
ownership changes may be provided to the Chief Water Officer department in the
manner provided in section 76-2,124 or in any other manner authorized by the
Chief Water Officer department. If notice of an ownership change is provided
other than in accordance with such section, the notice shall include such
evidence of ownership as the Chief Water Officer director may require. Notice
of all other changes may be provided in any manner authorized by the Chief
Water Officer department. Upon receipt of any new information, the Chief Water
Officer department shall update the Chief Water Officer's its records. The
Chief Water Officer department shall not collect a fee for the filing of any
such information or for updating the Chief Water Officer's its records.
Sec. 84. Section 46-231, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-231 Each appropriation shall be determined in its priority and amount
by the time at which it is made and the amount of water which the works are
constructed to carry. An appropriator shall at no time be entitled to the use
of more than he or she can beneficially use for the purposes for which the
appropriation has been made, and the amount of any appropriation made by means
of enlargement of the distributing works shall be determined in like manner.
An allotment from the natural flow of streams for irrigation shall not
exceed one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of land and
shall not exceed three acre-feet in the aggregate during one calendar year for
each acre of land for which such appropriation has been made, and an allotment
shall not exceed the least amount of water that experience may indicate is
necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of crops. Such
limitations do not apply to storage waters or to water appropriations
transferred pursuant to sections 46-2,122 to 46-2,125 and 46-2,127 to 46-2,129.
When storage water is being used in addition to the natural flow, the
person in charge of the ditch or canal shall, upon his or her request and
within twenty-four hours thereof, be notified in writing by the user of such
storage waters of the time of withdrawal from natural streams to be distributed
according to law.
When an appropriation is for irrigation purposes and the amount is so
small that a proper distribution and application is impractical, as much water
as the applicant can use without waste may be allotted for a limited time so
fixed by the Chief Water Officer department as to give each appropriator his or
her just share without violating other rights, so long as (1) the volume of
water used in a twenty-four-hour period does not exceed the amount of water
that would otherwise have been allowed at the approved fixed continuous rate
for a twenty-four-hour period or (2) the volume of water used in a seven-day,
Monday-through-Sunday period does not exceed the amount of water that would
otherwise have been allowed at the approved fixed continuous rate for a seven-
day period. The Chief Water Officer department shall determine schedules among
appropriators to assure that other rights are not violated.
Sec. 85. Section 46-233, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-233 (1) The United States and every person intending to appropriate any
of the public waters of the State of Nebraska shall, before (a) commencing the
construction, enlargement, or extension of any works for such purpose, (b)
performing any work in connection with such construction, enlargement, or
extension, or (c) taking any water from any constructed works, make an
application to the Chief Water Officer department for a permit to make such
appropriation. A permit may be obtained to appropriate public waters for
intentional underground water storage and recovery of such water. A public
water supplier may make application to appropriate public waters for induced
ground water recharge.
(2) The application shall be upon a form prescribed and furnished by the
Chief Water Officer department without cost to an applicant. Such application
shall set forth (a) the name and post office address of the applicant, (b) the
source from which such appropriation shall be made, (c) the amount of the
-34-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
appropriation desired, as nearly as it may be estimated, (d) the location of
any proposed work in connection with the appropriation, (e) the estimated time
required for its completion, which estimated time shall include the period
required for the construction of ditches, pumps, and other features or devices,
(f) the time estimated at which the application of the water for the beneficial
purposes shall be made, which time shall be limited to a reasonable time
following the estimated time of completion of the work when prosecuted with
diligence, (g) the purpose for which water is to be applied and (i) if for
induced ground water recharge by a public water supplier, a statement of the
times of the year when and location along a stream where flows for induced
ground water recharge are proposed and (ii) if for irrigation, a description of
the land to be irrigated by the water and the amount, and (h) such facts and
supporting documentation as are required by the Chief Water Officer department
which shall include, but not be limited to, the depth of all wells, the extent
of the underlying aquifer, the expected rate of recharge, the minimum flow or
flows necessary to sustain the well field throughout the reach identified, and
the period of time that a well field would continue to meet minimal essential
needs of the public water supplier when there is no flow as those factors
relate to and are part of an evaluation of pertinent hydrologic relationships.
A public water supplier making application for induced ground water
recharge may submit with its application a statement of the amount of induced
ground water recharge water which the public water supplier presently uses as
well as the amount of induced ground water recharge water it anticipates using
in the next twenty-five-year period. Such statement shall also quantify the
total amount of water the public water supplier presently uses from the well
field as well as the total amount of water it anticipates using from the well
field in the next twenty-five-year period.
(3) Upon receipt of an application containing the information set forth in
this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall (a) make a record of the
receipt of the application, (b) cause the application to be recorded in its
office, and (c) make a careful examination of the application to ascertain
whether it sets forth all the facts necessary to enable the Chief Water Officer
department to determine the nature and amount of the proposed appropriation. If
such an examination shows the application in any way defective, it shall be
returned to the applicant for correction, with a statement of the correction
required, within ninety days after its receipt. Ninety days shall be allowed
for the refiling of the application, and in default of such refiling, the
application shall stand dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this
section, if so filed and corrected as required within such time, the
application shall, upon being accepted and allowed, take priority as of the
date of the original filing, subject to compliance with the future provisions
of the law and the rules and regulations thereunder. During the pendency of any
application or upon its approval, the Chief Water Officer department, upon
proper authorization and request of the applicant, may assign the application a
later priority date.
(4) For public water supplier wells in existence on September 9, 1993, the
priority date assigned to an application for induced ground water recharge made
by a public water supplier shall be:
(a) June 27, 1963, for water supply wells and facilities constructed and
placed in service on or before June 27, 1963;
(b) January 1, 1970, for water supply wells and facilities constructed and
placed in service on or after June 28, 1963, and on or before December 31,
1969;
(c) January 1, 1980, for water supply wells and facilities constructed and
placed in service on or after January 1, 1970, and on or before December 31,
1979;
(d) January 1, 1990, for water supply wells and facilities constructed and
placed in service on or after January 1, 1980, and on or before December 31,
1989; and
(e) January 1, 1993, for water supply wells and facilities constructed and
placed in service on or after January 1, 1990, and on or before September 9,
1993.
(5) Prior to taking action on an application for induced ground water
recharge, the Chief Water Officer director shall publish notice of such
application at the applicant's expense at least once each week for three
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the
stream segment and also in a newspaper of statewide circulation. The notice
shall state that any person having an interest may, in writing, object to the
application. Any such objection shall be filed with the Chief Water Officer
department within two weeks after the final publication of the notice.
(6) After the Chief Water Officer director has accepted the application
made under subsection (2) of this section as a completed application and
published notice as required under subsection (5) of this section, the Chief
Water Officer director shall, if he or she determines that a hearing is
necessary, set a time and place for a public hearing on the application. The
hearing shall be held within reasonable proximity to the area in which the
wells are or would be located. At the hearing the applicant shall present all
hydrological data and other evidence supporting its application. All interested
parties shall be allowed to testify and present evidence relative to the
application.
(7) An unapproved application pending on August 26, 1983, may be amended
to include appropriation for intentional underground water storage and recovery
of such water.

(8) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer department for a
temporary permit to appropriate water. The same standards for granting a
permanent appropriation shall apply for granting such temporary permit except
when the temporary permit is for road construction or other public use
construction and the amount of water requested is less than ten acre-feet in
total volume. For temporary permits for public-use construction, the applicant
shall include on the application the location of the diversion, the location of
use, a description of the project, the amount of water requested, and the
person to contact. Temporary permits for public-use construction and for less
than ten acre-feet in total volume may be granted without any determination of
unappropriated water and shall be considered to be in the public interest. The
requirement of filing a map or plans with the application for a temporary
permit may be waived at the discretion of the Chief Water Officer director. In
granting a temporary permit, the Chief Water Officer director shall specify a
date on which the right to appropriate water under the permit shall expire.
Under no circumstances shall such date be longer than one calendar year after
the date the temporary permit was granted. Temporary permits shall be
administered during times of shortage based on priority. The right to
appropriate water shall automatically terminate on the date specified by the
Chief Water Officer director on the temporary permit without further action by
the Chief Water Officer department.
(9) Water may be diverted from any stream, reservoir, or canal by any fire
department or emergency response services for the purpose of extinguishing a
fire in progress in an emergency without obtaining a permit from the Chief
Water Officer department. The installation of a dry well for this purpose is
allowed without the prior permission of the Chief Water Officer department, but
the Chief Water Officer department shall be informed of any such installation,
its location, and the party responsible for its installation and maintenance
within thirty days after the installation.
Sec. 86. Section 46-233.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-233.01 (1) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer
department for a permit to appropriate any of the public surface waters of the
State of Nebraska to be diverted or stored in Nebraska for use in any other
state.
(2) In determining whether to grant such application, the Chief Water
Officer director shall consider the following factors:
(a) Whether unappropriated water exists in the source of supply named in
the application;
(b) Whether such application and appropriation when perfected are not
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
(c) Whether denial of the application is demanded by the public interest;
and
(d) Whether the proposed use is a beneficial use of water.
(3) When determining whether denial of such application is demanded by the
public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall consider the following
factors:
(a) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed use;
(b) Any adverse economic, environmental, and other impacts of the proposed
use;
(c) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated water;
(d) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of not allowing the
appropriation and preserving the water supply for beneficial uses within the
state;
(e) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant; and
(f) Any other factors consistent with the purposes of this section that
the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant to protecting the interests of
the state and its citizens.
The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the overall
benefits to Nebraska are greater than the adverse impacts to Nebraska. The
Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying an application shall
specify the reasons for such action, including a discussion of the required
factors for consideration, and shall document such decision by reference to the
hearing record, if any, and to any other sources used by the Chief Water
Officer director in making the decision.
Sec. 87. Section 46-234, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-234 If there is no unappropriated water in the source of supply or if a
prior appropriation has been perfected to water the same land to be watered by
the applicant, the Chief Water Officer department may refuse such application.
An application may also be refused (1) if existing facilities other than those
owned or operated by the applicant are to be utilized and the applicant fails
to show, by documentary evidence, agreements with the owner and operator of the
facilities to allow the applicant to use such facilities or (2) when denial is
demanded by the public interest. The party making such application shall not
prosecute such work so long as such refusal continues in force. An application
for appropriation shall not be exclusive of any of the lands included therein
until the owner or owners of such land give consent to the same in proper form
duly acknowledged. No application made or canal constructed, prior to the
application of the water and the perfection of an appropriation therefor or the
filing of the consent, shall prevent other applications from being allowed and
other canals from being constructed to irrigate the same lands or any of them.
In case of an application for an appropriation of water for the development of
-36-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
water power, the Chief Water Officer department shall promptly act upon such
application and limit the time within which such appropriation shall be
perfected to the period within which the proposed power project can be
completed by uninterrupted and expeditious construction.
Sec. 88. Section 46-235, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-235 (1) For applications other than those to appropriate public waters
for induced ground water recharge, if there is unappropriated water in the
source of supply named in the application, if such application and
appropriation when perfected are not otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare, and if denial of the application is not demanded by the public
interest, the Chief Water Officer department shall approve the application and
shall make a record in its office and return the application to the applicant,
who shall on receipt thereof be authorized to proceed with the work and to take
such measures as may be necessary to perfect such application into an
appropriation. The priority of such application and appropriation when
perfected shall date from the filing of the application with in the Chief Water
Officer office of the department, and the date of filing shall be regarded as
the priority number thereof. The Chief Water Officer department may, upon
examination of such application, approve it for a shorter period of time for
perfecting the proposed appropriation or for a smaller amount of water or of
land than applied for. The Chief Water Officer department may also impose such
other reasonable conditions as the Chief Water Officer it deems appropriate to
protect the public interest. An applicant aggrieved by the action of the Chief
Water Officer department shall, upon proper showing, be granted a hearing
before the Chief Water Officer department, which hearing shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of procedure adopted by the Chief Water Officer
department, and a full and complete record shall be kept of all such
proceedings. When a complete record of the case has been made up, the Chief
Water Officer department shall render an opinion of facts and of law based upon
the evidence before the Chief Water Officer it.
(2)(a) An application for an induced ground water recharge appropriation
for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in service before
September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief Water Officer director if he
or she finds that:
(i) The appropriation is necessary to maintain the well or wells for the
use or uses for which the appropriation has been requested;
(ii) The rate and timing of the flow is the amount reasonably necessary to
maintain the well or wells for the uses for which the appropriation has been
requested; and
(iii) The application is in the public interest and is not detrimental to
the public welfare. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that wells which
are the subject of an application pursuant to subdivision (2)(a) of this
section are in the public interest and are not detrimental to the public
welfare.
(b) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application for a
well or wells constructed before September 9, 1993, but may specifically deny
the applicant the right to request regulation of junior appropriators if the
Chief Water Officer director, at the time of approval, finds that the well or
wells, at the time of their construction, were not located, designed, or
constructed so as to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the
area to minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced
ground water recharge. Thereafter a public water supplier holding an approved
application which has been denied the right to request regulation of junior
appropriators may petition the Chief Water Officer director for a hearing to
present evidence showing the Chief Water Officer director that the well or
wells have been modified, relocated, or reconstructed to take reasonable
advantage of the aquifer conditions in the area. If the Chief Water Officer
director determines that the well or wells have been so modified, relocated, or
reconstructed, the Chief Water Officer director shall cause to be modified the
approval of the application to allow for the regulation of junior
appropriators, subject to the restrictions or conditions applicable to public
water suppliers.
(c) An application for an induced ground water recharge appropriation for
public water supplier wells constructed and placed in service before September
9, 1993, shall not be subject to the requirements of sections 46-288 and
46-289.
(3) An application for an induced ground water recharge appropriation for
public water supplier wells constructed or to be constructed on or after
September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief Water Officer director if he
or she makes the findings required by subdivision (2)(a) of this section and
further finds that:
(a) There is unappropriated water available for the appropriation; and
(b) The well or wells involved have been or will be located and
constructed to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the area to
minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced ground
water recharge.
(4)(a) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application filed
under subsection (2) or (3) of this section for a smaller amount of water than
requested by the applicant. The Chief Water Officer director may also impose
reasonable conditions on the manner and timing of the appropriation which the
Chief Water Officer director deems necessary to protect the public interest.
The Chief Water Officer director may grant an appropriation for specific months
-37-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
of the year if so demanded by the public interest. If the Chief Water Officer
director approves the application, he or she shall issue a written order, which
written order shall include the findings required by this section, the amount
of the appropriation, and any conditions or limitations imposed under this
section.
(b) In determining whether an application for an appropriation for induced
ground water recharge is in the public interest, the Chief Water Officer's
director's considerations shall include, but not be limited to, the possible
adverse effects on existing surface water or ground water users and the
economic, social, and environmental value of such uses, including, but not
limited to, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife, public water supply,
induced ground water recharge for public water supply systems, and water
quality maintenance.
(c) The stream segment and the determination of a reasonable and necessary
amount of water required for induced ground water recharge purposes throughout
the reach shall be defined specifically by the Chief Water Officer director in
the order issued under this section.
Sec. 89. Section 46-235.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-235.01 A public water supplier which has received an appropriation for
induced ground water recharge pursuant to section 46-235 may, from time to time
and within twenty-five years after the priority assigned pursuant to section
46-233, petition the Chief Water Officer department for a hearing to present
evidence showing that all or part of the original projection for additional
water needs specified pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-233 corresponds
with the actual use. To the extent the public water supplier is making
beneficial use of all or a portion of the water projected in the original
application, the right to use such additional water shall vest and the priority
date of such anticipated water use shall date back to the priority date
assigned pursuant to section 46-233. A public water supplier may not request
such a hearing at intervals of less than five years for each approved
application.
Sec. 90. Section 46-235.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-235.02 (1) Just compensation shall be required if a public water
supplier exercises a preference to the injury of a senior appropriator.
(2) Just compensation shall be provided by a public water supplier to any
injured junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected prior to
September 9, 1993, if and to the extent such injury resulted from regulation of
junior appropriators requested by the public water supplier to provide water
for any purpose other than domestic. Such compensation shall not be required to
a junior appropriator if the regulation requested is to provide water for
domestic purposes only. At the time any junior appropriator whose appropriation
was perfected prior to September 9, 1993, is regulated at the request of a
public water supplier, the Chief Water Officer department shall determine for
each such appropriator the extent to which the regulation is for domestic
purposes and the extent to which it is for other purposes.
(3) A cause of action for just compensation shall accrue at the time a
junior appropriator is regulated by the Chief Water Officer department.
Sec. 91. Section 46-235.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-235.03 Natural resources districts shall have the authority to impose
restrictions or controls on public water suppliers as specified in the Nebraska
Ground Water Management and Protection Act. Such restrictions or controls may
limit the withdrawal of ground water to a greater degree or extent than is
otherwise permitted or allowed by a permit issued by the Chief Water Officer
department.
Sec. 92. Section 46-235.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-235.04 (1) Induced ground water recharge appropriations shall be
administered in the same manner as prescribed by Chapter 46, article 2, for
other appropriations. Appropriations for induced ground water recharge may be
canceled and annulled as provided in sections 46-229.02 to 46-229.05.
(2) The Chief Water Officer department may approve the transfer of
priority dates among water wells, including replacement water wells, located
within a single well field that are subject to an induced recharge
appropriation, or are part of an application for such an appropriation, to
improve the well field's efficiency of operation with respect to river flow.
The transfers shall be approved if the Chief Water Officer department finds
that (a) the transfers would not increase the quantity of induced ground water
recharge under the original priority date or application, (b) the amount of
water withdrawn from water wells under the original priority date or
application would not increase, (c) the quantity of streamflow needed to
sustain well field operation under the original priority date would decrease,
(d) the transfer would not impair the rights of other appropriators, and (e)
the transfer is in the public interest in the same manner as provided in
section 46-235. The Chief Water Officer department may assign multiple priority
dates to a single water well that replaces two or more water wells which are
abandoned. Replacement water wells installed pursuant to this subsection must
be installed within the same well field as the abandoned water well. Notice
shall be furnished and any hearing held as provided in sections 46-291 and
46-292. For purposes of this subsection, single well field means those
contiguous tracts of land owned or leased by the applicant containing two or
-38-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
more water wells subject to induced recharge.
Sec. 93. Section 46-236, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-236 An application for appropriation of water for water power shall
meet the requirements of section 46-234 and subsection (1) of section 46-235 to
be approved. Within six months after the approval of an application for water
power and before placing water to any beneficial use, the applicant shall enter
into a contract with the State of Nebraska, through the Chief Water Officer
department, for leasing the use of all water so appropriated. Such lease shall
be upon forms prepared by the Chief Water Officer department, and the time of
such lease shall not run for a greater period than fifty years; and for the use
of water for power purposes the applicant shall pay into the state treasury on
or before January 1 each year fifteen dollars for each one hundred horsepower
for all water so appropriated. Upon application of the lessee or its assigns,
the Chief Water Officer department shall renew the lease so as to continue it
and the water appropriation in full force and effect for an additional period
of fifty years.
Upon the failure of the applicant to comply with any of the provisions of
such lease and the failure to pay any of such fees, the Chief Water Officer
department shall notify the lessee that the required fees have not been paid to
the Chief Water Officer department or that the lessee is not otherwise in
compliance with the provisions of the lease. If the lessee has not come into
compliance with all provisions of the lease or has not paid to the Chief Water
Officer department all required fees within fifteen calendar days after the
date of such notice, the Chief Water Officer department shall issue an order
denying the applicant the right to divert or otherwise use the water
appropriation for power production. The Chief Water Officer department shall
rescind the order denying use of the water appropriation at such time as the
lessee has come into compliance with all provisions of the lease and has paid
all required fees to the Chief Water Officer department. If after forty-five
calendar days from the date of issuance of the order the lessee is not in
compliance with all provisions of the lease or required fees have not been paid
to the Chief Water Officer department, such lease and water appropriation shall
be canceled by the Chief Water Officer department.
Sec. 94. Section 46-237, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-237 (1) Within six months after approval and allowance of an
application other than an application to appropriate public waters for induced
ground water recharge, the applicant shall file with in the Chief Water Officer
office of the department a map or plat which shall conform to the rules and
regulations of the department as to material, size, coloring, and scale. Such
map or plat shall show the source from which the proposed appropriation is to
be taken and all proposed dams, dikes, reservoirs, canals, powerhouses, and
other structures for the purpose of storing, conveying, or using water for any
purpose whatsoever and their true courses or positions in connection with the
boundary lines and corners of lands which they occupy. The lands to be
irrigated shall be identified in the manner prescribed by the department. No
rights shall be deemed to have been acquired until the provisions of this
section have been complied with. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this
section, failure to so comply shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and
all rights thereunder.
(2) For any appropriation with a priority date earlier than 1958 but for
which either the appropriator has failed to comply with the requirements of
subsection (1) of this section or a map or plat required by such subsection has
been lost or destroyed through no fault of the appropriator, the lack of such
compliance or of such map or plat shall not be the basis for an a departmental
adjudication or cancellation of the appropriation by the Chief Water Officer
and the appropriation shall not be subject to legal challenge by any party on
that basis.
(3) The Chief Water Officer department may notify any appropriator subject
to subsection (2) of this section of the need to file a map or plat of lands
under such appropriation. Unless the Chief Water Officer department grants an
extension for good cause shown, the appropriator shall file the required map
within three years after that notification and such map shall conform to the
rules and regulations of the Chief Water Officer department as to material,
size, coloring, and scale. If the appropriator fails to comply, the Chief Water
Officer department may deny the appropriator the right to divert or withdraw
water subject to the appropriation until compliance has been achieved.
Sec. 95. Section 46-238, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-238 (1) Within twelve months after the approval of any application for
water for irrigation, power, or other useful purpose by the Chief Water Officer
department, the person making such application shall commence the excavation or
construction of the works in which it is intended to divert the water and the
actual construction of any water power plant and reservoir or reservoirs for
storage in connection therewith and shall vigorously, diligently, and
uninterruptedly prosecute such work to completion unless temporarily
interrupted by some unavoidable and natural cause. A failure to comply with
this section shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under
the appropriation. The cost of promotion and engineering work shall not be
considered a part of the cost of construction, and the progress of the
construction work shall be such that one-tenth of the total work shall be
completed within one year from the date of approval of the application. The
-39-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
construction of all work required in connection with the proposed project shall
be prosecuted in the manner described in this section and with such a force as
shall assure the average rate of constructional progress necessary to complete
such work or works within the time stipulated in the approval of such
application, notwithstanding the ordinary delays and casualties that must be
expected and provided against. A failure to carry on the construction of either
an irrigation project or a water power project as outlined in this section
shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the
appropriation, and the Chief Water Officer department shall cancel such
appropriation. The Chief Water Officer department shall have free access to all
records, books, and papers of any irrigation or water power company, shall have
the right to go upon the right-of-way and land of any such company, shall
inspect the work to see that it is being done according to plans and
specifications approved by the Chief Water Officer department, and shall also
keep a record of the cost of construction work when deemed advisable for
physical valuation purposes.
(2) The Chief Water Officer department may extend, for reasonable lengths
of time, the time for commencing excavation or construction, completion of
works, the application of water to a beneficial use, or any of the other
requirements for completing or perfecting an application for flow or storage
rights as fixed in the approval of an application or otherwise for the
appropriation of water. Such extension may be granted upon a petition to the
Chief Water Officer department and the showing of reasonable cause. The Chief
Water Officer department shall cause a notice of each petition received to be
published at the petitioner's expense in at least one newspaper of general
circulation in the county or counties of the appropriation once a week for
three consecutive weeks. The Chief Water Officer department shall hold a
hearing on the issue of extension on the Chief Water Officer's its own motion
or if requested by any interested person. If a hearing is held, notice shall be
given by certified mail to the applicant, to any person who requested a
hearing, and to any person who requests notification of the hearing. The Chief
Water Officer department may grant the extension in the absence of a hearing if
no requests for a hearing are received. Any interested person may be made a
party to such action. Any party affected by the decision on the petition may
appeal directly to the Court of Appeals. Subsequent extensions may be made in
the same manner.
Sec. 96. Section 46-240.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-240.01 All appropriators of water for agricultural purposes of less
than the statutory limit of direct flow from the public waters of this state
within the drainage basin of the stream from which such waters originate shall
be entitled to such additional appropriation or appropriations from the direct
flow of such stream, within the statutory limits provided by law, as may be
necessary and required for the production of crops in the practice of good
husbandry. Applications for such supplemental additional appropriations from
the direct flow, upon the approval or granting thereof, shall have priority
within the drainage basin as of the date such applications are filed with in
the Chief Water Officer office of the department.
Sec. 97. Section 46-241, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-241 (1) Every person intending to construct and operate a storage
reservoir for irrigation or any other beneficial purpose or intending to
construct and operate a facility for intentional underground water storage and
recovery shall, except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section
and section 46-243, make an application to the Chief Water Officer department
upon the prescribed form and provide such plans, drawings, and specifications
as are necessary to comply with the Safety of Dams and Reservoirs Act. Such
application shall be filed and proceedings had thereunder in the same manner
and under the same rules and regulations as other applications. Upon the
approval of such application under this section and any approval required by
the act, the applicant shall have the right to construct and impound in such
reservoir, or store in and recover from such underground water storage
facility, all water not otherwise appropriated and any appropriated water not
needed for immediate use, to construct and operate necessary ditches for the
purpose of conducting water to such storage reservoir or facility, and to
condemn land for such reservoir, ditches, or other facility. The procedure to
condemn property shall be exercised in the manner set forth in sections 76-704
to 76-724.
(2) Any person intending to construct an on-channel reservoir with a water
storage impounding capacity of less than fifteen acre-feet measured below the
crest of the lowest open outlet or overflow shall be exempt from subsection (1)
of this section as long as there will be (a) no diversion or withdrawal of
water from the reservoir for any purpose other than for watering range
livestock and (b) no release from the reservoir to provide water for a
downstream diversion or withdrawal for any purpose other than for watering
range livestock. This subsection does not exempt any person from the
requirements of the Safety of Dams and Reservoirs Act or section 54-2425.
(3) Any person intending to construct a reservoir, holding pond, or lagoon
for the sole purpose of holding, managing, or disposing of animal or human
waste shall be exempt from subsection (1) of this section. This subsection does
not exempt any person from any requirements of the Safety of Dams and
Reservoirs Act or section 46-233 or 54-2425.
(4) Every person intending to modify or rehabilitate an existing storage
-40-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
reservoir so that its impounding capacity is to be increased shall comply with
subsection (1) of this section.
(5) The owner of a storage reservoir or facility shall be liable for all
damages arising from leakage or overflow of the water therefrom or from the
breaking of the embankment of such reservoir. The owner or possessor of a
reservoir or intentional underground water storage facility does not have the
right to store water in such reservoir or facility during the time that such
water is required downstream in ditches for direct irrigation or for any
reservoir or facility holding a senior right. Every person who owns, controls,
or operates a reservoir or intentional underground water storage facility,
except political subdivisions of this state, shall be required to pass through
the outlets of such reservoir or facility, whether presently existing or
hereafter constructed, a portion of the measured inflows to furnish water for
livestock in such amounts and at such times as directed by the Chief Water
Officer department to meet the requirements for such purposes as determined by
the Chief Water Officer department, except that a reservoir or facility owner
shall not be required to release water for this purpose which has been legally
stored. Any dam shall be constructed in accordance with the Safety of Dams and
Reservoirs Act, and the outlet works shall be installed so that water may be
released in compliance with this section. The requirement for outlet works may
be waived by the Chief Water Officer department upon a showing of good cause.
Whenever any person diverts water from a public stream and returns it into the
same stream, he or she may take out the same amount of water, less a reasonable
deduction for losses in transit, to be determined by the Chief Water Officer
department, if no prior appropriator for beneficial use is prejudiced by such
diversion.
(6) An application for storage and recovery of water intentionally stored
underground may be made only by an appropriator of record who shows, by
documentary evidence, sufficient interest in the underground water storage
facility to entitle the applicant to the water requested.
Sec. 98. Section 46-242, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-242 (1) After the completion to the satisfaction of the Chief Water
Officer department of a storage reservoir for which a permit has been obtained
pursuant to section 46-241, any person proposing to apply to beneficial use the
water stored shall file with the Chief Water Officer department an application
for a permit particularly describing the use to which the water is to be
applied and, if for irrigation, describing the land to be irrigated.
(2) Application may be made for a permit to appropriate water for the
irrigation of land lying both upstream and downstream from a storage reservoir
or intentional underground water storage facility. Under an approved
application for a permit to appropriate water stored in a reservoir or facility
for use on land upstream from such reservoir or facility, water may be diverted
from the stream by the applicant and a compensating amount of water shall be
released from the reservoir or facility for the use of downstream
appropriators, but the rights of prior appropriators shall not be adversely
affected by such exchange of water.
(3) The owner of a storage reservoir shall have a preferred right to make
such application for a period of six months from the time limited for the
completion of such reservoir. The date of the expiration of such period shall
be endorsed upon the application when allowed. If an application is made by a
person other than the owner of a reservoir at any time, the application shall
not be approved by the Chief Water Officer department until the applicant
shows, by documentary evidence, sufficient interest in such storage reservoir
to entitle the applicant to enough water for the purpose set forth in the
application.
(4) Application may be made for a permit to appropriate water from a
storage reservoir, subject to subsection (3) of this section, or an intentional
underground water storage facility, subject to subsection (6) of section
46-241, for instream use of water for recreation or fish and wildlife if the
appropriation will not prejudice the rights of any prior appropriator for a
beneficial use.
(5) An unapproved application for a permit pursuant to this section which
is pending on August 26, 1983, may be amended to include use of stored water
for intentional underground water storage.
Sec. 99. Section 46-250, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-250 The owner of any ditch, storage reservoir, storage capacity, or
other device for appropriating water may, upon petition to the Chief Water
Officer Department of Natural Resources, and upon its approval, change the
point at which the water under any water appropriation of record is diverted
from a natural stream or reservoir, change the line of any flume, ditch, or
aqueduct, or change a storage site. No reclamation district or power
appropriator may change the established return flow point without the approval
of the Chief Water Officer department.
Sec. 100. Section 46-252, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-252 (1) Any person may conduct, either from outside the state or from
sources located in the state, quantities of water over and above those already
present into or along any of the natural streams or channels of this state, for
purposes of instream beneficial uses or withdrawal of some or all of such water
for out-of-stream beneficial uses, at any point without regard to any prior
appropriation of water from such stream, due allowance being made for losses in
-41-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
transit to be determined by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
Resources. The Chief Water Officer department shall monitor movement of the
water by measurements or other means and shall be responsible for assuring that
such quantities are not subsequently diverted or withdrawn by others unless
they are authorized to do so by the person conducting the water.
(2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, before
any person may conduct water into or along any of the natural streams or
channels of the state, he or she shall first obtain a permit from the Chief
Water Officer department. Application for the permit shall be made on forms
provided by the Chief Water Officer department. Applications shall include
plans and specifications detailing the intended times, amounts, and streamreach
locations and such other information as required by the Chief Water Officer
department. The water subject to such a permit shall be deemed appropriated for
the use specified in the permit. Permitholders shall be liable for any damages
resulting from the overflow of such stream or channel when water so conducted
contributed to such overflow.
(3) Any person actually engaged in the construction or operation of any
water power plant may, without filing with the Chief Water Officer department
and upon payment of all damages, use any such stream or channel for a tailrace
or canal and may, whenever necessary, widen, deepen, or straighten the bed of
any such stream. All damages resulting therefrom shall be determined in the
manner set forth in sections 76-704 to 76-724.
(4) Any person holding a storage use permit pursuant to section 46-242
shall not be required to obtain the permit required by this section.
(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt a person from
obtaining any other permits required by law.
Sec. 101. Section 46-254, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-254 Any person owning or in control of any ditch, reservoir, or other
device for appropriating or using water who willfully opens, closes, changes,
or interferes with any headgate or controlling gate, or by any method or means
takes any water from any natural stream, reservoir, or other source, through
any ditch or canal to any land or lands, or allows the same to be done, or uses
or allows to be used any water upon any land or lands, or for any other purpose
whatsoever, without authority from the Chief Water Officer Department of
Natural Resources, or who stores water in or releases water from a reservoir
other than in compliance with orders of the Chief Water Officer Director of
Natural Resources or his or her representative, shall be guilty of a Class II
misdemeanor. Each day that the water is allowed to run without authority from
the Chief Water Officer department shall constitute a separate offense.
Sec. 102. Section 46-256, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-256 Persons owning or controlling any ditch, canal, or reservoir for
the purpose of storing or using water for any purpose shall, upon thirty days'
notice by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources, construct
and maintain at the point of diversion a substantial headgate, of a design
approved by the Chief Water Officer department, so built that it may be closed,
or partially closed and fastened at any stage with lock or seal. They shall
also construct a device for measuring and apportioning the water appropriated,
which device shall be of a design approved by the Chief Water Officer
department and built at the most practical point to be selected and fixed by
the Chief Water Officer it. If they neglect or refuse, for a period of ten
days, to construct such headgate and measuring device, the Chief Water Officer
department shall refuse to allow any water to be delivered to or used by or
through any such ditch, canal, or reservoir or any other contrivance or device
for appropriating, using, or storing water, and the Chief Water Officer
department may construct bars, dams, or other obstructions to prevent such
delivery or use.
Sec. 103. Section 46-258, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-258 Any owner or person in control of any ditch for irrigation purposes
shall have the ditch in order to receive water from the source of supply on or
before April 15 of each year, shall construct necessary outlets in the banks
for the delivery of water to all persons who are entitled to the same, and
shall maintain a substantial headgate and measuring box or weir at the head of
each lateral, which shall be constructed in accordance with plans and
specifications approved by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
Resources. A multiplicity of outlets shall be avoided. The outlet shall be at
the most convenient and practicable point consistent with the protection and
safety of the ditch and the efficient distribution of water among the various
claimants thereof.
Sec. 104. Section 46-261, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-261 (1) The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources may
require an appropriator or his or her agent to furnish the Chief Water Officer
department, by April 1 in any year, a list or map of all lands to be irrigated,
the acreage of each tract, and the names of the owners, controllers, or
officers for every ditch, reservoir, or other device for appropriating,
diverting, carrying, or distributing water to be used as a basis for the
distribution of water until April 1 of the following year, and if so ordered
such a list or map shall be furnished by the appropriator or his or her agent
to the Chief Water Officer department.
(2) By April 1, any district or company which has transferred an
-42-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
appropriation pursuant to sections 46-2,127 to 46-2,129 in the previous
calendar year shall provide the Chief Water Officer department:
(a) A legal description and list or map of the tracts of land receiving
and transferring an appropriation of water, or portion thereof, within the
district or company;
(b) The water appropriation permit number under sections 46-233 to 46-235
and the priority date of the water appropriation;
(c) A statement on whether objections were filed, whether a hearing was
held, and how consent was given;
(d) The effective date of the transfer of the appropriation; and
(e) A statement summarizing the water use on the receiving and
transferring tracts of land.
(3) The Chief Water Officer department may require the owner or controller
of any canal or ditch to install an approved recording gauge at one or more
specific locations to record the amount of water used.
(4) For any appropriation not held by an irrigation district, a
reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district, or a mutual
irrigation or canal company, the Chief Water Officer department may require the
owner of an appropriation for irrigation purposes to provide the Chief Water
Officer department with any or all of the following information relative to the
use of water under the appropriation during the previous irrigation season: (a)
A list or map of all lands irrigated; (b) the acreage of each tract irrigated;
(c) the rate at which water was diverted; (d) the amount diverted; (e) for any
lands under the appropriation that were not irrigated, any sufficient cause, as
described in section 46-229.04, which the appropriator claims was the reason
for such nonuse; and (f) any other information needed by the Chief Water
Officer department to properly monitor and administer use of water under the
appropriation. If the appropriator claims sufficient cause for nonuse, he or
she shall also provide the Chief Water Officer department with any evidence the
Chief Water Officer department requires as a condition for accepting such
claimed cause as sufficient cause to excuse nonuse.
(5) The Chief Water Officer department may deny an appropriator the right
to any water to be delivered to or used by or through any ditch, reservoir, or
other contrivance for the appropriation, use, or storage of water if the
appropriator is not in compliance with this section, with subsection (2) of
section 46-230, or with any conditions of any permit, notice, or order of the
Chief Water Officer department concerning the appropriation. The Chief Water
Officer department may construct bars or dams or may install such other devices
as are necessary to prevent such delivery or use.
Sec. 105. Section 46-263.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-263.02 The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources is
hereby authorized and empowered to offer and pay out of the fees collected by
the Chief Water Officer department rewards of not to exceed twenty-five dollars
in any case for the apprehension and conviction of any person or persons
violating the provisions of section 46-263.01.
Sec. 106. Section 46-273, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-273 The United States of America is hereby authorized, in conformity to
the laws of the State of Nebraska, to appropriate, develop, and store any
unappropriated flood or unused waters, in connection with any project
constructed by the United States pursuant to the provisions of an Act of
Congress approved June 17, 1902, being An Act providing for the reclamation of
arid lands (32 Stat. L. 388), and all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental
thereto. When the officers of the United States Bureau of Reclamation determine
that any water so developed or stored is in excess of the needs of the project
as then completed or is flood or unused water, the United States may contract
to furnish such developed, stored, flood, or unused water, under the terms and
conditions imposed by Act of Congress and the rules and regulations of the
United States, to any person who may have theretofore been granted a permit to
appropriate a portion of the normal flow of any stream, if the water so
appropriated shall, during some portion of the year, be found insufficient for
the needs of the land to which it is appurtenant. The United States and every
person entering into a contract as herein provided shall have the right to
conduct such water into and along any of the natural streams of the state, but
not so as to raise the waters thereof above the ordinary high water mark, and
may take out the same again at any point desired, without regard to the prior
rights of others to water from the same stream; but due allowance shall be made
for losses in transit, the amount of such allowance to be determined by the
Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources. The Chief Water Officer
department shall supervise and enforce the distribution of such water so
delivered with like authority and under the same provisions as in the case of
general appropriators.
Sec. 107. Section 46-286, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-286 An ephemeral natural stream shall mean that portion of a natural
stream in which water flows only after a precipitation event or when augmented
by surface water runoff caused by the pumping of ground water for irrigation.
The portion of a natural stream that is shown as an intermittent stream on the
most recent United States Geological Survey topographic quadrangle map
published prior to July 18, 2008, shall be considered an ephemeral natural
stream unless the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources has
investigated the stream and determined that the stream or a reach of the stream
-43-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
is perennial or intermittent and subject to Chapter 46, article 2. The Chief
Water Officer's department's determination for the purposes of this section
shall be adopted and promulgated in rule or regulation.
Sec. 108. Section 46-288, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-288 For purposes of this section and section 46-289, unless the context
otherwise requires:
(1) Basin of origin shall mean the river basin in which the point or
proposed point of diversion of water is located;
(2) Beneficial use shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable and
efficient use of water for domestic, municipal, agricultural, industrial,
commercial, power production, subirrigation, fish and wildlife, ground water
recharge, interstate compact, water quality maintenance, or recreational
purposes. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to affect the
preferences for use of surface water as provided in section 46-204;
(3) Interbasin transfer shall mean the diversion of water in one river
basin and the transportation of such water to another river basin for storage
or utilization for a beneficial use; and
(4) River basin shall mean any of the following natural hydrologic basins
of the state as shown on maps located in the Department of Water, Energy, and
Environment Natural Resources: (a) The White River and Hat Creek basin; (b) the
Niobrara River basin; (c) the Platte River basin, including the North Platte
and South Platte River basins, except that for purposes of transfer between the
North and South Platte River basins each shall be considered a separate river
basin; (d) the Loup River basin; (e) the Elkhorn River basin; (f) the
Republican River basin; (g) the Little Blue River basin; (h) the Big Blue River
basin; (i) the Nemaha River basin; and (j) the Missouri tributaries basin.
Sec. 109. Section 46-289, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-289 The Legislature finds, recognizes, and declares that the transfer
of water to outside the boundaries of a river basin may have impacts on the
water and other resources in the basin and that such impacts differ from those
caused by uses of water within the same basin in part because any unused water
will not be returned to the stream from which it is taken for further use in
that river basin. The Legislature therefor recognizes the need to delineate
factors for consideration by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of
Water, Energy, and Environment Director of Natural Resources when evaluating an
application made pursuant to section 46-233 which involves an interbasin
transfer of water in order to determine whether denial of such application is
demanded by the public interest. Those considerations shall include, but not be
limited to, the following factors:
(1) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
interbasin transfer and use;
(2) Any adverse impacts of the proposed interbasin transfer and use;
(3) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated water in
the basin of origin;
(4) Any reasonably foreseeable future beneficial uses of the water in the
basin of origin;
(5) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of leaving the water
in the basin of origin for current or future beneficial uses;
(6) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant; and
(7) Alternative sources of water available to the basin of origin for
future beneficial uses.
The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the overall
benefits to the state and the applicant's basin are greater than or equal to
the adverse impacts to the state and the basin of origin. The Chief Water
Officer's director's order granting or denying an application shall specify the
reasons for such action, including a discussion of the required factors for
consideration, and shall document such decision by reference to the hearing
record, if any, and to any other sources used by the Chief Water Officer
director in making the decision.
Sec. 110. Section 46-290, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-290 (1)(a) Except as provided in this section and sections 46-2,120 to
46-2,130, any person having a permit to appropriate water for beneficial
purposes issued pursuant to sections 46-233 to 46-235, 46-240.01, 46-241,
46-242, or 46-637 and who desires (i) to transfer the use of such appropriation
to a location other than the location specified in the permit, (ii) to change
that appropriation to a different type of appropriation as provided in
subsection (3) of this section, or (iii) to change the purpose for which the
water is to be used under a natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriation
to a purpose not at that time permitted under the appropriation shall apply for
approval of such transfer or change to the Chief Water Officer Department of
Natural Resources.
(b) The application for such approval shall contain (i) the number
assigned to such appropriation by the Chief Water Officer department, (ii) the
name and address of the present holder of the appropriation, (iii) if
applicable, the name and address of the person or entity to whom the
appropriation would be transferred or who will be the user of record after a
change in the location of use, type of appropriation, or purpose of use under
the appropriation, (iv) the legal description of the land to which the
appropriation is now appurtenant, (v) the name and address of each holder of a
mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent consensual security interest against
-44-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
the tract or tracts of land to which the appropriation is now appurtenant, (vi)
if applicable, the legal description of the land to which the appropriation is
proposed to be transferred, (vii) if a transfer is proposed, whether other
sources of water are available at the original location of use and whether any
provisions have been made to prevent either use of a new source of water at the
original location or increased use of water from any existing source at that
location, (viii) if applicable, the legal descriptions of the beginning and end
of the stream reach to which the appropriation is proposed to be transferred
for the purpose of augmenting the flows in that stream reach, (ix) if a
proposed transfer is for the purpose of increasing the quantity of water
available for use pursuant to another appropriation, the number assigned to
such other appropriation by the Chief Water Officer department, (x) the purpose
of the current use, (xi) if a change in purpose of use is proposed, the
proposed purpose of use, (xii) if a change in the type of appropriation is
proposed, the type of appropriation to which a change is desired, (xiii) if a
proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, the duration of the
proposed transfer or change, and (xiv) such other information as the Chief
Water Officer department by rule and regulation requires.
(2) If a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, a copy
of the proposed agreement between the current appropriator and the person who
is to be responsible for use of water under the appropriation while the
transfer or change is in effect shall be submitted at the same time as the
application.
(3) Regardless of whether a transfer or a change in the purpose of use is
involved, the following changes in type of appropriation, if found by the Chief
Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of
Natural Resources to be consistent with section 46-294, may be approved subject
to the following:
(a) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use may be
changed to a natural-flow appropriation for aboveground reservoir storage or
for intentional underground water storage;
(b) A natural-flow appropriation for intentional underground water storage
may be changed to a natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use or
for aboveground reservoir storage;
(c) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water storage may
be changed to an instream appropriation subject to sections 46-2,107 to
46-2,119 if the Chief Water Officer director determines that the resulting
instream appropriation would be consistent with subdivisions (2), (3), and (4)
of section 46-2,115;
(d) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water storage may
be changed to an appropriation for induced ground water recharge if the Chief
Water Officer director determines that the resulting appropriation for induced
ground water recharge would be consistent with subdivisions (2)(a)(i) and (ii)
of section 46-235;
(e) An appropriation for the manufacturing of hydropower at a facility
located on a natural stream channel may be permanently changed in full to an
instream basin-management appropriation to be held jointly by the Game and
Parks Commission and any natural resources district or combination of natural
resources districts. The beneficial use of such change is to maintain the
streamflow for fish, wildlife, and recreation that was available from the
manufacturing of hydropower prior to the change. Such changed appropriation may
also be utilized by the owners of the appropriation to assist in the
implementation of an approved integrated management plan or plans developed
pursuant to sections 46-714 to 46-718 for each natural resources district
within the river basin. Any such change under this section shall be subject to
review under sections 46-229 to 46-229.06 to ensure that the beneficial uses of
the change of use are still being achieved; and
(f) The incidental underground water storage portion, whether or not
previously quantified, of a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation may be
separated from the direct-use portion of the appropriation and may be changed
to a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation for intentional underground
water storage at the same location if the historic consumptive use of the
direct-use portion of the appropriation is transferred to another location or
is terminated, but such a separation and change may be approved only if, after
the separation and change, (i) the total permissible diversion under the
appropriation will not increase, (ii) the projected consequences of the
separation and change are consistent with the provisions of any integrated
management plan adopted in accordance with section 46-718 or 46-719 for the
geographic area involved, and (iii) if the location of the proposed intentional
underground water storage is in a river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
overappropriated in accordance with section 46-713, the integrated management
plan for that river basin, subbasin, or reach has gone into effect, and that
plan requires that the amount of the intentionally stored water that is
consumed after the change will be no greater than the amount of the
incidentally stored water that was consumed prior to the change. Approval of a
separation and change pursuant to this subdivision (f) shall not exempt any
consumptive use associated with the incidental recharge right from any
reduction in water use required by an integrated management plan for a river
basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated in accordance with
section 46-713.
Whenever any change in type of appropriation is approved pursuant to this
-45-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
subsection and as long as that change remains in effect, the appropriation
shall be subject to the statutes, rules, and regulations that apply to the type
of appropriation to which the change has been made.
(4) The Legislature finds that induced ground water recharge
appropriations issued pursuant to sections 46-233 and 46-235 and instream
appropriations issued pursuant to section 46-2,115 are specific to the location
identified in the appropriation. Neither type of appropriation shall be
transferred to a different location, changed to a different type of
appropriation, or changed to permit a different purpose of use.
(5) In addition to any other purposes for which transfers and changes may
be approved, such transfers and changes may be approved if the purpose is (a)
to maintain or augment the flow in a specific stream reach for any instream use
that the Chief Water Officer department has determined, through rules and
regulations, to be a beneficial use or (b) to increase the frequency that a
diversion rate or rate of flow specified in another valid appropriation is
achieved.
For any transfer or change approved pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall be provided with a report
at least every five years while such transfer or change is in effect. The
purpose of such report shall be to indicate whether the beneficial instream use
for which the flow is maintained or augmented continues to exist. If the report
indicates that it does not or if no report is filed within sixty days after the
Chief Water Officer's department's notice to the appropriator that the deadline
for filing the report has passed, the Chief Water Officer department may cancel
the its approval of the transfer or change and such appropriation shall revert
to the same location of use, type of appropriation, and purpose of use as prior
to such approval.
(6) A quantified or unquantified appropriation for incidental underground
water storage may be transferred to a new location along with the direct-use
appropriation with which it is recognized if the Chief Water Officer director
finds such transfer to be consistent with section 46-294 and determines that
the geologic and other relevant conditions at the new location are such that
incidental underground water storage will occur at the new location. The Chief
Water Officer director may request such information from the applicant as is
needed to make such determination and may modify any such quantified
appropriation for incidental underground water storage, if necessary, to
reflect the geologic and other conditions at the new location.
(7) Unless an incidental underground water storage appropriation is
changed as authorized by subdivision (3)(f) of this section or is transferred
as authorized by subsection (6) of this section or subsection (1) of section
46-291, such appropriation shall be canceled or modified, as appropriate, by
the Chief Water Officer director to reflect any reduction in water that will be
stored underground as the result of a transfer or change of the direct-use
appropriation with which the incidental underground water storage was
recognized prior to the transfer or change.
(8) Any appropriation for manufacturing of hydropower changed under
subdivision (3)(e) of this section shall maintain the priority date and
preference category of the original manufacturing appropriation and shall be
subject to condemnation and subordination pursuant to sections 70-668 and
70-669. Any person holding a subordination agreement that was established prior
to such change of appropriation shall be entitled to enter into a new
subordination agreement for terms consistent with the original subordination
agreement at no additional cost. Any person having obtained a condemnation
award that was established prior to such change of appropriation shall be
entitled to the same benefits created by such award, and any obligations
created by such award shall become the obligations of the new owner of the
appropriation changed under this section.
Sec. 111. Section 46-291, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-291 (1) Upon receipt of an application filed under section 46-290 for a
transfer in the location of use of an appropriation, the Chief Water Officer
Department of Natural Resources shall review it for compliance with this
subsection. The Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources may approve
the application without notice or hearing if he or she determines that: (a) The
appropriation is used and will continue to be used exclusively for irrigation
purposes; (b) the only lands involved in the proposed transfer are (i) lands
within the quarter section of land to which the appropriation is appurtenant,
(ii) lands within such quarter section of land and one or more quarter sections
of land each of which is contiguous to the quarter section of land to which the
appropriation is appurtenant, or (iii) lands within the boundaries or service
area of and capable of service by the same irrigation district, reclamation
district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal
company; (c) after the transfer, the total number of acres irrigated under the
appropriation will be no greater than the number of acres that could legally be
irrigated under the appropriation prior to the transfer; (d) all the land
involved in the transfer is under the same ownership or is within the same
irrigation district, reclamation district, public power and irrigation
district, or mutual irrigation or canal company; (e) the transfer will not
result in a change in the point of diversion or the point of diversion will be
changed but the change meets the following requirements: (i) The new point of
diversion is on the same named stream, the same tributary, or the same river or
creek as the approved point of diversion; (ii) the proposed point of diversion
will not move above or below an existing diversion point owned by another
-46-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
appropriator; and (iii) the proposed point of diversion will not move above or
below a tributary stream or a constructed river return or a constructed drain;
and (f) the transfer will not diminish the water supply available for or
otherwise adversely affect any other surface water appropriator. If transfer of
an appropriation with associated incidental underground water storage is
approved in accordance with this subsection, the associated incidental
underground water storage also may be transferred pursuant to this subsection
as long as such transfer would continue to be consistent with the requirements
of this subsection. If necessary, the boundaries of the incidental underground
water storage area may be modified to reflect any change in the location of
that storage consistent with such a transfer. Transfers shall not be approved
pursuant to this subsection until the Chief Water Officer department has
adopted and promulgated rules and regulations establishing the criteria the
Chief Water Officer it will use to determine whether proposed transfers are
consistent with subdivision (1)(f) of this section.
(2) If after reviewing an application filed under section 46-290 the Chief
Water Officer director determines that it cannot be approved pursuant to
subsection (1) of this section, he or she shall cause a notice of such
application to be posted on the department's website of the Department of
Water, Energy, and Environment, to be sent by certified mail to each holder of
a mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent consensual security interest that
is identified by the applicant pursuant to subdivision (1)(b)(v) of section

used for purposes of diversion or delivery of water under the appropriation,
and to be published at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
each county containing lands to which the appropriation is appurtenant and, if
applicable, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in each county
containing lands to which the appropriation is proposed to be transferred.
(3) The notice shall contain: (a) A description of the appropriation; (b)
the number assigned to such appropriation in the records of the department; (c)
the date of priority; (d) if applicable, a description of the land or stream
reach to which such water appropriation is proposed to be transferred; (e) if
applicable, the type of appropriation to which the appropriation is proposed to
be changed; (f) if applicable, the proposed change in the purpose of use; (g)
whether the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent or temporary and, if
temporary, the duration of the proposed transfer or change; and (h) any other
information the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant and essential to
provide the interested public with adequate notice of the proposed transfer or
change.
(4) The notice shall state (a) that any interested person may object to
and request a hearing on the application by filing such objections in writing
specifically stating the grounds for each objection and (b) that any such
objection and request shall be filed with in the Chief Water Officer office of
the department within two weeks after the date of final publication of the
notice.
(5) Within the time period allowed by this section for the filing of
objections and requests for hearings, the county board of any county containing
land to which the appropriation is appurtenant and, if applicable, the county
board of any county containing land to which the appropriation is proposed to
be transferred may provide the Chief Water Officer department with comments
about the potential economic impacts of the proposed transfer or change in such
county. The filing of any such comments by a county board shall not make the
county a party in the application process, but such comments shall be
considered by the Chief Water Officer director in determining pursuant to
section 46-294 whether the proposed transfer or change is in the public
interest.
Sec. 112. Section 46-292, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-292 The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources may hold a
hearing on an application filed under section 46-290 on the Chief Water
Officer's its own motion and shall hold a hearing if a timely request therefor
is filed by any interested person in accordance with section 46-291. Any such
hearing shall be subject to section 61-206.
Sec. 113. Section 46-293, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-293 (1) The Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
Environment Director of Natural Resources shall independently review each
application subject to subsection (2) of section 46-291 to determine whether
the requirements of section 46-294 will be met if the transfer or change is
approved. The requirement of this subsection is not altered when there are
objectors who have become parties to the proposed transfer or change, but if a
hearing is called by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources on
the Chief Water Officer's its own motion or as the result of a request therefor
filed in accordance with subsection (4) of section 46-291, any evidence
considered by the Chief Water Officer director in making such determinations
shall be made a part of the record of the hearing as provided in section
84-914.
(2) Either on his or her own motion or in response to objections or
comments received pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of section 46-291, the
Chief Water Officer director may require the applicant to provide additional
information before a hearing will be scheduled or, if no hearing is to be held,
before the application will receive further consideration. The information
-47-

requested may include economic, social, or environmental impact analyses of the
proposed transfer or change, information about the amount of water historically
consumed under the appropriation, copies of any plans for mitigation of any
anticipated adverse impacts that would result from the proposed transfer or
change, and such other information as the Chief Water Officer director deems
necessary in order to determine whether the proposed transfer or change is
consistent with section 46-294.
Sec. 114. Section 46-294, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-294 (1) Except for applications approved in accordance with subsection
(1) of section 46-291, the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water,
Energy, and Environment Director of Natural Resources shall approve an
application filed pursuant to section 46-290 only if the application and the
proposed transfer or change meet the following requirements:
(a) The application is complete and all other information requested
pursuant to section 46-293 has been provided;
(b) The proposed use of water after the transfer or change will be a
beneficial use of water;
(c)(i) Any requested transfer in the location of use is within the same
river basin as defined in section 46-288 or (ii) the river basin from which the
appropriation is to be transferred is tributary to the river basin to which the
appropriation is to be transferred;
(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, the
proposed transfer or change, alone or when combined with any new or increased
use of any other source of water at the original location or within the same
irrigation district, reclamation district, public power and irrigation
district, or mutual irrigation or canal company for the original or other
purposes, will not diminish the supply of water available for or otherwise
adversely affect any other water appropriator and will not significantly
adversely affect any riparian water user who files an objection in writing
pursuant to section 46-291;
(e) The quantity of water that is transferred for diversion or other use
at the new location will not exceed the historic consumptive use under the
appropriation or portion thereof being transferred, except that this
subdivision does not apply to (i) a transfer in the location of use if both the
current use and the proposed use are for irrigation, the number of acres to be
irrigated will not increase after the transfer, and the location of the
diversion from the stream will not change or (ii) a transfer or change in the
purpose of use of a surface water irrigation appropriation as provided for in
subsection (3), (5), or (6) of section 46-290 if the transfer or change in
purpose will not diminish the supply of water available or otherwise adversely
affect any other water appropriator, adversely affect Nebraska's ability to
meet its obligations under a multistate agreement, or result in administration
of the prior appropriation system by the Chief Water Officer Department of
Natural Resources, which would not have otherwise occurred;
(f) The appropriation, prior to the transfer or change, is not subject to
termination or cancellation pursuant to sections 46-229 to 46-229.04;
(g) If a proposed transfer or change is of an appropriation that has been
used for irrigation and is in the name of an irrigation district, reclamation
district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal
company or is dependent upon any such district's or company's facilities for
water delivery, such district or company has approved the transfer or change;
(h) If the proposed transfer or change is of a storage-use appropriation
and if the owner of that appropriation is different from the owner of the
associated storage appropriation, the owner of the storage appropriation has
approved the transfer or change;
(i) If the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent, either (i) the
purpose for which the water is to be used before the transfer or change is in
the same preference category established by section 46-204 as the purpose for
which the water is to be used after the transfer or change or (ii) the purpose
for which the water is to be used before the transfer or change and the purpose
for which the water is to be used after the transfer or change are both
purposes for which no preferences are established by section 46-204;
(j) If the proposed transfer or change is to be temporary, it will be for
a duration of no less than one year and, except as provided in section
46-294.02, no more than thirty years;
(k) The transfer or change will not be inconsistent with any applicable
state or federal law and will not jeopardize the state's compliance with any
applicable interstate water compact or decree or cause difficulty in fulfilling
the provisions of any other formal state contract or agreement; and
(l) The proposed transfer or change is in the public interest. The Chief
Water Officer's director's considerations relative to the public interest shall
include, but not be limited to, (i) the economic, social, and environmental
impacts of the proposed transfer or change and (ii) whether and under what
conditions other sources of water are available for the uses to be made of the
appropriation after the proposed transfer or change. The Chief Water Officer
Department of Natural Resources shall adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations to govern the Chief Water Officer's director's determination of
whether a proposed transfer or change is in the public interest.
(2) The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed transfer or
change will comply with subdivisions (1)(a) through (l) of this section, except
that (a) the burden is on a riparian user to demonstrate his or her riparian
status and to demonstrate a significant adverse effect on his or her use in
-48-

2025 2025
order to prevent approval of an application and (b) if both the current use and
the proposed use after a transfer are for irrigation, the number of acres to be
irrigated will not increase after the transfer, and the location of the
diversion from the stream will not change, there is a rebuttable presumption
that the transfer will be consistent with subdivision (1)(d) of this section.
(3) In approving an application, the Chief Water Officer director may
impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to protect the public
interest, to ensure consistency with any of the other criteria in subsection
(1) of this section, or to provide the Chief Water Officer department with
information needed to properly and efficiently administer the appropriation
while the transfer or change remains in effect. If necessary to prevent
diminution of supply for any other appropriator, the conditions imposed by the
Chief Water Officer director shall require that historic return flows be
maintained or replaced in quantity, timing, and location. After approval of any
such transfer or change, the appropriation shall be subject to all water use
restrictions and requirements in effect at any new location of use and, if
applicable, at any new diversion location. An appropriation for which a
transfer or change has been approved shall retain the same priority date as
that of the original appropriation. If an approved transfer or change is
temporary, the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation shall
revert to the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation prior
to the transfer or change.
(4) In approving an application for a transfer, the Chief Water Officer
director may also authorize the overlying of water appropriations on the same
lands, except that if any such overlying of appropriations would result in
either the authorized diversion rate or the authorized aggregate annual
quantity that could be diverted to be greater than is otherwise permitted by
section 46-231, the Chief Water Officer director shall limit the total
diversion rate or aggregate annual quantity for the appropriations overlain to
the rate or quantity that he or she determines is necessary, in the exercise of
good husbandry, for the production of crops on the land involved. The Chief
Water Officer director may also authorize a greater number of acres to be
irrigated if the amount and rate of water approved under the original
appropriation is not increased by the change of location. An increase in the
number of acres to be irrigated shall be approved only if (a) such an increase
will not diminish the supply of water available to or otherwise adversely
affect another water appropriator or (b) the transfer would not adversely
affect the water supply for any river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been
designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined to be
fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 and (i) the number of acres
authorized under the appropriation when originally approved has not been
increased previously, (ii) the increase in the number of acres irrigated will
not exceed five percent of the number of acres being irrigated under the permit
before the proposed transfer or a total of ten acres, whichever acreage is
less, and (iii) all the use will be either on the quarter section to which the
appropriation was appurtenant before the transfer or on an adjacent quarter
section.
Sec. 115. Section 46-294.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-294.01 Whenever a temporary transfer is approved in accordance with
sections 46-290 to 46-294, the applicant shall, within sixty days after the
order of approval of the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources,
cause copies of the following to be filed with the county clerk or register of
deeds of the county in which the land subject to the appropriation prior to the
transfer is located: (1) The permit by which the appropriation was established;
(2) the agreement by which the temporary transfer is to be effected; and (3)
the order of the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources approving
the temporary transfer. Whenever renewal of a temporary transfer is approved
pursuant to section 46-294.02, the applicant shall, within sixty days after
such approval, cause a copy of the order of the Chief Water Officer director
approving such renewal to be filed with the county clerk or register of deeds
of such county. Such documents shall be indexed to the land subject to the
appropriation prior to the transfer. The applicant shall file with the Chief
Water Officer department, within ninety days after the Chief Water Officer's
department's order of approval, proof of filing with the county clerk or
register of deeds. Failure to file such proof of filing within such ninety-day
time period shall be grounds for the Chief Water Officer director to negate any
prior approval of the transfer or renewal.
Sec. 116. Section 46-294.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-294.02 A temporary transfer or a change in the type or purpose of use
of an appropriation may be renewed or otherwise extended by the parties thereto
at any time following the midpoint of the transfer or change term, but any such
renewal or extension is subject to review and approval pursuant to sections
46-290 to 46-294. No renewal or extension shall cause the term of any such
temporary transfer or change to exceed thirty years in duration from the date
the renewal or extension is approved by the Chief Water Officer of the
Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of Natural Resources.
Sec. 117. Section 46-294.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-294.05 The Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
Environment Director of Natural Resources may adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations to carry out sections 46-290 to 46-294.04.

following the last such review, whichever is later, and such notice shall be
mailed to the appropriator of record and posted on the department's website.
The notice shall state that any interested person may file comments relating to
the review of the instream appropriation or may request a hearing to present
evidence relevant to such review. Any such comments or request for hearing
shall be filed with in the Chief Water Officer headquarters office of the
department within six weeks after the date of final publication of the notice.
The appropriator of record shall, within the six-week period, file written
documentation of the continued use of the appropriation. If no requests for
hearing are received and if the Chief Water Officer director is satisfied with
the information provided by the appropriator of record that the appropriation
continues to be beneficially used and is in the public interest, the Chief
Water Officer director shall issue an order stating such findings. If requested
by any interested person, or on his or her own motion based on the comments and
information filed, the Chief Water Officer director shall schedule a hearing.
If a hearing is held, the purpose of the hearing shall be to receive evidence
regarding whether the water appropriated under the permit still provides the
beneficial uses for which the permit was granted and whether the permit is
still in the public interest. The hearing shall proceed under the rebuttable
presumption that the appropriation continues to provide the beneficial uses for
which the permit was granted and that the appropriation is in the public
interest. After the hearing, the Chief Water Officer director may by order

Sec. 131. Section 46-2,116, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-2,116 In determining whether an application for an instream
appropriation is in the public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall
consider the following factors:
(1) The economic, social, and environmental value of the instream use or
uses including, but not limited to, recreation, fish and wildlife, induced
recharge for municipal water systems, and water quality maintenance; and
(2) The economic, social, and environmental value of reasonably
foreseeable alternative out-of-stream uses of water that will be foregone or
accorded junior status if the appropriation is granted.
Sec. 132. Section 46-2,116.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-2,116.01 If the Chief Water Officer director determines that there is
insufficient unappropriated natural flow available for an application for an
instream appropriation and if the applicant consents, the Chief Water Officer
department may conduct a study to determine whether the instream flow needs can
be met through the use of stored water in new storage facilities. The study
shall address the availability of storage sites, the estimated cost of
providing any required storage, and such other findings and conclusions as the
Chief Water Officer department deems appropriate.
Sec. 133. Section 46-2,116.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
46-2,116.02 If the Chief Water Officer department determines that instream

the parties have completed mediation or nonbinding arbitration. Mediation or
nonbinding arbitration shall be deemed completed when the person retained to
conduct the mediation or nonbinding arbitration has concluded further efforts
would probably not result in resolution of major issues. The costs of mediation
or nonbinding arbitration shall be shared by the parties.

Sec. 167. Section 46-541, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-541 The board shall have power on behalf of the district:
(1) To have perpetual succession, except that all districts organized
prior to January 1, 1950, which have not entered into a bona fide construction
of their works shall, within fifteen years following January 1, 1961, cause to
be submitted to the qualified electors of the district the following question:
Shall the district be continued for an additional fifteen years?
.... Yes
.... No
The election shall be held in the same manner set out in section 46-564
relating to submission to qualified electors for the approval of bonded
indebtedness.
In the event a majority of the qualified voters voting in such election
vote yes, then such district shall be continued for an additional fifteen
years. For all districts organized after January 1, 1950, and not having
entered into a bona fide construction of their works before January 1, 1961,
the directors shall, within fifteen years following January 1, 1961, cause to
be submitted the same question to the qualified electors of the district. All
districts organized after November 1, 1953, which have not entered into a bona
fide construction of their works within fifteen years after the first day of
July of the year of assessment of the taxable property of the district shall
submit to the qualified electors of the district the question of whether the
district shall be continued for an additional fifteen years. If a district has
pending before the Congress of the United States a bill for the authorization
or reauthorization of its project at the expiration of any one of such fifteen-
year periods, the district shall be continued until such authorization or
reauthorization is granted by the Congress of the United States and
appropriations made for the actual construction of its work, which additional
period shall not exceed ten years from the expiration of the fifteen-year
period.
If at the end of the fifteen-year period, plus the additional ten-year
period granted while its project is pending before the Congress of the United
States for authorization or reauthorization and an appropriation for the actual
construction of its works, no physical construction of any of its works has
been started, then the same question shall again be submitted to the qualified
electors. In the event a majority of the qualified voters voting in such
election vote yes, then such district shall be continued for an additional
fifteen years.
In the event of a failure to receive a majority affirmative vote of the
voters voting in such election, the district shall be dissolved and the
district shall submit to the Chief Water Officer department a full and complete
audit by a public accountant showing the assets possessed by the district.
Thereupon the Chief Water Officer department shall enter an order providing
that within sixty days the assets of such district shall be liquidated, all
rights granted by the Chief Water Officer department shall be canceled, and any
assets on hand shall be divided as follows:
(a) All bills payable and all expenses of dissolution shall be deducted
from the assets and paid; and
(b) The balance remaining shall be divided proportionately among the
operating public school districts of the district in the proportion that the
number of acres in each school district bears to the total number of acres of
all of the school districts within the boundaries of the district. If the
district is confined to one county, distribution shall be made by the county
treasurer of such county. If the district extends into more than one county,
the funds for disbursement to such school districts shall be paid to the county
within which the schoolhouses are located for distribution to such school
districts;
(2) To take by appropriation, grant, purchase, bequest, devise, or lease,
and to hold and enjoy water rights and waterworks, and any and all real and

to read:
46-583 At the hearing, if the board of directors of such district deems it
not for the best interest of such district that a change of its boundaries be
so made as to include therein the lands mentioned in the petition, the board of
directors of such district shall order that the petition be rejected. But if
the board of directors of such district deems it for the best interest of such
district that the boundaries of such district be changed and if it appears that
the petition for the annexation and incorporation of the tract or tracts of
land has been signed and presented as provided in section 46-574, that the
allegations of the petition are true, and that no protesting petition has been
filed, or if filed has been dismissed as provided by sections 46-574 to 46-584,
the board of directors of such district may enter a tentative order annexing
and including all lands described in the petition, or some part thereof. The
order shall not become final until the proposition of levying taxes as provided
for in section 46-543 has been complied with and until the proposition of
levying taxes has been submitted by a resolution of the board of directors of
such district to the qualified electors residing within the tract or tracts of
land described in the tentative order at an election held for that purpose in
the same manner as provided for submission of incurring bonded indebtedness in
sections 46-564 to 46-566, and when the proposition has been approved by a
majority of the qualified electors residing within the tract or tracts of land
voting on the proposition at such election, then the board of directors shall
enter a final order annexing and including all lands described in the tentative
order. If at such election a majority of the qualified electors vote against
the proposition, then the board of directors of such district shall set aside
the tentative order, shall order that the petition be denied, and shall proceed
no further in that matter. If the proposition is approved by a majority of the
qualified electors of the tract or tracts voting on the proposition at such
election in the manner provided for in section 46-543, the board of directors
of such district shall certify to the county board of the county in which the
tract or tracts of land are situated the rate of tax to be levied. The final
order entered by the board of directors of such district shall describe the
entire boundaries of the district, and for that purpose the board of directors

filing written objections, specifically stating the grounds for such objection,
in the office of the natural resources district containing the land from which
the ground water is withdrawn. Upon the filing of such objections or on its own
initiative, the natural resources district shall conduct a preliminary
investigation to determine if the withdrawal, transfer, and use of ground water
is consistent with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.
Following the preliminary investigation, if the district has reason to believe
that the withdrawal, transfer, or use may not comply with any rule or
regulation of the district, it may utilize its authority under the Nebraska
Ground Water Management and Protection Act to prohibit such withdrawal,
transfer, or use. If the district has reason to believe that the withdrawal,
transfer, and use is consistent with all rules and regulations of the district
but may not comply with one or more other requirements of subsection (1) of
this section, the district shall request that the Chief Water Officer
Department of Natural Resources hold a hearing on such transfer.
(3) At the hearing, all interested persons may appear and present
testimony. Agencies or political subdivisions of this state and the appropriate
natural resources districts shall offer as evidence any information in their
possession which they deem relevant to the purposes of the hearing. After the
hearing, if the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources finds that
the withdrawal, transfer, or use of ground water is contrary to the
requirements of subsection (1) of this section, he or she shall issue a cease
and desist order prohibiting the withdrawal and transfer.
(4) The Chief Water Officer director may adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations to carry out this section.

46-703 The Legislature further finds:
(1) The management, conservation, and beneficial use of hydrologically
connected ground water and surface water are essential to the continued
economic prosperity and well-being of the state, including the present and
future development of agriculture in the state;
(2) Hydrologically connected ground water and surface water may need to be
managed differently from unconnected ground water and surface water in order to
permit equity among water users and to optimize the beneficial use of
interrelated ground water and surface water supplies;
(3) Natural resources districts already have significant legal authority
to regulate activities which contribute to declines in ground water levels and
to nonpoint source contamination of ground water and are the preferred entities
to regulate, through ground water management areas, ground water related
activities which are contributing to or are, in the reasonably foreseeable
future, likely to contribute to conflicts between ground water users and
surface water appropriators or to water supply shortages in fully appropriated
or overappropriated river basins, subbasins, or reaches;
(4) The Legislature recognizes that ground water use or surface water use
in one natural resources district may have adverse affects on water supplies in
another district or in an adjoining state. The Legislature intends and expects
that each natural resources district within which water use is causing external
impacts will accept responsibility for ground water management in accordance
with the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act in the same manner
and to the same extent as if the impacts were contained within that district;
(5) The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources is responsible
for regulation of surface water resources and local surface water project
sponsors are responsible for much of the structured irrigation utilizing
surface water supplies, and the Chief Water Officer and the local surface water
project sponsors these entities should be responsible for regulation of surface
water related activities which contribute to conflicts between ground water
users and surface water appropriators or to water supply shortages in fully
appropriated or overappropriated river basins, subbasins, or reaches;
(6) All involved natural resources districts, the Chief Water Officer
department, and surface water project sponsors should cooperate and collaborate
on the identification and implementation of management solutions to conflicts
between ground water users and surface water appropriators or to water supply
shortages in fully appropriated or overappropriated river basins, subbasins,
and reaches; and
(7) An Interrelated Water Review Board is needed to resolve any conflicts
between the Chief Water Officer department and the involved natural resources
districts concerning the content, implementation, or enforcement of integrated
management plans for fully appropriated and overappropriated river basins,
subbasins, and reaches.
Sec. 205. Section 46-704, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended

(3) Agriculture has been very productive and should continue to be an
important industry to the State of Nebraska;
(4) Natural resources districts have the legal authority to regulate
certain activities and, as local entities, are the preferred regulators of
activities which may contribute to ground water contamination in both urban and
rural areas;
(5) The department is authorized Department of Environment and Energy
should be given authority to regulate sources of contamination when necessary
to prevent serious deterioration of ground water quality;
(6) The powers given to districts and the department Department of
Environment and Energy should be used to stabilize, reduce, and prevent the
increase or spread of ground water contamination; and
(7) There is a need to provide for the orderly management of ground water
quality in areas where available data, evidence, and other information indicate
that present or potential ground water conditions require the designation of
such areas as management areas.

area or dissolution of such an area shall be in accordance with the procedures
established in this section. Hearings for such modifications or for dissolution
may not be initiated more often than once a year. Hearings for modification of
controls may be initiated as often as deemed necessary by the district, and
such modifications may be accomplished using the procedure in this section.
(5) A district shall, prior to adopting or amending any rules or
regulations for a management area, consult with any holders of permits for
intentional or incidental underground water storage and recovery issued
pursuant to section 46-226.02, 46-233, 46-240, 46-241, 46-242, or 46-297.
(6) If a ground water management area has been adopted by a district under
this section that includes one or more controls authorized by subdivision (1)
(f) or (1)(m) of section 46-739, the district may request that the Chief Water
Officer Department of Natural Resources to conduct an evaluation to determine
if an immediate stay should be placed on the issuance of new surface water
natural-flow appropriations in the area, river basin, subbasin, or reach of the
management area, and the Chief Water Officer department may determine that the
stay is in the public interest. The stay may include provisions for exceptions
to be granted for beneficial uses as described in subsection (3) of section
46-714 or for a project that provides hydrological benefit to the area of the
stay and may include provisions that the stay may be rescinded based on new or
additional information that may become available.
Sec. 212. Section 46-713, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-713 (1)(a) By January 1 of each year beginning in 2006 and except as
otherwise provided in this section and section 46-720, the Chief Water Officer
Department of Natural Resources shall complete an evaluation of the expected
long-term availability of hydrologically connected water supplies for both
existing and new surface water uses and existing and new ground water uses in
each of the state's river basins and shall issue a report that describes the
results of the evaluation. For purposes of the evaluation and the report, a
river basin may be divided into two or more subbasins or reaches. A river
basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated management plan has been or
is being developed pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-717 or pursuant to section
46-719 shall not be evaluated unless it is being reevaluated as provided in
subsection (2) of this section. For each river basin, subbasin, or reach
evaluated, the report shall describe (i) the nature and extent of use of both
surface water and ground water in each river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii)
the geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department
preliminarily considers surface water and ground water to be hydrologically
connected and the criteria used for that determination, and (iii) the extent to
which the then-current uses affect available near-term and long-term water
supplies. River basins, subbasins, and reaches designated as overappropriated
in accordance with subsection (4) of this section shall not be evaluated by the
Chief Water Officer department. The Chief Water Officer department is not
required to perform an annual evaluation for a river basin, subbasin, or reach
during the four years following a status change in such river basin, subbasin,
or reach under subsection (12) of section 46-714.
(b) Based on the information reviewed in the evaluation process, the Chief
Water Officer department shall arrive at a preliminary conclusion for each
river basin, subbasin, and reach evaluated as to whether such river basin,
subbasin, or reach presently is fully appropriated without the initiation of
additional uses. The Chief Water Officer department shall also determine if and
how such preliminary conclusion would change if no additional legal constraints
were imposed on future development of hydrologically connected surface water
and ground water and reasonable projections are made about the extent and
location of future development in such river basin, subbasin, or reach.
(c) In addition to the conclusion about whether a river basin, subbasin,
or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer department shall
include in the report, for informational purposes only, a summary of relevant
data provided by any interested party concerning the social, economic, and
environmental impacts of additional hydrologically connected surface water and
ground water uses on resources that are dependent on streamflow or ground water
levels but are not protected by appropriations or regulations.
(d) In preparing the report, the Chief Water Officer department shall rely
on the best scientific data, information, and methodologies readily available
to ensure that the conclusions and results contained in the report are
reliable. In the its report, the Chief Water Officer department shall provide
sufficient documentation to allow these data, information, methodologies, and
conclusions to be independently replicated and assessed. Upon request by the
Chief Water Officer department, state agencies, natural resources districts,
irrigation districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation
districts, mutual irrigation companies, canal companies, municipalities, and
other water users and stakeholders shall provide relevant data and information
in their possession. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources
shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other
information that will be considered for making the preliminary determinations
required by this section.
(2)(a) The Chief Water Officer department shall complete a reevaluation of
a river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated management plan has
been or is being prepared if the Chief Water Officer department has reason to
believe that a reevaluation might lead to a different determination about
whether such river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated or
overappropriated. A decision to reevaluate may be reached by the Chief Water
-76-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
Officer department on his or her its own or in response to a petition filed
with the Chief Water Officer department by any interested person. To be
considered sufficient to justify a reevaluation, a petition shall be
accompanied by supporting information showing that (i) new scientific data or
other information relevant to the determination of whether the river basin,
subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated has become
available since the last evaluation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach,
(ii) the Chief Water Officer department relied on incorrect or incomplete
information when the river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated, or
(iii) the Chief Water Officer department erred in the its interpretation or
application of the information available when the river basin, subbasin, or
reach was last evaluated. If a petition determined by the Chief Water Officer
department to be sufficient is filed before July 1 of any year, the
reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved shall be included
in the next annual report prepared in accordance with subsection (1) of this
section. If any such petition is filed on or after July 1 of any year, the
Chief Water Officer department may defer the reevaluation of the river basin,
subbasin, or reach involved until the second annual report after such filing.
(b) If the reevaluation results in a different determination by the Chief
Water Officer department, then (i) the Chief Water Officer department shall
notify, by certified mail, the affected natural resources districts and any
irrigation district, public power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation
company, canal company, or municipality that relies on water from the affected
river basin, subbasin, or reach of the preliminary change in the determination
and (ii) the Chief Water Officer department shall hold one or more public
hearings not more than ninety days after the publication of the notice required
in subdivision (b)(i) of this subsection. Notice of the hearings shall be
provided in the same manner as the notice required in subsection (1) of section
46-714. Any interested person may appear at the hearing and present written or
oral testimony and evidence concerning the appropriation status of the river
basin, subbasin, or reach.
(c) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subdivision (b) of
this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status of
the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
(3) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed fully appropriated
if the Chief Water Officer department determines based upon the its evaluation
conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and information presented
at the hearing pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 that then-current
uses of hydrologically connected surface water and ground water in the river
basin, subbasin, or reach cause or will in the reasonably foreseeable future
cause (a) the surface water supply to be insufficient to sustain over the long
term the beneficial or useful purposes for which existing natural-flow or
storage appropriations were granted and the beneficial or useful purposes for
which, at the time of approval, any existing instream appropriation was
granted, (b) the streamflow to be insufficient to sustain over the long term
the beneficial uses from wells constructed in aquifers dependent on recharge
from the river or stream involved, or (c) reduction in the flow of a river or
stream sufficient to cause noncompliance by Nebraska with an interstate compact
or decree, other formal state contract or agreement, or applicable state or
federal laws.
(4)(a) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed overappropriated
if, on July 16, 2004, the river basin, subbasin, or reach is subject to an
interstate cooperative agreement among three or more states and if, prior to
such date, the Chief Water Officer department has declared a moratorium on the
issuance of new surface water appropriations in such river basin, subbasin, or
reach and has requested each natural resources district with jurisdiction in
the affected area in such river basin, subbasin, or reach either (i) to close
or to continue in effect a previously adopted closure of all or part of such
river basin, subbasin, or reach to the issuance of additional water well
permits in accordance with subdivision (1)(k) of section 46-656.25 as such
section existed prior to July 16, 2004, or (ii) to temporarily suspend or to
continue in effect a temporary suspension, previously adopted pursuant to
section 46-656.28 as such section existed prior to July 16, 2004, on the
drilling of new water wells in all or part of such river basin, subbasin, or
reach.
(b) Within sixty days after July 16, 2004, the Chief Water Officer
department shall designate which river basins, subbasins, or reaches are
overappropriated. The designation shall include a description of the geographic
area within which the Chief Water Officer department has determined that
surface water and ground water are hydrologically connected and the criteria
used to make such determination.
Sec. 213. Section 46-714, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-714 (1) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
Resources makes a preliminary determination that a river basin, subbasin, or
reach not previously designated as overappropriated and not previously
determined to be fully appropriated has become fully appropriated, the Chief
Water Officer department shall place an immediate stay on the issuance of any
new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations in such river basin,
subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer department shall also provide
prompt notice of such preliminary determination to all licensed water well
-77-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
contractors in the state and to each natural resources district that
encompasses any of the geographic area involved. Such notice to natural
resources districts shall be by certified mail. The notice shall be addressed
to the manager of the natural resources district or his or her designee and
shall include the signature of the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural
Resources. Immediately upon receipt of such notice by the natural resources
district, there shall be a stay on issuance of water well construction permits
in the geographic area preliminarily determined by the Chief Water Officer
department to include hydrologically connected surface water and ground water
in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer department
shall also notify the public of the preliminary determination that the river
basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and of the affected geographic
area. Such notice shall be provided by publication once each week for three
consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in
such other newspaper or newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water
Officer department to provide general circulation in the river basin, subbasin,
or reach.
(2) If the Chief Water Officer department preliminarily determines a river
basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated and has identified the
existence of hydrologically connected surface water and ground water in such
river basin, subbasin, or reach, stays shall also be imposed:
(a) On the construction of any new water well in the area covered by the
determination unless a permit with conditions imposed by the natural resources
district has been issued prior to the determination. Such conditions shall meet
the objectives of subsection (4) of section 46-715 and may include, but are not
limited to, conditions in accordance with subsection (6) of section 46-739. Any
well constructed pursuant to such permit shall be completed in accordance with
section 46-738; and
(b) On the use of an existing water well or an existing surface water
appropriation in the affected area to increase the number of acres historically
irrigated.
Such additional stays shall begin ten days after the first publication, in
a newspaper of statewide circulation, of the notice of the preliminary
determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated.
(3) Exceptions to the stays imposed pursuant to subsection (1), (2), (8),
or (9) of this section shall exist for (a) test holes, (b) dewatering wells
with an intended use of one year or less, (c) monitoring wells, (d) wells
constructed pursuant to a ground water remediation plan under the Environmental
Protection Act, (e) water wells designed and constructed to pump fifty gallons
per minute or less, except that no two or more water wells that each pump fifty
gallons per minute or less may be connected or otherwise combined to serve a
single project such that the collective pumping would exceed fifty gallons per
minute, (f) water wells for range livestock, (g) new surface water uses or
water wells that are necessary to alleviate an emergency situation involving
the provision of water for human consumption or public health and safety, (h)
water wells defined by the applicable natural resources district as replacement
water wells, but the consumptive use of any such replacement water well can be
no greater than the historic consumptive use of the water well it is to replace
or, if applicable, the historic consumptive use of the surface water use it is
to replace, (i) new surface water uses and water wells to which a right or
permit is transferred in accordance with state law, but the consumptive use of
any such new use can be no greater than the historic consumptive use of the
surface water use or water well from which the right or permit is being
transferred, (j) water wells and increases in ground water irrigated acres for
which a variance is granted by the applicable natural resources district for
good cause shown, (k) subject to any conditions imposed by the applicable
natural resources district, to the extent permitted by the applicable natural
resources district, increases in ground water irrigated acres that result from
the use of water wells that were permitted prior to the effective date of the
determination made in subsection (1) of this section and completed in
accordance with section 46-738 but were not used for irrigation prior to that
effective date, (l) to the extent permitted by the applicable natural resources
district, increases in ground water irrigated acres that result from the use of
water wells that are constructed after the effective date of the stay in
accordance with a permit granted by that natural resources district prior to
the effective date of the stay, (m) surface water uses for which temporary
public-use construction permits are issued pursuant to subsection (8) of
section 46-233, (n) surface water uses and increases in surface water irrigated
acres for which a variance is granted by the Chief Water Officer department for
good cause shown, and (o) water wells for which permits have been approved by
the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the
Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act prior to the
effective date of the stay.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any stay imposed
pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall remain in effect for
the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach until the Chief Water Officer
department has made a final determination regarding whether the river basin,
subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and, if the Chief Water Officer's
department's final determination is that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is
fully appropriated, shall remain in effect as provided in subsection (11) of
this section. Within the time period between the dates of the preliminary and
final determinations, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected
natural resources districts shall consult with any irrigation district,
-78-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation
company, canal company, or municipality that relies on water from the affected
river basin, subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as
deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
resources districts. The Chief Water Officer department shall also hold one or
more public hearings not more than ninety days after the first publication of
the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. Notice of the hearings
shall be provided in the same manner as the notice required by such subsection.
Any interested person may appear at such hearing and present written or oral
testimony and evidence concerning the appropriation status of the river basin,
subbasin, or reach, the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary
conclusions about the extent of the area within which the surface water and
ground water supplies for the river basin, subbasin, or reach are determined to
be hydrologically connected, and whether the stays on new uses should be
terminated.
(5) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subsection (4) of
this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the appropriate
natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's department's final
determination with respect to the appropriation status of the river basin,
subbasin, or reach. If the final determination is that the river basin,
subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer department,
at the same time, shall (a) decide whether to continue or to terminate the
stays on new surface water uses and on increases in the number of surface water
irrigated acres and (b) designate the geographic area within which the Chief
Water Officer department considers surface water and ground water to be
hydrologically connected in the river basin, subbasin, or reach and describe
the methods and criteria used in making that determination. The Chief Water
Officer department shall provide notice of the its decision to continue or
terminate the stays in the same manner as the notice required by subsection (1)
of this section.
(6) Within ninety days after a final determination by the Chief Water
Officer department that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
appropriated, an affected natural resources district may hold one or more
public hearings on the question of whether the stays on the issuance of new
water well permits, on the construction of new water wells, or on increases in
ground water irrigated acres should be terminated. Notice of the hearings shall
be published as provided in section 46-743.
(7) Within forty-five days after a natural resources district's final
hearing pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the natural resources
district shall decide (a) whether to terminate the stay on new water wells in
all or part of the natural resources district subject to the stay and (b)
whether to terminate the stay on increases in ground water irrigated acres. If
the natural resources district decides not to terminate the stay on new water
wells in any geographic area, it shall also decide whether to exempt from such
stay the construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior to the
issuance of the stay but for which construction had not begun prior to issuance
of the stay. If construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior
to the stay is allowed, all permits that were valid when the stay went into
effect shall be extended by a time period equal to the length of the stay.
(8) Whenever the Chief Water Officer department designates a river basin,
subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, each previously declared moratorium on
the issuance of new surface water appropriations in the river basin, subbasin,
or reach shall continue in effect. The Chief Water Officer department shall
also provide prompt notice of such designation to all licensed water well
contractors in the state and to each natural resources district that
encompasses any of the geographic area involved. Immediately upon receipt of
such notice by a natural resources district, there shall be a stay on the
issuance of new water well construction permits in any portion of such natural
resources district that is within the hydrologically connected area designated
by the Chief Water Officer department. The Chief Water Officer department shall
also notify the public of the Chief Water Officer's its designation of such
river basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated and of the geographic area
involved in such designation. Such notice shall be published once each week for
three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of statewide circulation and
in such other newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
department to provide general notice in the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
(9) Beginning ten days after the first publication of notice under
subsection (8) of this section in a newspaper of statewide circulation, there
shall also be stays (a) on the construction of any new water well in the
hydrologically connected area if such construction has not commenced prior to
such date and if no permit for construction of the water well has been issued
previously by either the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
resources district, (b) on the use of an existing water well in the
hydrologically connected area to increase the number of acres historically
irrigated, and (c) on the use of an existing surface water appropriation to
increase the number of acres historically irrigated in the affected area.
(10) Within ninety days after a designation by the Chief Water Officer
department of a river basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, a natural
resources district that encompasses any of the hydrologically connected area
designated by the Chief Water Officer department may hold one or more public
hearings on the question of whether to terminate the stays on (a) the
construction of new water wells within all or part of its portion of the
hydrologically connected area, (b) the issuance of new water well construction
-79-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
permits in such area, or (c) the increase in ground water irrigated acres in
such area. Notice of any hearing for such purpose shall be provided pursuant to
section 46-743. Prior to the scheduling of a natural resources district hearing
on the question of whether to terminate any such stay, the Chief Water Officer
department and the affected natural resources district shall consult with any
irrigation district, reclamation district, public power and irrigation
district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or municipality that relies
on water from the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and with other water
users and stakeholders as deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
department or the natural resources district.
(11) Any stay issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect until
(a) the stay has been terminated pursuant to subsection (5), (7), or (10) of
this section, (b) an integrated management plan for the affected river basin,
subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Chief Water Officer department and
the affected natural resources districts and has taken effect, (c) an
integrated management plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach has
been adopted by the Interrelated Water Review Board and has taken effect, (d)
the Chief Water Officer department has completed a reevaluation pursuant to
subsection (2) of section 46-713 and has determined that the affected river
basin, subbasin, or reach is not fully appropriated or overappropriated, or (e)
the stay expires pursuant to this subsection. Such stay may be imposed
initially for not more than three years following the Chief Water Officer's
department's designation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach as
overappropriated or the Chief Water Officer's department's final determination
that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and may be
extended thereafter on an annual basis by agreement of the Chief Water Officer
department and the affected natural resources district for not more than two
additional years if necessary to allow the development, adoption, and
implementation of an integrated management plan pursuant to sections 46-715 to
46-719.
(12)(a) For purposes of this subsection, (i) a status change occurs when a
preliminary or final determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is
fully appropriated is reversed by the Chief Water Officer department or by
judicial determination and such river basin, subbasin, or reach is determined
not to be fully appropriated and (ii) the hydrologically connected area means
the geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department considers
surface water and ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach to be
hydrologically connected.
(b) If a status change occurs, any stays previously in force by the Chief
Water Officer department or affected natural resources districts shall remain
in force until the stays imposed under this subsection are in place and the
Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate stay on the issuance of
any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations in the river
basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer department shall also
provide prompt notice of the status change in accordance with subsection (1) of
this section. Immediately upon receipt of the notice by the affected natural
resources district, there shall be stays imposed as set forth in subsections
(1) and (2) of this section, subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection
(3) of this section. The stays imposed pursuant to this subsection shall remain
in effect within each affected natural resources district until such district
adopts rules and regulations in accordance with subdivision (c), (d), or (e) of
this subsection.
(c) Upon receipt of notice of a status change, each affected natural
resources district shall adopt rules and regulations within one hundred twenty
days after receipt of such notice for the prioritization and granting of water
well permits within the hydrologically connected area for the four-year period
following the status change. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
supersede the authority provided to natural resources districts under
subsection (2) of section 46-707 and subdivisions (1)(f) and (1)(m) of section
46-739.
(d) The rules and regulations adopted by each affected natural resources
district in accordance with subdivision (c) of this subsection shall (i) allow
a limited number of total new ground water irrigated acres annually, (ii) be
created with the purpose of maintaining the status of not fully appropriated
based on the most recent basin determination, (iii) be for a term of not less
than four years, and (iv) limit the number of new permits so that total new
ground water irrigated acres do not exceed the number set in the rules and
regulations. The Chief Water Officer department shall approve the proposed new
number of ground water irrigated acres within sixty days after approval by the
natural resources district if such district meets the conditions set forth in
subdivision (d)(ii) of this subsection, based on the most recent basin
determination.
(e) If the proposed new number of acres is not approved by the Chief Water
Officer department within the applicable time period as provided in subdivision
(d) of this subsection, the affected natural resources districts shall adopt
rules and regulations that allow water well permits to be issued that will
result in no more than two thousand five hundred irrigated acres or that will
result in an increase of not more than twenty percent of all historically
irrigated acres within the hydrologically connected area of each natural
resources district within the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach,
whichever is less, for each calendar year of the four-year period following the
date of the determination described in this subsection. Each affected natural
resources district may, after the initial four-year period has expired,
-80-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
annually determine whether water well permit limitations should continue and
may enforce such limitations.
(f) During the four-year period following the status change, the Chief
Water Officer department shall ensure that any new appropriation granted will
not cause the basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated based on the
most recent basin determination. The Chief Water Officer department, pursuant
to its rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under the Nebraska Ground
Water Management and Protection Act, shall not issue new natural flow surface
water appropriations for irrigation, within the river basin, subbasin, or reach
affected by the status change, that will result in a net increase of more than
eight hundred thirty-four irrigated acres in each natural resources district
during each calendar year of the four-year period following the date of the
determination described in this subsection.
Sec. 214. Section 46-715, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-715 (1)(a) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
Resources has designated a river basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated
or has made a final determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is
fully appropriated, the natural resources districts encompassing such river
basin, subbasin, or reach and the Chief Water Officer department shall jointly
develop an integrated management plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach.
The plan shall be completed, adopted, and take effect within three years after
such designation or final determination unless the Chief Water Officer
department and the natural resources districts jointly agree to an extension of
not more than two additional years.
(b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin, subbasin, or
reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or has not been finally
determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly with the Chief Water Officer
department, develop an integrated management plan for such river basin,
subbasin, or reach located within the district. The district shall notify the
Chief Water Officer department of its intention to develop an integrated
management plan which shall be developed and adopted according to sections
46-715 to 46-717 and subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-718. The objective
of an integrated management plan under this subdivision is to manage such river
basin, subbasin, or reach to achieve and sustain a balance between water uses
and water supplies for the long term. If a district develops an integrated
management plan under this subdivision and the Chief Water Officer department
subsequently determines the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach to be
fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
resources district may amend the integrated management plan.
(2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects of existing
and potential new water uses on existing surface water appropriators and ground
water users shall be considered. An integrated management plan shall include
the following: (a) Clear goals and objectives with a purpose of sustaining a
balance between water uses and water supplies so that the economic viability,
social and environmental health, safety, and welfare of the river basin,
subbasin, or reach can be achieved and maintained for both the near term and
the long term; (b) a map clearly delineating the geographic area subject to the
integrated management plan; (c) one or more of the ground water controls
authorized for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant to section
46-739; (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized for adoption
by the Chief Water Officer department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a
plan to gather and evaluate data, information, and methodologies that could be
used to implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase understanding of the
surface water and hydrologically connected ground water system, and test the
validity of the conclusions and information upon which the integrated
management plan is based. The plan may also provide for utilization of any
applicable incentive programs authorized by law. Nothing in the integrated
management plan for a fully appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach shall
require a natural resources district to regulate ground water uses in place at
the time of the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary determination
that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, unless such
regulation is necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of a basin-wide
plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a natural resources district may
voluntarily adopt such regulations. The applicable natural resources district
may decide to include all water users within the district boundary in an
integrated management plan.
(3) In order to provide a process for economic development opportunities
and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin, or reach, the
integrated management plan shall include clear and transparent procedures to
track depletions and gains to streamflows resulting from new, retired, or other
changes to uses within the river basin, subbasin, or reach. The procedures
shall:
(a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the best available
information, data, and science;
(b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized to estimate
depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes location,
amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to new uses;
(c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not have more than
a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground water users;
(d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and the Chief Water
Officer department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share information
on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting water use in the
-81-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
river basin, subbasin, or reach;
(e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available to
mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use management, and
use retirement;
(f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans after
consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts,
municipalities, other political subdivisions, and other water users to make
water available for offset to enhance and encourage economic development
opportunities and economic sustainability in the river basin, subbasin, or
reach; and
(g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses shall take to
apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.
Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment of an
integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.
(4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed for adoption in
the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
shall, when considered together and with any applicable incentive programs, (a)
be consistent with the goals and objectives of the plan, (b) be sufficient to
ensure that the state will remain in compliance with applicable state and
federal laws and with any applicable interstate water compact or decree or
other formal state contract or agreement pertaining to surface water or ground
water use or supplies, and (c) protect the ground water users whose water wells
are dependent on recharge from the river or stream involved and the surface
water appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion caused by
surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a river basin,
subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily determined
to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713, after the date of
such designation or preliminary determination.
(5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more natural
resources districts, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected
natural resources districts shall jointly develop a basin-wide plan for the
area designated as overappropriated. Such plan shall be developed using the
consultation and collaboration process described in subdivision (b) of this
subsection, shall be developed concurrently with the development of the
integrated management plan required pursuant to subsections (1) through (4) of
this section, and shall be designed to achieve, in the incremental manner
described in subdivision (d) of this subsection, the goals and objectives
described in subsection (2) of this section. The basin-wide plan shall be
adopted after hearings by the Chief Water Officer department and the affected
natural resources districts.
(b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated
and subject to this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department and each
natural resources district encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach
shall jointly develop an integrated management plan for such river basin,
subbasin, or reach pursuant to subsections (1) through (4) of this section.
Each integrated management plan for a river basin, subbasin, or reach subject
to this subsection shall be consistent with any basin-wide plan developed
pursuant to subdivision (a) of this subsection. Such integrated management plan
shall be developed after consultation and collaboration with irrigation
districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation districts, mutual
irrigation companies, canal companies, and municipalities that rely on water
from within the affected area and that, after being notified of the
commencement of the plan development process, indicate in writing their desire
to participate in such process. In addition, the Chief Water Officer department
or the affected natural resources districts may include designated
representatives of other stakeholders. If agreement is reached by all parties
involved in such consultation and collaboration process, the Chief Water
Officer department and each natural resources district shall adopt the agreed-
upon integrated management plan. If agreement cannot be reached by all parties
involved, the integrated management plan shall be developed and adopted by the
Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources district
pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board
pursuant to section 46-719.
(c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection shall
identify the overall difference between the current and fully appropriated
levels of development. Such determination shall take into account cyclical
supply, including drought, identify the portion of the overall difference
between the current and fully appropriated levels of development that is due to
conservation measures, and identify the portions of the overall difference
between the current and fully appropriated levels of development that are due
to water use initiated prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated on or
after such date.
(d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection shall
adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives identified
under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following steps:
(i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact of
streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water wells
constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to the extent
those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1, 1997, and, unless
an interstate cooperative agreement for such river basin, subbasin, or reach is
-82-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow depletions that would cause
noncompliance by Nebraska with such interstate cooperative agreement. During
the first increment, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected
natural resources districts shall also pursue voluntary efforts, subject to the
availability of funds, to offset any increase in streamflow depletive effects
that occur after July 1, 1997, but are caused by ground water uses initiated
prior to such date. The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
resources districts may also use other appropriate and authorized measures for
such purpose;
(ii) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
districts may amend an integrated management plan subject to this subsection
(5) as necessary based on an annual review of the progress being made toward
achieving the goals for that increment;
(iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated management
plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten years after the
adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated management plan pursuant
to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department
and the affected natural resources district shall conduct a technical analysis
of the actions taken in such increment to determine the progress towards
meeting the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this
section. The analysis shall include an examination of (A) available supplies
and changes in long-term availability, (B) the effects of conservation
practices and natural causes, including, but not limited to, drought, and (C)
the effects of the plan on reducing the overall difference between the current
and fully appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c)
of this section. The analysis shall determine whether a subsequent increment is
necessary in the integrated management plan to meet the goals and objectives
adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section and reduce the overall
difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of development
identified in subdivision (5)(c) of this section;
(iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii) of this
subsection, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
resources districts, utilizing the consultative and collaborative process
described in subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall if necessary identify
goals for a subsequent increment of the integrated management plan. Subsequent
increments shall be completed, adopted, and take effect not more than ten years
after adoption of the previous increment; and
(v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii) through (iv)
of this subsection shall be repeated until the Chief Water Officer department
and the affected natural resources districts agree that the goals and
objectives identified pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have been met
and the overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of this section has been addressed
so that the river basin, subbasin, or reach has returned to a fully
appropriated condition.
(6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as fully
appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure that the
state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a formal state
contract or agreement, the Chief Water Officer department, in consultation with
the affected districts, shall forecast on an annual basis the maximum amount of
water that may be available from streamflow for beneficial use in the short
term and long term in order to comply with the requirement of subdivision (4)
(b) of this section. This forecast shall be made by January 1, 2008, and each
January 1 thereafter.
Sec. 215. Section 46-716, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-716 (1) The surface water controls that may be included in an
integrated management plan and may be adopted by the Chief Water Officer
Department of Natural Resources are: (a) Increased monitoring and enforcement
of surface water diversion rates and amounts diverted annually; (b) the
prohibition or limitation of additional surface water appropriations; (c)
requirements for surface water appropriators to apply or utilize reasonable
conservation measures consistent with good husbandry and other requirements of
section 46-231 and consistent with reasonable reliance by other surface water
or ground water users on return flows or on seepage to the aquifer; and (d)
other reasonable restrictions on surface water use which are consistent with
the intent of section 46-715 and the requirements of section 46-231.
(2) If during the development of the integrated management plan the Chief
Water Officer department determines that surface water appropriators should be
required to apply or utilize conservation measures or that other reasonable
restrictions on surface water use need to be imposed, the Chief Water Officer's
department's portion of the integrated management plan shall allow the affected
surface water appropriators and surface water project sponsors a reasonable
amount of time, not to exceed one hundred eighty days unless extended by the
Chief Water Officer department, to identify the conservation measures to be
applied or utilized, to develop a schedule for such application and
utilization, and to comment on any other proposed restrictions.
Sec. 216. Section 46-717, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-717 (1) In developing an integrated management plan, the Chief Water
Officer Department of Natural Resources and the affected natural resources
districts shall utilize the best scientific data and other information
available and shall review and consider any rules and regulations in effect in
-83-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
any existing ground water management area that encompasses all or part of the
geographic area to be encompassed by the plan. Consideration shall be given to
the applicable scientific data and other information relied upon by the Chief
Water Officer department in preparing the annual report required by section
46-713 and to other types of data and information that may be deemed
appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department. The Chief Water Officer
department, after seeking input from the affected natural resources districts,
shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other
information that will be considered in developing an integrated management
plan. The natural resources districts shall adopt similar rules and regulations
specifying the types of scientific data and other information necessary for
purposes of this section. Existing research, data, studies, or any other
relevant information which has been compiled by or is in possession of other
state or federal agencies, other natural resources districts, and other
political subdivisions within the State of Nebraska shall be utilized. State
agencies and political subdivisions shall furnish information or data upon
request of the Chief Water Officer department or any affected natural resources
district. Neither the Chief Water Officer department nor the natural resources
districts shall be required to conduct new research or to develop new computer
models to prepare an integrated management plan, but such new research may be
conducted or new computer models developed within the limits of available
funding if the additional information is desired by the Chief Water Officer
department or the affected natural resources districts.
(2) During preparation of an integrated management plan for a fully
appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach or of an integrated management
plan under subdivision (1)(b) of section 46-715, the Chief Water Officer
department and the affected natural resources districts shall consult with any
irrigation district, reclamation district, public power and irrigation
district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or municipality that relies
on water from the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and with other water
users and stakeholders as deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
department or by the affected natural resources districts. They shall also
actively solicit public comments and opinions through public meetings and other
means.
Sec. 217. Section 46-718, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-718 (1) If the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources and
the affected natural resources districts preparing an integrated management
plan reach agreement on (a) the proposed goals and objectives of the plan for
the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, (b) the proposed geographic area
to be subject to controls, and (c) the surface water and ground water controls
and any incentive programs that are proposed for adoption and implementation in
the river basin, subbasin, or reach, they shall schedule one or more public
hearings to take testimony on the proposed integrated management plan and the
proposed controls. Such hearings shall be held within forty-five days after
reaching agreement and within or in reasonable proximity to the area to be
affected by implementation of the integrated management plan. Notice of such
hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743. The costs of
publishing the notice shall be shared between the Chief Water Officer
department and the affected natural resources districts. All interested persons
may appear at the hearings and present testimony or provide other evidence
relevant to the issues being considered.
(2) Within sixty days after the final hearing under this section, the
Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
shall jointly decide whether to implement the plan proposed, with or without
modifications, and whether to adopt and implement the surface water and ground
water controls and incentive programs proposed in the plan. If the Chief Water
Officer department and the natural resources districts agree to implement the
plan and to adopt and implement the proposed controls, the natural resources
districts shall by order designate a ground water management area for
integrated management or, if the geographic area subject to the integrated
management plan is already in a ground water management area, the order shall
designate an integrated management subarea for that area. The order shall
include a geographic and stratigraphic definition of the ground water
management area or integrated management subarea and shall adopt the controls
in the integrated management plan that are authorized for adoption by the
natural resources district pursuant to section 46-739. The Chief Water Officer
department shall by order adopt the controls in the integrated management plan
that are authorized for adoption by the Chief Water Officer department pursuant
to section 46-716. Neither the controls adopted by the district nor those
adopted by the Chief Water Officer department shall include controls
substantially different from those set forth in the notice of hearing. The area
designated as a ground water management area or an integrated management
subarea by the natural resources district shall not include any area that was
not identified in the notice of the hearing as within the area proposed to be
subject to the controls in the plan. The Chief Water Officer department and the
natural resources district shall each cause a copy of their respective orders
its order to be published in the manner provided in section 46-744.
(3) If at any time during the development of a basin-wide plan or an
integrated management plan either the Chief Water Officer department or the
affected natural resources districts conclude that the parties will be unable
to reach a timely agreement on the basin-wide plan or on (a) the goals and
objectives of the integrated management plan for the affected river basin,
-84-

2025 2025
subbasin, or reach, (b) the geographic area to be subject to controls, or (c)
the surface water or ground water controls or any incentive programs to be
proposed for adoption and implementation in the affected river basin, subbasin,
or reach, the Governor shall be notified and the dispute shall be submitted to
the Interrelated Water Review Board as provided in subsection (2) of section
46-719.
Sec. 218. Section 46-719, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-719 (1)(a) The Interrelated Water Review Board is created for the
purposes stated in subsections (2) through (5) of this section. The board shall
consist of five members. The board, when appointed and convened, shall continue
in existence only until it has resolved a dispute referred to it pursuant to
such subsections. The Governor shall appoint and convene the board within
forty-five days of being notified of the need to resolve a dispute. The board
shall be chaired by the Governor or his or her designee, which designee shall
be knowledgeable concerning surface water and ground water issues. The Governor
shall appoint one additional member of his or her choosing and shall appoint
the other three members of the board from a list of no fewer than six nominees
provided by the Nebraska Natural Resources Commission within twenty days after
request by the Governor for a list of nominees.
(b) Not more than two members of the board shall reside in the geographic
area involved in the dispute. A person is not eligible for membership on the
board if the decisions to be made by the board would or could cause financial
benefit or detriment to the person, a member of his or her immediate family, or
a business with which the person is associated, unless such benefit or
detriment is indistinguishable from the effects of such action on the public
generally or a broad segment of the public. The board shall be subject to the
Open Meetings Act.
(c) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, action may be
taken by a vote of three of the board's five members. For purposes of
subsections (4) and (5) of this section, action may be taken only by a vote of
at least four of the board's five members.
(2)(a) If the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources and the
affected natural resources districts cannot resolve disputes over the content
of a basin-wide plan or an integrated management plan by utilizing the process
described in sections 46-715 to 46-718, the Governor shall be notified and the
dispute submitted to the Interrelated Water Review Board. When the board has
been appointed and convened to resolve disputes over a basin-wide plan, the
Chief Water Officer department and each affected district shall present their
proposed basin-wide plans to the board. When the board has been convened to
resolve disputes over an integrated management plan, the Chief Water Officer
department and each affected natural resources district shall present their (i)
proposed goals and objectives for the integrated management plan, (ii) proposed
geographic area to be subject to controls, and (iii) proposed surface water and
ground water controls and any proposed incentive program for adoption and
implementation in the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved. The Chief Water
Officer department and each affected natural resources district shall also be
given adequate opportunity to comment on the proposals made by the other
parties to the dispute.
(b) When the Interrelated Water Review Board concludes that the issues in
dispute have been fully presented and commented upon by the parties to the
dispute, which conclusion shall be made not more than forty-five days after the
board is convened, the board shall select the proposals or portions of
proposals that the board will consider for adoption and shall schedule one or
more public hearings to take testimony on the selected proposals. The hearings
shall be held within forty-five days after the board's selection of proposals
to consider for adoption and shall be within or in reasonable proximity to the
area that would be affected by implementation of any of the proposals to be
considered at the hearings. Notice of the hearings shall be published as
provided in section 46-743. The cost of publishing the notice shall be shared
by the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
districts. All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present
testimony or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being considered.
(c) Within forty-five days after the final hearing pursuant to subdivision
(b) of this subsection, the Interrelated Water Review Board shall by order, as
applicable, adopt a basin-wide plan or an integrated management plan for the
affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and, in the case of an integrated
management plan, shall designate a ground water management area for integrated
management or an integrated management subarea for such river basin, subbasin,
or reach. An integrated management plan shall be consistent with subsection (2)
of section 46-715, and the surface water and ground water controls and any
applicable incentive programs adopted as part of that plan shall be consistent
with subsection (4) of section 46-715. The controls adopted by the board shall
not be substantially different from those described in the notice of hearing.
The area designated as a ground water management area or an integrated
management subarea shall not include any area that was not identified in the
notice of the hearing as within the area proposed to be subject to the controls
in the plan.
(d) The order adopted under this subsection shall be published in the
manner prescribed in section 46-744.
(e) Surface water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review Board
shall be implemented and enforced by the Chief Water Officer department. Ground
water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
-85-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
implemented and enforced by the affected natural resources districts.
(3) Whether an integrated management plan is adopted pursuant to section
46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board pursuant to subsection (2) of
this section, the Chief Water Officer department or a natural resources
district responsible in part for implementation and enforcement of an
integrated management plan may propose modification of the goals or objectives
of that plan, of the area subject to the plan, or of the surface water
controls, ground water controls, or incentive programs adopted to implement the
plan. The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
districts shall utilize the procedures in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an
attempt to reach agreement on and to adopt and implement proposed
modifications. If agreement on such modifications cannot be achieved utilizing
those procedures, either the Chief Water Officer department or an affected
natural resources district may notify the Governor of the dispute. The
Interrelated Water Review Board shall be appointed and convened in accordance
with subsection (1) of this section to resolve the dispute and, if applicable,
to adopt any modifications utilizing the procedures in subsection (2) of this
section.
(4) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
districts may also raise objections concerning the implementation or
enforcement of previously adopted surface water or ground water controls. The
Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
shall utilize the procedures in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to
reach agreement on such implementation or enforcement issues. If agreement on
such issues cannot be achieved utilizing such procedures, either the Chief
Water Officer department or an affected natural resources district may notify
the Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
appointed and convened in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. After
permitting each party to fully express the its reasons for the its position
taken by each party on the disputed issues, the board may either take no action
or conclude (a) that one or more parties needs to modify the party's its
approach to implementation or enforcement and direct that such modifications
take place or (b) that one or more parties either has not made a good faith
effort to implement or enforce the portion of the plan or controls for which
the party it is responsible or is unable to fully implement and enforce such
portion and that such party's jurisdiction with respect to implementation and
enforcement of the plan and controls shall be terminated and reassigned to one
or more of the other parties responsible for implementation and enforcement. A
decision by the Interrelated Water Review Board to terminate and reassign
jurisdiction of any portion of the plan or controls shall take effect
immediately upon that decision. Notice of such reassignment shall be published
at least once in one or more newspapers as necessary to provide general
circulation in the area affected by such reassignment.
(5) The board may be reconvened in accordance with subsection (1) of this
section at a later date upon request to the Governor by the party for which
jurisdiction for implementation and enforcement was terminated if such party
desires to have the party's its jurisdiction reinstated, but no such request
shall be honored until at least one year after the termination and not more
than once per year thereafter. The board may reinstate jurisdiction to that
party only upon a clear showing by such party that the party it is willing and
able to fully implement and enforce the plan and any applicable controls.
Notice that a party's jurisdiction has been reinstated shall be provided in the
same manner that notice of the earlier termination was given.
Sec. 219. Section 46-720, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-720 (1) The Legislature finds that, prior to July 16, 2004, actions
were taken by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed prior to July
1, 2025, and by one or more natural resources districts pursuant to section
46-656.28, as such section existed immediately prior to July 16, 2004 such
date, for the purpose of addressing circumstances that are, after July 16, 2004
such date, to be addressed in accordance with sections 46-713 to 46-719. It is
the intent of the Legislature that actions taken pursuant to section 46-656.28,
as such section existed immediately prior to July 16, 2004, should not be
negated and that transition from the authorities and responsibilities granted
by such section to those granted by sections 46-713 to 46-719 should occur in
as efficient a manner as possible. Such transition shall be therefor governed
by subsections (2) through (5) of this section, and all references in such
subsections to section 46-656.28 shall be construed to mean section 46-656.28
as such section existed immediately prior to July 16, 2004.
(2) If, prior to July 16, 2004, (a) a natural resources district requested
pursuant to subsection (1) of section 46-656.28 that affected appropriators,
affected surface water project sponsors, and the department consult and that
studies and a hearing be held but (b) the Director of Natural Resources, as
such position existed, had has not made a preliminary determination relative to
that request pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28, no further action
on the district's request shall be required of the department. If under the
same circumstances a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain water
wells has been imposed by the district pursuant to subsection (16) of section
46-656.28 and remains in effect immediately prior to July 16, 2004, such
temporary suspension shall remain in effect for thirty days after the
department issues its first annual report under section 46-713, except that (i)
such temporary suspension shall not apply to water wells for which a permit has
been obtained pursuant to the Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water
-86-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
Transfers Permit Act and (ii) to the extent any such temporary suspension is in
effect for all or part of a hydrologically connected area for a river basin,
subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated by the department, such
temporary suspension shall remain in effect only until it is superseded by the
stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section 46-714. To the
extent that any such temporary suspension applies to a geographic area
preliminarily considered by the department to have ground water hydrologically
connected to the surface water of a fully appropriated river basin, subbasin,
or reach, such temporary suspension shall be superseded by the stays imposed
pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714.
(3)(a) If prior to July 16, 2004, (i) the director has made a preliminary
determination pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28 that there is
reason to believe that the use of hydrologically connected ground water and
surface water in a specific geographic area is contributing to or is in the
reasonably foreseeable future likely to contribute to any conflict, dispute, or
difficulty listed in such subsection, (ii) the director has not made a
determination pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint
action plan should not be prepared, and (iii) preparation of a joint action
plan pursuant to subsections (5) through (9) of such section has not been
completed, the geographic area involved shall become subject to sections 46-713
to 46-719 on July 16, 2004, and the department need not evaluate such
geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section 46-713.
(b) For purposes of this subsection and section 46-714 and except as
otherwise provided in this section, (i) July 16, 2004, shall result in the
imposition in any geographic area subject to this subsection of the stays
required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714, (ii) such stays shall be
imposed in the manner required by such section, and (iii) July 16, 2004, shall
be treated as if it were the date of a departmental preliminary determination
pursuant to section 46-713 that such area is a geographic area within which
ground water and surface water of a fully appropriated river basin, subbasin,
or reach are hydrologically connected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this subsection, if a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain new water
wells has previously been imposed by the affected natural resources district,
(A) the stays on construction of new water wells and on the increase in ground
water irrigated acres shall be limited in geographic extent to only that part
of the affected area within which the temporary suspension was in effect unless
the director determines that inclusion of additional area is necessary because
ground water and surface water are hydrologically connected in such additional
area and (B) the stays on construction of certain new water wells shall not
apply to a water well constructed in accordance with the terms of a water well
construction permit approved by the district prior to July 16, 2004, unless
such well was subject to the district's temporary suspension. If, prior to July
16, 2004, the director has held a hearing on a report issued pursuant to
subsection (3) of section 46-656.28 but has not yet determined whether a joint
action plan should be prepared, no departmental hearing shall be required
pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 before a final determination is
made about whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved is fully
appropriated. If, prior to July 16, 2004, the director has determined pursuant
to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint action plan should be
prepared, such determination shall have the same effect as a final departmental
determination pursuant to subsection (5) of section 46-714 that the affected
river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and no separate
determination to that effect shall be required. If, after July 16, 2004, the
department determines that all or part of the area subject to this subsection
is in an overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach, that portion of the
area shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Ground Water
Management and Protection Act applicable to an overappropriated river basin,
subbasin, or reach and stays that have previously taken effect in accordance
with this subsection shall continue in effect as stays for an overappropriated
river basin, subbasin, or reach without additional action or publication of
notice by the department. Any temporary suspension in the drilling of certain
water wells that has been imposed in the geographic area involved by a natural
resources district pursuant to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28 prior to
July 16, 2004, shall remain in effect until superseded by the stays imposed
pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714.
(4) If, prior to July 16, 2004, preparation of a joint action plan has
been completed pursuant to subsections (5) through (9) of section 46-656.28 but
the plan has not yet been adopted pursuant to subsection (11) of such section,
the department need not evaluate the affected geographic area in its first
annual report issued pursuant to section 46-713. The department and the
affected natural resources district shall review the completed joint action
plan for its compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717. If the joint action
plan is determined to be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 or if
agreement is reached on the revisions necessary to bring it into such
compliance, the department and the district shall adopt the plan and implement
the controls as provided in section 46-718. If the joint action plan is
determined not to be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 and agreement
on the proposed plan or the proposed controls cannot be reached pursuant to
section 46-718, section 46-719 shall apply. Except to the extent that any
portion of the affected area is designated as all or part of an
overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach, any temporary suspension in
the drilling of certain water wells imposed in the affected geographic area by
a natural resources district pursuant to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28
-87-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
shall remain in effect until (a) the department and the affected district have
jointly decided to implement the plan, with or without modifications, and
controls have been adopted and taken effect or (b) the Interrelated Water
Review Board, pursuant to section 46-719, has adopted an integrated management
plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and the controls adopted
by the board have taken effect. To the extent that any portion of the affected
area is designated as all or part of an overappropriated river basin, subbasin,
or reach, any temporary suspension in the drilling of water wells shall be
superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section
46-714.
(5) If, before July 16, 2004, a joint action plan has been adopted and
implemented pursuant to subsections (10) through (12) of section 46-656.28 and
is in effect immediately prior to such date, the department need not evaluate
the geographic area subject to the plan in the department's first annual report
issued pursuant to section 46-713. For purposes of the Nebraska Ground Water
Management and Protection Act, (a) the plan adopted shall be considered an
integrated management plan adopted pursuant to section 46-718, (b) the
management area designated shall be considered an integrated management area or
subarea designated pursuant to section 46-718, and (c) the controls adopted
shall be considered controls adopted pursuant to section 46-718 and shall
remain in effect until amended or repealed pursuant to section 46-718 or
46-719.
Sec. 220. Section 46-721, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-721 Each state agency and political subdivision shall promptly report
to the department Department of Environment and Energy any information which
indicates that contamination is occurring.
Sec. 221. Section 46-722, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-722 If, as a result of information provided pursuant to section 46-721
or studies conducted by or otherwise available to the department Department of
Environment and Energy and following preliminary investigation, the Director of
Water, Energy, and Environment Director of Environment and Energy makes a
preliminary determination (1) that there is reason to believe that
contamination of ground water is occurring or likely to occur in an area of the
state in the reasonably foreseeable future and (2) that the natural resources
district or districts in which the area is located have not designated a
management area or have not implemented adequate controls to prevent such
contamination from occurring, the department shall, in cooperation with any
appropriate state agency and district, conduct a study to determine the source
or sources of the contamination and the area affected by such contamination and
shall issue a written report within one year of the initiation of the study.
During the study, the department shall consider the relevant water quality
portions of the management plan developed by each district pursuant to sections
46-709 to 46-711, whether the district has designated a management area
encompassing the area studied, and whether the district has adopted any
controls for the area.
Sec. 222. Section 46-723, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-723 If the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of
Environment and Energy determines from the study conducted pursuant to section
46-722 that one or more sources of contamination are point sources, he or she
shall expeditiously use the procedures authorized in the Environmental
Protection Act to stabilize or reduce the level and prevent the increase or
spread of such contamination.
Sec. 223. Section 46-724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-724 If the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of
Environment and Energy determines from the study conducted pursuant to section
46-722 that one or more sources of contamination are not point sources and if a
management area, a purpose of which is protection of water quality, has been
established which includes the affected area, the director Director of
Environment and Energy shall consider whether to require the district which
established the management area to adopt an action plan as provided in sections
46-725 to 46-729.
If the director Director of Environment and Energy determines that one or
more of the sources are not point sources and if such a management area has not
been established or does not include all the affected area, he or she shall,
within thirty days after completion of the report required by section 46-722,
consult with the district within whose boundaries the area affected by such
contamination is located and fix a time and place for a public hearing to
consider the report, hear any other evidence, and secure testimony on whether a
management area should be designated or whether an existing area should be
modified. The hearing shall be held within one hundred twenty days after
completion of the report. Notice of the hearing shall be given as provided in
section 46-743, and the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with such
section.
At the hearing, all interested persons shall be allowed to appear and
present testimony. The Conservation and Survey Division of the University of
Nebraska, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of
Natural Resources, and the appropriate district may offer as evidence any
information in their possession which they deem relevant to the purpose of the
hearing. After the hearing and after any studies or investigations conducted by
-88-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
or on behalf of the director Director of Environment and Energy as he or she
deems necessary, the director shall determine whether a management area shall
be designated.
Sec. 224. Section 46-725, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-725 (1) When determining whether to designate or modify the boundaries
of a management area or to require a district which has established a
management area, a purpose of which is protection of water quality, to adopt an
action plan for the affected area, the Director of Water, Energy, and
Environment Director of Environment and Energy shall consider:
(a) Whether contamination of ground water has occurred or is likely to
occur in the reasonably foreseeable future;
(b) Whether ground water users, including, but not limited to, domestic,
municipal, industrial, and agricultural users, are experiencing or will
experience within the foreseeable future substantial economic hardships as a
direct result of current or reasonably anticipated activities which cause or
contribute to contamination of ground water;

(l) It may require, when conditions so permit, that new or replacement
water wells to be used for domestic or other purposes shall be constructed to
such a depth that they are less likely to be affected by seasonal water level
declines caused by other water wells in the same area;
(m) It may close all or a portion of the management area to the issuance
of additional permits or may condition the issuance of additional permits on
compliance with other rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the
district to achieve the purpose or purposes for which the management area was
designated; and
(n) It may adopt and promulgate such other reasonable rules and
regulations as are necessary to carry out the purpose for which a management
area was designated.
(2) In adopting, amending, or repealing any control authorized by
subsection (1) of this section or sections 46-740 and 46-741, the district's
considerations shall include, but not be limited to, whether it reasonably
appears that such action will mitigate or eliminate the condition which led to
designation of the management area or will improve the administration of the
area.

(4) If because of varying ground water uses, varying surface water uses,
different irrigation distribution systems, or varying climatic, hydrologic,
geologic, or soil conditions existing within a management area the uniform
application throughout such area of one or more controls would fail to carry
out the intent of the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act in a
reasonably effective and equitable manner, the controls adopted by the district
pursuant to this section may contain different provisions for different
categories of ground water use or portions of the management area which differ
from each other because of varying climatic, hydrologic, geologic, or soil
conditions. Any differences in such provisions shall recognize and be directed
toward such varying ground water uses or varying conditions. Except as
otherwise provided in this section, if the district adopts different controls
for different categories of ground water use, those controls shall be
consistent with section 46-613 and shall, for each such category, be uniform
for all portions of the area which have substantially similar climatic,
hydrologic, geologic, and soil conditions.
(5) The district may establish different water allocations for different
irrigation distribution systems.
(6)(a) The district may establish different provisions for different
hydrologic relationships between ground water and surface water.
(b) For management areas a purpose of which is the integrated management
of hydrologically connected ground water and surface water, the district may
establish different provisions for water wells either permitted or constructed
before the designation of a management area for integrated management of
hydrologically connected ground water and surface water and for water wells
either permitted or constructed on or after the designation date or any other
later date or dates established by the district. Permits for construction of
new wells not completed by the date of the determination of fully appropriated
shall be subject to any conditions imposed by the applicable natural resources
district.
(c) For a management area in a river basin or part of a river basin that
is or was the subject of litigation over an interstate water compact or decree
in which the State of Nebraska is a named defendant, the district may establish
different provisions for restriction of water wells constructed after January
1, 2001, if such litigation was commenced before or on May 22, 2001. If such
litigation is commenced after May 22, 2001, the district may establish
different provisions for restriction of water wells constructed after the date
on which such litigation is commenced in federal court. An appeal from a
decision of the district under this subdivision shall be in accordance with the
hearing procedures established in the Nebraska Ground Water Management and
Protection Act.
(d) Except as otherwise authorized by law, the district shall make a
replacement water well as defined in section 46-602, or as further defined in
district rules and regulations, subject to the same provisions as the water
well it replaces.
(7) If the district has included controls delineated in subdivision (1)(m)
of this section in its management plan, but has not implemented such controls
within two years after the initial public hearing on the controls, the district
shall hold a public hearing, as provided in section 46-712, regarding the
controls before implementing them.
(8) In addition to the controls listed in subsection (1) of this section,
a district in which a management area has been designated may also adopt and
implement one or more of the following measures if it determines that any such
measures would help the district and water users achieve the goals and
objectives of the management area: (a) It may sponsor nonmandatory educational
programs; and (b) it may establish and implement financial or other incentive
programs. As a condition for participation in an incentive program, the
district may require water users or landowners to enter into and perform such
agreements or covenants concerning the use of land or water as are necessary to
produce the benefits for which the incentive program is established and shall
further condition participation upon satisfaction of the requirements of
section 46-739.01.
Sec. 235. Section 46-740, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
46-740 (1) If allocation is adopted for use of ground water for irrigation
purposes in a management area, the permissible withdrawal of ground water shall
be allocated equally per irrigated acre except as permitted by subsections (4)
through (6) of section 46-739. Such allocation shall specify the total number
of acre-inches that are allocated per irrigated acre per year, except that the
district may allow a ground water user to average his or her allocation over
any reasonable period of time. A ground water user may use his or her
allocation on all or any part of the irrigated acres to which the allocation
applies or in any other manner approved by the district.
(2) Except as permitted pursuant to subsections (4) through (6) of section
46-739, if annual rotation or reduction of irrigated acres is adopted for use
of ground water for irrigation purposes in a management area, the nonuse of
irrigated acres shall be a uniform percentage reduction of each landowner's
irrigated acres within the management area or a subarea of the management area.
Such uniform reduction may be adjusted for each landowner based upon crops
grown on his or her land to reflect the varying consumptive requirements
between crops.
(3) Unless an integrated management plan, a rule, or an order is
established, adopted, or issued prior to November 1, 2005, no integrated
-92-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
management plan, rule, or order shall limit the use of ground water by a
municipality, within an area determined by the Chief Water Officer Department
of Natural Resources to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 or
designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713, until January 1,
2026, except that:
(a) Any allocations to a municipality that have been made as of November
1, 2005, shall remain in full force and effect unless changed by the
appropriate natural resources district;
(b)(i) For any municipality that has not received an allocation as of
November 1, 2005, the minimum annual allocation may be the greater of either
the amount of ground water authorized by a permit issued pursuant to the
Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act or the
governmental, commercial, and industrial uses of the municipality plus a per
capita allowance. Water for commercial and industrial uses may be limited as
specified in subdivision (b)(iii) of this subsection.
(ii) The per capita allowance shall be based on the location of the
municipality, increasing in equal increments from east to west, and shall not
be less than two hundred gallons per person per day at 95 degrees, 19 minutes,
00 seconds longitude and not less than two hundred fifty gallons per person per
day at 104 degrees, 04 minutes, 00 seconds longitude. Persons served by a
municipality outside of its corporate limits shall be considered part of the
municipality's population if such service begins prior to January 1, 2026.

single industrial development served by any municipality within the fully
appropriated or overappropriated area which, after July 14, 2006, commences
water use resulting in the consumptive use of water in amounts greater than
twenty-five million gallons annually may be subject to controls adopted
pursuant to section 46-715;
(c) Prior to January 1, 2026, increases in the consumptive use of water by
a municipality that result in a decrease in streamflow shall be addressed by
the integrated management plan pursuant to controls or incentive programs
adopted pursuant to section 46-715 and shall not affect the municipal
allocations outlined in subdivisions (3)(a) and (b) of this section. Any
permanent reduction in consumptive use of water associated with municipal
growth, including governmental, industrial, and commercial growth, during the
period between July 14, 2006, and January 1, 2026, shall accrue to the benefit
of the natural resources district within which such municipality is located;
and
(d) To qualify for the exemption specified in subsection (3) of this
section, any city of the metropolitan class, city of the primary class, city of
the first class, or city of the second class shall file a conservation plan
with the natural resources district, if required by the integrated management
plan. Villages and other municipalities smaller than a city of the second class
shall not be required to submit a conservation plan to qualify for such
exemption.
(4) On and after January 1, 2026, the base amount for an annual allocation
to a municipality shall be determined as the greater of either (a) the amount
of water authorized by a permit issued pursuant to the Municipal and Rural
Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act or (b) the greatest annual use prior
to January 1, 2026, for uses specified in subdivision (3)(b) of this section
plus the per capita allowance described in subdivision (3)(b)(ii) of this
section. On and after January 1, 2026, increases in the consumptive use of
water by a municipality that result in a decrease in streamflow shall be
addressed by the integrated management plan pursuant to controls or incentive
programs adopted pursuant to section 46-715. Each municipality may be subject
to controls adopted pursuant to such section for amounts in excess of the
allocations.
(5) Unless an integrated management plan, rule, or order is established,
adopted, or issued prior to November 1, 2005, no integrated management plan,
rule, or order shall limit the use of ground water by a nonmunicipal commercial
or industrial water user within an area determined by the Department of Natural
Resources as it existed prior to July 1, 2025, or the Chief Water Officer
department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 or designated as
overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713, until January 1, 2026, except
that:
(a) Prior to January 1, 2026, the minimum annual allocation for a
nonmunicipal commercial or industrial user shall be the greater of either (i)
the amount specified in a permit issued pursuant to the Industrial Ground Water
Regulatory Act or (ii) the amount necessary to achieve the commercial or
industrial use, including all new or expanded uses that consume less than
twenty-five million gallons annually. Any increases in the consumptive use of
water by a nonmunicipal commercial or industrial water user that result in a
decrease in streamflow shall be addressed by the integrated management plan
pursuant to controls or incentive programs adopted pursuant to section 46-715;
(b) Prior to January 1, 2026, any new or expanded single commercial or
industrial development served by a nonmunicipal well within an area determined
by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed prior to July 1, 2025, or
the Chief Water Officer department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section
46-714 or designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 which,
after July 14, 2006, commences water use resulting in the consumptive use of
water in amounts greater than twenty-five million gallons annually may be

department Department of Environment and Energy, with the concurrence of the
Department of Natural Resources, may require the applicant to obtain approval
from the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources for any dam,
holding pond, or lagoon structure which would not otherwise require approval
under the Safety of Dams and Reservoirs Act but which in the event of a failure
could result in a significant discharge into waters of the state and have a
significant impact on the environment. The Department of Environment and Energy
may provide for the payment of such costs of the Department of Natural
Resources with revenue generated under section 54-2428.

Architects Regulation Act.
(3) An applicant who has a large concentrated animal feeding operation, as
defined in 40 C.F.R. 122 and 123, as such regulations existed on January 1,
2004, and who is required to obtain a construction and operating permit is
subject to the requirements of the Engineers and Architects Regulation Act.
(4) An applicant who has a small or medium animal feeding operation, as
defined in 40 C.F.R. 122 and 123, as such regulations existed on January 1,
2004, and who is required to obtain a construction and operating permit, but
not required to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit, is exempt from the Engineers and Architects Regulation Act.
(5) The department may require an engineering evaluation or assessment
performed by a licensed professional engineer for a livestock waste control
facility if after an inspection: (a) The department determines that the
facility has (i) visible signs of structural breakage below the permanent pool,
(ii) signs of discharge or proven discharge due to structural weakness, (iii)
improper maintenance, or (iv) inadequate capacity; or (b) the department has
reason to believe that an animal feeding operation with a livestock waste
control facility has violated or threatens to violate the Environmental
Protection Act, the Livestock Waste Management Act, or any rules or regulations
adopted and promulgated under such acts. Animal feeding operations not required
to have a permit under the Environmental Protection Act, the Livestock Waste
Management Act, or the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant
to such acts are exempt from the Engineers and Architects Regulation Act.
Sec. 314. Section 54-2430, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
54-2430 (1) Except as provided in this section, no new livestock waste
control facility shall be constructed and no physical onsite activities
specific to a new livestock waste control facility, except the use of a borrow
site for construction of other components of the animal feeding operation,
shall be initiated unless surface water runoff from the upstream area, except
incidental runoff, is adequately diverted around the structure and is not
permitted to enter the reservoir area. For purposes of this section, incidental
runoff means the runoff that drains from the slope of the embankments, the top
of the dam, the reservoir area, the feedlots, the associated roadways, and up
to twenty-five acres of additional area that cannot be diverted. Incidental
runoff capacity from a twenty-five-year frequency, twenty-four-hour storm shall
be provided for in the waste reservoir in addition to the capacity required for
the waste effluent or stored materials.
(2) The department Department of Natural Resources shall permit a
requested increase in the twenty-five-acre limitation for a new livestock waste
control facility for an animal feeding operation for which an inspection was
requested prior to January 1, 2000, unless the department determines that the
detriment to existing water users that would result from permitting the acreage
increase would outweigh the detriment to the operator of the animal feeding
operation if the increase were not permitted.
(3) For other new livestock waste control facilities, the department
Department of Natural Resources may permit an increase in the twenty-five-acre
limitation if it determines that (a) the applicant has no reasonable way to
limit the amount of the additional runoff acreage to twenty-five acres or less
at the proposed location of the livestock waste control facility, (b) the
applicant has no reasonable alternative for relocating the livestock waste
control facility so that the additional runoff acreage would not exceed twenty-
five acres, and (c) either (i) an increase in the permitted runoff acreage
would not reduce water supplies to the detriment of existing water users or
(ii)(A) the requested facility is for a proposed expansion of an animal feeding
operation in existence and in compliance with the Livestock Waste Management
Act as of January 1, 2003, (B) the amount of the runoff acreage permitted in
excess of the twenty-five-acre limitation is not more than fifteen percent of
total permitted feedlot area, and (C) any detriment to existing water users
that would result from permitting the acreage increase would be outweighed by
the detriment to the operator of the animal feeding operation if the increase
were not permitted.
Sec. 315. Section 54-2940, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
54-2940 In carrying out its duties to prevent, suppress, control, and

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
approved if the proposed route of the major oil pipeline is determined by the
Public Service Commission to be in the public interest. The pipeline carrier
shall have the burden to establish that the proposed route of the major oil
pipeline would serve the public interest. In determining whether the pipeline
carrier has met its burden, the commission shall not evaluate safety
considerations, including the risk or impact of spills or leaks from the major
oil pipeline, but the commission shall evaluate:
(a) Whether the pipeline carrier has demonstrated compliance with all
applicable state statutes, rules, and regulations and local ordinances;
(b) Evidence of the impact due to intrusion upon natural resources and not
due to safety of the proposed route of the major oil pipeline to the natural

include in-field and gathering lines; and
(3) Pipeline carrier means an individual, a company, a corporation, an
association, or any other legal entity that engages in owning, operating, or
managing an oil pipeline.
Sec. 318. Section 57-1609, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
57-1609 Before issuing a permit, the commission shall consult with the
Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy and the
Underground Injection Control program permitting authority.
Sec. 319. Section 57-1614, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
57-1614 (1) The commission shall take action to ensure that a storage
facility does not cause pollution or create a nuisance. For the purposes of
this provision and in applying other laws, carbon dioxide streams stored, and
which remain in storage under a commission permit, are not a pollutant and do
not constitute a nuisance.
(2) The commission's authority in subsection (1) of this section does not
limit the jurisdiction held by the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
Environment and Energy. Nothing else in the Nebraska Geologic Storage of Carbon
Dioxide Act limits the jurisdiction held by the Department of Water, Energy,
and Environment Environment and Energy.
(3) The commission shall take action to ensure that substances that
compromise the objectives of the act or the integrity of a storage reservoir do
not enter a storage reservoir.
(4) The commission shall take action to ensure that carbon dioxide does
not escape from a storage facility.
Sec. 320. Section 57-1619, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
amended to read:
57-1619 (1) After carbon dioxide injections into a reservoir end and upon
application by the storage operator, the commission shall consider issuing a
certificate of project completion.
(2) The certificate may only be issued after public notice and hearing.
The commission shall establish notice requirements for such hearing.

with the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy
and the Underground Injection Control program permitting authority.
(4) The certificate may only be issued if the storage operator:
(a) Is in full compliance with all laws governing the storage facility;
(b) Shows that it has addressed all pending claims regarding the storage
facility's operation;
(c) Shows that it has received an authorization of site closure from the
applicable underground injection control program permitting authority for each
storage facility injection well; and
(d) Shows that any wells, equipment, and facilities to be used in the
post-closure period are in good condition and retain mechanical integrity.
(5) Once a certificate is issued:
(a) Title to the storage facility and to the stored carbon dioxide
transfers, without payment of any compensation, to the State of Nebraska;
-116-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
(b) Title acquired by the state includes all rights and interests in, and
all responsibilities associated with, the stored carbon dioxide;
(c) The storage operator and all persons who generated any injected carbon
dioxide streams are released from all regulatory requirements associated with
the storage facility;
(d) Any financial assurance provided by the storage operator shall be
released; and
(e) Monitoring and managing the storage facility is the state's
responsibility to be overseen by the commission.
Sec. 321. Section 58-202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
58-202 (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The high cost of agricultural loans and the general unavailability of
such loans at favorable rates and terms for farmers, particularly beginning
farmers, and other agricultural enterprises have resulted in decreased crop,
livestock, and business productivity and prevented farmers and other
agricultural enterprises from acquiring modern agricultural equipment and
processes. These problems have made it difficult for farmers and other
agricultural enterprises to maintain or increase their present number of
employees and have decreased the supply of agricultural commodities available
to fulfill the needs of the citizens of this state; and
(b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a pressing need
for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest rates and terms
which are consistent with the needs of farmers, particularly beginning farmers,
and other agricultural enterprises.
(2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing starts
and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts causes a
condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the construction
industry;
(b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the creation of
slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this state and a
deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this state and
necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for
crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident
prevention, and other public services and facilities; and
(c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an inadequate
supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and uncrowded housing at
prices at which low-income and moderate-income persons, particularly first-time
homebuyers, can afford to purchase, construct, or rent and as a result such
persons are forced to occupy unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
(3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of life
and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate food and
shelter;
(b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
(c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy supplies for
purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of many of Nebraska's
citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and will result in a
deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the health and welfare of
the citizens of this state;
(d) Energy conservation through building modifications including, but not
limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of alternative
energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of reducing energy
consumption costs and the need for additional costly facilities to produce and
supply energy;
(e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of energy
conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The prohibitively
high interest rates for private capital create a situation in which the
necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private enterprise sources and
there is a need for the stimulation of investment of private capital, thereby
encouraging the purchase of energy conservation devices and energy conserving
building modifications;
(f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-sustaining
energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and private,
available for providing other necessities of life, including food, health care,
and safe, sanitary housing; and
(g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the transfer of
ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy suppliers.
(4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic decline and
need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly increasing public
expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare, decreasing the tax
base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic and social liabilities to
the entire state;
(b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state to
deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions result in
making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the economic and
social well-being of the entire state and the communities in which they exist,
needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing onerous state and municipal
-117-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, substantially impairing
or arresting the sound growth of the state and the municipalities, depreciating
general state and community-wide values, and contributing to the spread of
disease and crime which necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures
of public funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
(c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages which
require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate hospital and
nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since these conditions
cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private enterprises and since
provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and medical care is a public use, it
is in the public interest that adequate hospital and medical facilities and
care be provided in order to care for and protect the public health and
welfare;
(d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless public
expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals and health care
and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are needed within this
state; and
(e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state policy,
public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and authority
inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state and its
municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which consume an
excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the economic base of the
state may be broadened and stabilized thereby providing jobs and necessary tax
base, and in order that adequate health care services be provided to all
residents of this state.
(5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal funding
provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited while the
need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
water facilities is great;
(b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement of
modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities are
essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the provision
of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities
is essential to economic growth and development, and new sources of financing
for such projects are needed;
(c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking water
facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create appropriate
funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or expected to be
required to provide matching funds for deposit into such funds or accounts, and
there is a need for financing in excess of the amount which can be provided by
the federal money and the state match; and
(d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as defined in
section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution or the provision
of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of revenue bonds, the
proceeds of which shall be deposited into the Wastewater Treatment Facilities
Construction Loan Fund or the comparable state fund to finance safe drinking
water facilities. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the provision of
loans , including loans made pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act, to a
municipality as defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction, development,
rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of wastewater treatment
facilities or safe drinking water facilities.
(6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-profit
schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be hazardous to
the health and well-being of the residents of the state and the reduction or
elimination of accessibility barriers and that the federal funding provided for
such projects is extremely limited and the need and requirement to remove such
materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers from school
buildings is great;
(b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and the
reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to protecting
and improving the facilities in the state which provide educational benefits
and services;
(c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such hazardous
materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers; and
(d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied through
the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or both but may
be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to encourage the
investment of private capital and assist in the financing of the removal of
-118-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination of accessibility
barriers in educational facilities in this state in order to provide for a
clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect the health and welfare of
the citizens and residents of this state.
(7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society threatens the
capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of waste disposal means
that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and hazardous materials are being
buried and pose a constant threat to the ground water supply. In addition, the
nature of the waste and the disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain
basically inert for decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
(b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a potential
resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to the environment
and to the public health and welfare;
(c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire to
avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have caused many
smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume facilities. Larger
operations allow for better ground water protection at a relatively lower and
more manageable cost;
(d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
(e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist counties,
cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal Cooperation Act and the
Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with the construction and
operation of new solid waste disposal areas or facilities and with the closure,
monitoring, and remediation of existing solid waste disposal areas and
facilities;
(f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal
areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and remediation of
existing and former solid waste disposal areas and facilities in the state is
essential to protect the environment and the public health and welfare;
(g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1, 1993,
all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to meet
stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure, monitoring, and
remediation requirements; and
(h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied through
the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or both but may
be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to encourage the
investment of private capital and to assist in the financing of solid waste
disposal areas and facilities and in the removal of environmental hazards in
solid waste disposal areas and facilities in this state in order to provide for
a clean environment to protect the health and welfare of the citizens and
residents of this state.
(8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must be
effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save lives,
to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
(b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for use by
Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska Public Safety
Communication System Act;
(c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies. Since the
maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the cost of purchasing
and operating multiple communication infrastructures is prohibitive, it is
imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in their efforts to obtain
real and personal property to establish, operate, maintain, and manage public
safety communication systems; and
(d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist political
subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal Cooperation Act and
the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition, construction, and operation
of real and personal property of public safety communication systems.
(9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27, 2005,
and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects, there is a need
to increase both the limit on individual net worth and the limit on the
aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the authority. Such adjustments
are necessary to address the inadequate supply of and pressing need for farm
credit and agricultural loan financing at interest rates and terms that are
consistent with the needs of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other
agricultural enterprises.
(10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy the
problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal sources;
(b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance Authority
Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies and private
entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such public-private
and intergovernmental cooperation; and
(c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made available
to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of the economy to
enable the authority to address the problems identified in this section.

Sec. 364. Section 66-1344, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024,
is amended to read:
66-1344 (1) Beginning June 1, 2000, during such period as funds remain in
the Ethanol Production Incentive Cash Fund, any ethanol facility shall receive
a credit of seven and one-half cents per gallon of ethanol, before denaturing,
for new production for a period not to exceed thirty-six consecutive months.
For purposes of this subsection, new production means production which results
from the expansion of an existing facility's capacity by at least two million
gallons first placed into service after June 1, 1999, as certified by the
facility's design engineer to the Department of Revenue. For expansion of an
existing facility's capacity, new production means production in excess of the
average of the highest three months of ethanol production at an ethanol
facility during the twenty-four-month period immediately preceding
certification of the facility by the design engineer. No credits shall be
allowed under this subsection for expansion of an existing facility's capacity
until production is in excess of twelve times the three-month average amount
determined under this subsection during any twelve-consecutive-month period
beginning no sooner than June 1, 2000. New production shall be approved by the
Department of Revenue based on such ethanol production records as may be
necessary to reasonably determine new production. This credit must be earned on
or before December 31, 2003.
(2)(a) Beginning January 1, 2002, any new ethanol facility which is in
production at the minimum rate of one hundred thousand gallons annually for the
production of ethanol, before denaturing, and which has provided to the
Department of Revenue written evidence substantiating that the ethanol facility
has received the requisite authority from the Department of Water, Energy, and
Environment Environment and Energy and from the United States Department of
Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, on or before June
30, 2004, shall receive a credit of eighteen cents per gallon of ethanol
produced for ninety-six consecutive months beginning with the first calendar
month for which it is eligible to receive such credit and ending not later than
June 30, 2012, if the facility is defined by subdivision (b)(i) of this
subsection, and for forty-eight consecutive months beginning with the first
calendar month for which it is eligible to receive such credit and ending not
later than June 30, 2008, if the facility is defined by subdivision (b)(ii) of
this subsection. The new ethanol facility shall provide an analysis to the
Department of Revenue of samples of the product collected according to
procedures specified by the department no later than July 30, 2004, and at
least annually thereafter. The analysis shall be prepared by an independent
laboratory meeting the International Organization for Standardization standard
ISO/IEC 17025:1999. Prior to collecting the samples, the new ethanol facility
shall notify the department which may observe the sampling procedures utilized
by the new ethanol facility to obtain the samples to be submitted for
independent analysis. The minimum rate shall be established for a period of at
least thirty days. In this regard, the new ethanol facility must produce at
least eight thousand two hundred nineteen gallons of ethanol within a thirty-
day period. The ethanol must be finished product which is ready for sale to
customers.
(b) For purposes of this subsection, new ethanol facility means a facility
for the conversion of grain or other raw feedstock into ethanol and other
byproducts of ethanol production which (i) is not in production on or before
September 1, 2001, or (ii) has not received credits prior to June 1, 1999. A
new ethanol facility does not mean an expansion of an existing ethanol plant
that does not result in the physical construction of an entire ethanol
processing facility or which shares or uses in a significant manner any
existing plant's systems or processes and does not include the expansion of
production capacity constructed after June 30, 2004, of a plant qualifying for
credits under this subsection. This definition applies to contracts entered
into after April 16, 2004.
(c) Not more than fifteen million six hundred twenty-five thousand gallons
of ethanol produced annually at an ethanol facility shall be eligible for
credits under this subsection. Not more than one hundred twenty-five million
gallons of ethanol produced at an ethanol facility by the end of the ninety-
six-consecutive-month period or forty-eight-consecutive-month period set forth
in this subsection shall be eligible for credits under this subsection.
(3) The credits described in this section shall be given only for ethanol
produced at a plant in Nebraska at which all fermentation, distillation, and
dehydration takes place. No credit shall be given on ethanol produced for or
-133-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
sold for use in the production of beverage alcohol. Not more than ten million
gallons of ethanol produced during any twelve-consecutive-month period at an
ethanol facility shall be eligible for the credit described in subsection (1)
of this section. The credits described in this section shall be in the form of
a nonrefundable, transferable motor vehicle fuel tax credit certificate. No
transfer of credits will be allowed between the ethanol producer and motor
vehicle fuel licensees who are related parties.
(4) Ethanol production eligible for credits under this section shall be
measured by a device approved by the Division of Weights and Measures of the
Department of Agriculture. Confirmation of approval by the division shall be
provided by the ethanol facility at the time the initial claim for credits
provided under this section is submitted to the Department of Revenue and
annually thereafter. Claims submitted by the ethanol producer shall be based on
the total number of gallons of ethanol produced, before denaturing, during the
reporting period measured in gross gallons.
(5) The Department of Revenue shall prescribe an application form and
procedures for claiming credits under this section. In order for a claim for
credits to be accepted, it must be filed by the ethanol producer within three
years of the date the ethanol was produced or by September 30, 2012, whichever
occurs first.
(6) Every producer of ethanol shall maintain records similar to those
required by section 66-487. The ethanol producer must maintain invoices, meter
readings, load-out sheets or documents, inventory records, including work-in-
progress, finished goods, and denaturant, and other memoranda requested by the
Department of Revenue relevant to the production of ethanol. On an annual
basis, the ethanol producer shall also be required to furnish the department
with copies of the reports filed with the United States Department of Justice,
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The maintenance of all of
this information in a provable computer format or on microfilm is acceptable in
lieu of retention of the original documents. The records must be retained for a
period of not less than three years after the claim for ethanol credits is
filed.
(7) For purposes of ascertaining the correctness of any application for
claiming a credit provided in this section, the Tax Commissioner (a) may
examine or cause to have examined, by any agent or representative designated by
him or her for that purpose, any books, papers, records, or memoranda bearing
upon such matters, (b) may by summons require the attendance of the person
responsible for rendering the application or other document or any officer or
employee of such person or the attendance of any other person having knowledge
in the premises, and (c) may take testimony and require proof material for his
or her information, with power to administer oaths or affirmations to such
person or persons. The time and place of examination pursuant to this
subsection shall be such time and place as may be fixed by the Tax Commissioner
and as are reasonable under the circumstances. In the case of a summons, the
date fixed for appearance before the Tax Commissioner shall not be less than
twenty days from the time of service of the summons. No taxpayer shall be
subjected to unreasonable or unnecessary examinations or investigations. All
records obtained pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the
confidentiality requirements and exceptions thereto as provided in section
77-27,119.
(8) To qualify for credits under this section, an ethanol producer shall
provide public notice for bids before entering into any contract for the
construction of a new ethanol facility. Preference shall be given to a bidder
residing in Nebraska when awarding any contract for construction of a new
ethanol facility if comparable bids are submitted. For purposes of this
subsection, bidder residing in Nebraska means any person, partnership, foreign
or domestic limited liability company, association, or corporation authorized
to engage in business in the state with employees permanently located in
Nebraska. If an ethanol producer enters into a contract for the construction of
a new ethanol facility with a bidder who is not a bidder residing in Nebraska,
such producer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of
Revenue in its application for credits that no comparable bid was submitted by
a responsible bidder residing in Nebraska. The department shall deny an
application for credits if it is determined that the contract was denied to a
responsible bidder residing in Nebraska without cause.
(9) The pertinent provisions of Chapter 66, article 7, relating to the
administration and imposition of motor fuel taxes shall apply to the
administration and imposition of assessments made by the Department of Revenue
relating to excess credits claimed by ethanol producers under the Ethanol
Development Act. These provisions include, but are not limited to, issuance of
a deficiency following an examination of records, an assessment becoming final
after sixty days absent a written protest, presumptions regarding the burden of
proof, issuance of deficiency within three years of original filing, issuance
of notice by registered or certified mail, issuance of penalties and waiver
thereof, issuance of interest and waiver thereof, and issuance of corporate
officer or employee or limited liability company manager or member assessments.
For purposes of determining interest and penalties, the due date will be
considered to be the date on which the credits were used by the licensees to
whom the credits were transferred.
(10) If a written protest is filed by the ethanol producer with the
department within the sixty-day period in subsection (9) of this section, the
protest shall: (a) Identify the ethanol producer; (b) identify the proposed
assessment which is being protested; (c) set forth each ground under which a
-134-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
redetermination of the department's position is requested together with facts
sufficient to acquaint the department with the exact basis thereof; (d) demand
the relief to which the ethanol producer considers itself entitled; and (e)
request that an evidentiary hearing be held to determine any issues raised by
the protest if the ethanol producer desires such a hearing.
(11) For applications received after April 16, 2004, an ethanol facility
receiving benefits under the Ethanol Development Act shall not be eligible for
benefits under the Employment and Investment Growth Act, the Invest Nebraska
Act, the Nebraska Advantage Act, or the ImagiNE Nebraska Act.

81-15,118 The Legislature finds that the number of leaking underground
storage tanks throughout the state is increasing and that there exists a
serious threat to the health and safety of citizens because substances
contained in leaking storage tanks are often potential ground water
contaminants and major fire and explosive hazards.
For the reasons stated in this section, the Legislature deems it necessary
to provide a program of storage tank registration and inspection as a
preventative measure and a comprehensive leak cleanup program as a responsive
measure. Primary responsibility for the Petroleum Products and Hazardous
Substances Storage and Handling Act shall be with the Department of Water,

corrective action by the State Fire Marshal and the Department of Water,
Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy. In the event that the State
Fire Marshal or the department finds an adverse effect caused by a release of a
regulated substance from a tank:
(1) The State Fire Marshal shall (a) determine the immediate danger
presented by the release, (b) take all steps necessary to assure immediate
public safety, and (c) assist the department in determining the source of the
release and taking all steps necessary to ensure that the release is halted;
(2) By order of the department, the owner or operator of the tank causing
the release shall, after securing the source of the release, develop a plan for
remedial action to be approved by the department. The department shall inform
the owner or operator of its approval or disapproval of a plan for remedial
action within one hundred twenty days after receipt of a remedial action plan
which contains all required information. If after one hundred twenty days the
department fails to either deny, approve, or amend the remedial action plan
submitted, the proposed plan shall be deemed approved; and
(3) The approved remedial action plan shall then be carried out by the
owner or operator of the tank causing the release. All expenses incurred during
the remedial action shall be paid by the owner or operator subject to
reimbursement pursuant to the Petroleum Release Remedial Action Act.
If it is determined that the source of the release is unknown or that the
owner or operator of the facility causing the release is unknown or
unavailable, a remedial action plan shall be developed by or under the
direction of the department. Such remedial action plan shall be developed and
carried out by the department with money from the Petroleum Products and
Hazardous Substances Storage and Handling Fund if funds are available. If at a
later date the owner or operator of the facility which caused the release is
determined, he or she shall be responsible for remedial action costs incurred
on his or her behalf subject to reimbursement pursuant to the Petroleum Release
Remedial Action Act. Any money received from such person shall be deposited in

person as defined in section 66-1514 is approved or deemed to be approved by
the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy
pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 81-15,124 and has been carried out, the
department may issue to the responsible person a certificate of completion
stating that no further remedial action needs to be taken at the site relating
to any contamination for which remedial action has already been taken in
accordance with the approved remedial action plan. The department shall
condition the certificate of completion upon compliance with any monitoring,
institutional, or technological controls that may be necessary and which were
relied upon by the responsible person to demonstrate compliance with the
remedial action plan. Any certificate of completion issued pursuant to this
section shall be in a form which can be filed for record in the real estate
records of the county in which the remedial action took place. The responsible
person shall file the certificate of completion and notify the department
within ten days after issuance as to the date and location of the real estate
filing. If the department issues a certificate of completion to a responsible
person under this section, a covenant not to sue shall arise by operation of
law subject to subsection (2) of this section. The covenant not to sue releases
the responsible person from liability to the state and from liability to
perform additional environmental assessment, remedial activity, or response
action with regard to the release of a petroleum product for which the
-160-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
responsible person has complied with the requirements of this subsection. The
covenant not to sue shall be voided if the responsible person fails to conduct
additional remedial action as required under subsection (2) of this section, if
a certificate of completion is revoked by the department under subsection (3)
of this section, or if the responsible person fails to comply with the
monitoring, institutional, or technological controls, if any, upon which the
certificate of completion is conditioned.
(2) A certificate of completion issued by the department under subsection
(1) of this section shall require the responsible person to conduct additional
remedial action in the event that any monitoring conducted at or near the real
property or other circumstances indicate that (a) contamination is reoccurring,
(b) additional contamination is present for which remedial action was not taken
according to the remedial action plan, or (c) contamination from the site
presents a threat to human health or the environment and was not addressed in
the remedial action plan.
(3) A certificate of completion shall be revoked if the department
demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that any approval provided
under this section was obtained by fraud or material misrepresentation, knowing
failure to disclose material information, or false certification to the
department. The department shall file a copy of the notice of revocation of any
certificate of completion in the real estate records of the county in which the
remedial action took place within ten days after such revocation.
(4) If a responsible person transfers property to an affiliate in order
for that affiliate to obtain a benefit to which the transferor would not
otherwise be eligible under this section or to avoid an obligation under this
section, the affiliate shall be subject to the same obligations and obtain the
same level of benefits as those available to the transferor under this section.
(5)(a) A covenant not to sue arising under subsection (1) of this section,
unless voided pursuant to such subsection, shall bar suit against any person
who acquires title to property to which a certificate of completion applies for
all claims of the state or any other person in connection with petroleum
products which were the subject of an approved remedial action plan and (b) a
person who purchased a site before May 31, 2001, is released, upon the issuance
of a certificate of completion under this section or upon the issuance of a no
further action letter on or after May 31, 2001, pursuant to section 81-15,186,
from all liability to the state for cleanup of contamination that was released
at the site covered by the certificate of completion or the no further action
letter before the purchase date, except as provided in subsection (4) of this
section, for releases or consequences that the person contributed to or caused,
for failure by such person to comply with the monitoring, institutional, or
technological controls, if any, upon which the certificate of completion is
conditioned, or in the event the certificate of completion is revoked by the
department under subsection (3) of this section.
(6) Any person entitled to the protections of the covenant not to sue or
eligible to be released from liability pursuant to the issuance of a
certificate of completion or a no further action letter under subsection (5) of
this section who is ordered by the department to take remedial action shall be
eligible for reimbursement as a responsible person pursuant to section 66-1525
and shall not be required to pay the first cost or percent of the remaining
cost as provided in subsection (1) of section 66-1523 unless such person
contributed to or caused the release or failed to comply with the monitoring,
institutional, or technological controls, if any, imposed under subsection (1)
of this section.
