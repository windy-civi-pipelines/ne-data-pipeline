2 2-3241 Each district shall have the power and authority to provide
3 technical and other assistance as may be necessary or desirable in rural
4 areas to abate the lowering of water quality in the state caused by
5 sedimentation, effluent from feedlots, and runoff from cropland areas
6 containing agricultural chemicals. Such assistance shall be coordinated
7 with the programs and the stream quality standards as established by the
8 department Department of Environment and Energy.
9 Sec. 28. Section 2-3254, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
10 amended to read:
11 2-3254 (1) The board shall hold a hearing upon the question of the
12 desirability and necessity, in the interest of the public health, safety,
13 and welfare, of the establishment of or altering the boundaries of an
14 existing improvement project area and the undertaking of such a project,
15 upon the question of the appropriate boundaries describing affected land,
16 upon the propriety of the petition, and upon all relevant questions
17 regarding such inquiries. When a hearing has been initiated by petition,
18 such hearing shall be held within one hundred twenty days of the filing
19 of such petition. Notice of such hearing shall be published prior thereto
20 once each week for three consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper published
21 or of general circulation in the district. Landowners within the limits
22 of the territory described in the petition and all other interested
23 parties, including any appropriate agencies of state or federal
24 government, shall have the right to be heard. If the board finds, after
25 consultation with such appropriate agencies of state and federal
26 government and after the hearing, that the project conforms with all
27 applicable law and with the district's goals, criteria, and policies, it
28 shall enter its findings in the board's official records and shall, with
29 the aid of such engineers, surveyors, and other assistants as it may have
30 chosen, establish an improvement project area or alter the boundaries of
31 an existing improvement project area, proceed to make detailed plans and
-39-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 cost estimates, determine the total benefits, and carry out the project
2 as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. If the board
3 finds that the project does not so conform, the findings shall be entered
4 in the board's records and copies of such findings shall be furnished to
5 the petitioners and the commission.
6 (2) When any such special project would result in the provision of
7 revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall, prior to
8 commencement of construction of such project, determine, by circulation
9 of petitions or by some other appropriate method, if such project can be
10 reasonably expected to generate sufficient revenue to recover the
11 reimbursable costs thereof. If it is determined that the project cannot
12 be reasonably expected to generate sufficient revenue, the project and
13 all work in connection therewith shall be suspended. If it is determined
14 that the project can be reasonably expected to generate sufficient
15 revenue, the board shall divide the total benefits of the project as
16 provided in sections 2-3252 to 2-3254. If the proposed project involves
17 the supply of water for any beneficial use, including a public water
18 system as defined in section 71-5301, all plans and specifications for
19 the project shall be filed with the secretary of the district and the
20 Director of Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources, except that
21 if such project involves a public water system as defined in section
22 71-5301, the filing of the information shall be with the Department of
23 Environment and Energy rather than the Director of Natural Resources. No
24 construction of any such special project shall begin until the plans and
25 specifications for such improvement have been approved by the Chief Water
26 Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment. When such a
27 special project involves a public water system as defined in section
28 71-5301, the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment shall Director of
29 Natural Resources and the Department of Environment and Energy, if
30 applicable, except that if such special project involves a public water
31 system as defined in section 71-5301, only the Department of Environment
-40-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 and Energy shall be required to review such plans and specifications and
2 approve the same if in compliance with the Nebraska Safe Drinking Water
3 Act and departmental rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under
4 the act. All prescribed conditions having been complied with, each
5 landowner within the improvement project area shall, within any limits
6 otherwise prescribed by law, subscribe to a number of benefit units in
7 proportion to the extent he or she desires to participate in the benefits
8 of the special project. As long as the capacity of the district's
9 facilities permit, participating landowners may subscribe to additional
10 units, within any limits otherwise prescribed by law, upon payment of a
11 unit fee for each such unit. The unit fees made and charged pursuant to
12 this section shall be levied and fixed by rules and regulations of the
13 district. The service provided may be withheld during the time such
14 charges levied upon such parcel of land are delinquent and unpaid. Such
15 charges shall be cumulative, and the service provided by the project may
16 be withheld until all delinquent charges for the operation and
17 maintenance of such works of improvement are paid for past years as well
18 as for the current year. All such charges, due and delinquent according
19 to the rules and regulations of such district and unpaid on June 1 after
20 becoming due and delinquent, may be certified by the governing authority
21 of such district to the county clerk of such county in which are situated
22 the lands against which such charges have been levied, and when so
23 certified such charges shall be entered upon the tax list and spread upon
24 the tax roll the same as other special assessment taxes are levied and
25 assessed upon real estate, shall become a lien upon such real estate
26 along with other real estate taxes, and shall be collectible at the same
27 time, in the same manner, and in the same proceeding as other real estate
28 taxes are levied.
29 (3) When the special project would not result in the provision of
30 revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall apportion the
31 benefits thereof accruing to the several tracts of land within the
-41-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 district which will be benefited thereby, on a system of units. The land
2 least benefited shall be apportioned one unit of assessment, and each
3 tract receiving a greater benefit shall be apportioned a greater number
4 of units or fraction thereof, according to the benefits received. Nothing
5 contained in this section shall prevent the district from establishing
6 separate areas within the improvement project area so as to permit future
7 allocation of costs for particular portions of the work to specific
8 subareas. This subarea method of allocation shall not be used in any
9 improvement project area which has heretofore made a final apportionment
10 of units of benefits and shall not thereafter be changed except by
11 compliance with the procedure prescribed in this section.
12 (4) A notice shall be inserted for at least one week in a newspaper
13 published or of general circulation in the improvement project area
14 stating the time when and the place where the directors shall meet for
15 the purpose of hearing all parties interested in the apportionment of
16 benefits by reason of the improvement, at which time and place such
17 parties may appear in person or by counsel or may file written objections
18 thereto. The directors shall then proceed to hear and consider the same
19 and shall make the apportionments fair and just according to benefits
20 received from the improvement. The directors, having completed the
21 apportionment of benefits, shall make a detailed report of the same and
22 file such report with the county clerk. The board of directors shall
23 include in such report a statement of the actual expenses incurred by the
24 district to that time which relate to the proposed project and the actual
25 cost per benefit unit thereof. Thereupon the board of directors shall
26 cause to be published, once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
27 newspaper published or of general circulation in the improvement project
28 area, a notice that the report required in this subsection has been filed
29 and notice shall also be sent to each party appearing to have a direct
30 legal interest in such apportionment, which notice shall include the
31 description of the lands in which each party notified appears to have
-42-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 such interest, the units of benefit assigned to such lands, the amount of
2 actual costs assessable to date to such lands, and the estimated total
3 costs of the project assessable to such lands upon completion thereof, as
4 provided by sections 25-520.01 to 25-520.03. If the owners of record
5 title representing more than fifty percent of the estimated total
6 assessments file with the board within thirty days of the final
7 publication of such notice written objections to the project proposed,
8 such project and work in connection therewith shall be suspended, such
9 project shall not be done in such project area, and all expenses relating
10 to such project incurred by and accrued to the district may, at the
11 direction of the board of directors, be assessed upon the lands which
12 were to have been benefited by the completion of such improvement project
13 in accordance with the apportionment of benefits determined and
14 procedures established in this section. Upon completing the establishment
15 of an improvement project area or altering the boundaries of an existing
16 improvement project area as provided in this subsection and upon
17 determining the reimbursable cost of the project and the period of time
18 over which such cost shall be assessed, the board of directors shall
19 determine the amount of money necessary to raise each year by special
20 assessment within such improvement project area and apportion the same in
21 dollars and cents to each tract benefited according to the apportionment
22 of benefits as determined by this section. The board of directors shall
23 also, from time to time as it deems necessary, order an additional
24 assessment upon the lands and property benefited by the project, using
25 the original apportionment of benefits as a basis to ascertain the
26 assessment to each tract of land benefited, to carry out a reasonable
27 program of operation and maintenance upon the construction or capital
28 improvements involved in such project. The chairperson and secretary
29 shall thereupon return lists of such tracts with the amounts chargeable
30 to each of the county clerks of each county in which assessed lands are
31 located, who shall place the same on duplicate tax lists against the
-43-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 lands and lots so assessed. Such assessments shall be collected and
2 accounted for by the county treasurer at the same time as general real
3 estate taxes, and such assessments shall be and remain a perpetual lien
4 against such real estate until paid. All provisions of law for the sale,
5 redemption, and foreclosure in ordinary tax matters shall apply to such
6 special assessments.
7 Sec. 29. Section 2-3279, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
8 amended to read:
9 2-3279 All plans submitted by a district under section sections
10 2-3276 to 2-3278, except those filed in compliance with state
11 requirements or for the purpose of state financial assistance, shall be
12 accorded a thirty-day period for review and comment. Failure to reply
13 within thirty days shall be conclusive that the plans have been endorsed
14 by the reviewing agency. All comments on plans shall be reviewed by the
15 district and alterations of the plans may be made as the district deems
16 appropriate. If any state agency comments indicate a lack of conformance
17 with the goals, criteria, and policies of any outdoor recreation plan,
18 any fish and wildlife plan, or indicate a conflict with state policies or
19 plans approved by the Legislature, such plans shall be altered as deemed
20 necessary by the district prior to proceeding with implementation.
21 Sec. 30. Section 2-3280, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 2-3280 No state funds shall be allocated or disbursed to a district
24 unless that district has submitted its master plan in accordance with
25 sections 2-3229 and 2-3276 to 2-3280 and until the disbursing agency has
26 determined that such funds are for plans, facilities, works, and programs
27 which are in conformance with the plans of the agency.
28 Sec. 31. Section 2-4602, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:

5 areas, schools and universities, public utilities and facilities,
6 conversion of grasslands to croplands, and other land-disturbing
7 activities have caused excessive wind erosion and water runoff and
8 accelerated the process of soil erosion and sediment deposition. This has
9 resulted in the pollution of the waters of the state and damage to
10 domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, fish and wildlife, and
11 other resources. It is declared to be the policy of the state to
12 strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities
13 and programs of the state for both rural and urban lands, to improve
14 water quality, and to establish and implement, through the Director of
15 Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources and the Nebraska Natural
16 Resources Commission, a statewide, comprehensive, and coordinated erosion
17 and sediment control program to reduce damage from wind erosion and storm
18 water runoff, to retard nonpoint pollution from sediment and related
19 pollutants, and to conserve and protect land, air, and other resources of

29 46-2,129 or by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources
30 pursuant to section 46-294 or sections 46-2,122 to 46-2,126.
31 (2) The board of directors may by the adoption of appropriate bylaws
-77-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 provide for the suspension of water delivery to any land in such district
2 upon which the irrigation taxes levied and assessed thereon shall remain
3 due and unpaid for two years. It shall be the duty of the directors to
4 make all necessary arrangements for right-of-way for laterals from the
5 main canal to each tract of land subject to assessment, and when
6 necessary the board shall exercise its right of eminent domain to procure
7 right-of-way for the laterals and shall make such rules in regard to the
8 payment for such right-of-way as may be just and equitable.
9 (3) In times of reduced water supply, when the volume of water is
10 not adequate to be beneficially used when equitably apportioned to all
11 landowners in the district, the board may, after providing notice to
12 landowners in a portion of the district and upon receiving no objections
13 from the majority of such landowners, elect not to deliver water to that
14 portion of the district. Such election shall not subject the district to
15 liability under section 46-160 and shall not affect the rights of
16 landowners in that portion of the district to water deliveries in the
17 future. Any election to not deliver water to a portion of the district
18 shall be made on a year-to-year basis, not to exceed ten years, and such
19 election shall not subject any landowner to adjudication of his or her
20 water right under section 46-229. The board may adjust the tolls or

30 bonded and other indebtedness of the district, but shall in no case pay
31 more than the market value of such outstanding bonds with interest up to
-78-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 the time of payment. In cases when bonds not yet due cannot be redeemed
2 by reason of the refusal of the owner thereof to surrender them before
3 due, the board may invest the surplus money of the district, after paying
4 all debts that can be paid, in state, county, or other safe bonds,
5 bearing the same or greater rate of interest, if possible, than the
6 district bonds thus outstanding, for the purpose of paying such
7 outstanding bonds of the district when due. In case the amount realized
8 from the sale of such district property, together with other money of the
9 district, is insufficient for the payment of all the indebtedness of the
10 district, assessments shall continue to be made against the lands
11 included in the district in the manner provided by law for assessments to
12 pay bonds and other indebtedness of irrigation districts until a
13 sufficient amount is raised to fully pay all obligations of such
14 district.
15 Any balance of funds remaining after the sale or disposition of all
16 property belonging to the district and after all obligations and
17 indebtedness of the district have been paid or discharged shall be
18 distributed by the county treasurer to all assessment payers of the
19 district of record as of the date of the filing with in the Chief Water
20 Officer office of the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
21 Natural Resources of the report referred to in section 46-192. Such

2 Chief Water Officer office of the Department of Water, Energy, and
3 Environment Natural Resources, a report attested by the secretary of the
4 board, stating that the district has disposed of its property and
5 franchises, except for any balance of funds remaining, and has
6 discontinued operation, which report shall be recorded in the
7 miscellaneous record of such counties. Each easement and right-of-way,
8 whether owned by the district in fee or otherwise, shall automatically be
9 terminated and extinguished and such interest together with any canal or
10 other structure shall become the property of the owner of the land upon
11 which such easement, right-of-way, canal, or other structure is located
12 or, if owned in fee by the district, shall become the property of the
13 owner of the land adjacent thereto, upon the filing of the report with
14 the Chief Water Officer department. If any person has any claim against
15 such district which is not settled or disposed of at the time of the
16 filing of such report and such person fails or neglects to bring suit
17 upon such claim within one year after the time of the filing of such
18 report, such claim or claims shall be forever barred as against such
19 district as well as against all persons and property therein.
20 Sec. 65. Section 46-193, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-193 As soon as practicable after the organization of any such
23 district, the board of directors shall, by a resolution entered on its
24 record, formulate a general plan of its proposed operation in which it
25 shall state (1) what constructed works or other property it proposes to
26 purchase and the cost of purchasing the same and (2) what construction
27 work it proposes to do and how it proposes to raise the funds for
28 carrying out such plan. For the purpose of ascertaining the cost of any
29 such construction work, the board shall cause such surveys, examinations,
30 and plans to be made as will demonstrate the practicability of such plan
31 and furnish the proper basis for an estimate of the costs of carrying out
-80-

9 because of the unavailability of water may be deemed to exist may be
10 extended beyond thirty years by the Chief Water Officer department upon
11 petition therefor by the owner of the appropriation if the Chief Water
12 Officer department determines that an integrated management plan being
13 implemented in the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved is likely to

24 following:
25 (a) For any tract of land under separate ownership, the available
26 supply was used but on only part of the land under the appropriation
27 because of an inadequate water supply;
28 (b) The appropriation is a storage appropriation and there was an
29 inadequate water supply to provide the water for the storage
30 appropriation or less than the full amount of the storage appropriation
31 was needed to keep the reservoir full; or

8 prevented or restricted such use;
9 (b) Use of the water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions;
10 (c) Circumstances were such that a prudent person, following the
11 principles of good husbandry, would not have been expected to use the
12 water;
13 (d) The works, diversions, or other facilities essential to use the
14 water were destroyed by a cause not within the control of the owner of

25 district, a reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district,
26 a mutual irrigation company or canal company, or the United States Bureau
27 of Reclamation and the Chief Water Officer director determines that water
28 under that appropriation has not been used on a specific parcel of land
29 for more than five years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse
30 exists, the right to use water under that appropriation on that parcel
31 shall be terminated and notice of the termination shall be posted on the

20 that portion of the appropriation to other land, does not file an
21 application for a transfer within the five-year period, or does not
22 notify the Chief Water Officer department within thirty days after any
23 such assignment, that portion of the appropriation shall be canceled
24 without further proceedings by the Chief Water Officer department and the
25 district or company involved shall be so notified by the Chief Water
26 Officer department. During the time within which assignment of a portion
27 of an appropriation is pending, the allowable diversion rate for the
28 appropriation involved shall be reduced, as necessary, to avoid
29 inconsistency with the rate allowed by section 46-231 or with any greater
30 rate previously approved for such appropriation by the Chief Water
31 Officer director in accordance with section 46-229.06.

4 used at the new location for more than five years and that no sufficient
5 cause for such nonuse exists, the right to use that appropriation at the
6 temporary location of use shall be terminated. Notice of that termination
7 shall be posted on the department's website and shall be given in the
8 manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The
9 right to reinitiate use of that appropriation at the location of use
10 prior to the temporary transfer shall continue to exist for five years
11 after the Chief Water Officer's director's determination, but if such use
12 is not reinitiated at that location within such five-year period, the
13 appropriation shall be subject to cancellation in accordance with
14 sections 46-229 to 46-229.04.
15 (7) If at the time of a hearing conducted in accordance with

24 Sec. 82. Section 46-229.06, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 46-229.06 When a departmental proceeding that is conducted pursuant
27 to sections 46-229 to 46-229.04 concerns the partial cancellation of an
28 appropriation, the Chief Water Officer department may receive evidence on
29 the question of whether, following such partial cancellation, a reduction
30 in the rate of diversion to the maximum rate prescribed in section 46-231
31 would result in an authorized diversion rate less than the rate
-95-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of
2 crops on the lands that remain subject to the appropriation. If the Chief
3 Water Officer director determines, based on a preponderance of the
4 evidence, that such rate would be less than the rate necessary, in the
5 interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops, he or she may
6 approve a diversion rate for the remaining portion of the appropriation
7 greater than the maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such
8 increased rate can be no greater than the rate authorized for the
9 appropriation prior to the partial cancellation and no greater than the
10 rate determined by the Chief Water Officer director to be necessary, in
11 the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands
12 that remain subject to the appropriation.
13 Sec. 83. Section 46-230, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-230 (1) As the adjudication of a stream progresses and as each
16 claim is finally adjudicated, the Chief Water Officer director shall make
17 and cause to be entered of record in his or her office an order
18 determining and establishing the priorities of right to use the water of
19 such stream, the amount of the appropriation of the persons claiming
20 water from such stream and the character of use for which each
21 appropriation is found to have been made, and the address of the owner of
22 each water appropriation.
23 (2) Whenever requested by the Chief Water Officer department, the
24 owner of any appropriation not held by an irrigation district,
25 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
26 irrigation or canal company shall provide the Chief Water Officer
27 department with the name, address, and telephone number of each then-
28 current owner of the appropriation and with the name, address, and
29 telephone number of any tenant or other person who is authorized by the
30 owner to receive opening and closing notices and other departmental
31 communications relating to the appropriation. Each appropriation owner
-96-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 shall also notify the Chief Water Officer department any time there is a
2 change in any of such names, addresses, or telephone numbers. Notice of
3 ownership changes may be provided to the Chief Water Officer department
4 in the manner provided in section 76-2,124 or in any other manner
5 authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. If notice of an
6 ownership change is provided other than in accordance with such section,
7 the notice shall include such evidence of ownership as the Chief Water
8 Officer director may require. Notice of all other changes may be provided
9 in any manner authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. Upon
10 receipt of any new information, the Chief Water Officer department shall
11 update the Chief Water Officer's its records. The Chief Water Officer
12 department shall not collect a fee for the filing of any such information
13 or for updating the Chief Water Officer's its records.
14 Sec. 84. Section 46-231, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 46-231 Each appropriation shall be determined in its priority and
17 amount by the time at which it is made and the amount of water which the
18 works are constructed to carry. An appropriator shall at no time be
19 entitled to the use of more than he or she can beneficially use for the
20 purposes for which the appropriation has been made, and the amount of any
21 appropriation made by means of enlargement of the distributing works
22 shall be determined in like manner.
23 An allotment from the natural flow of streams for irrigation shall
24 not exceed one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of
25 land and shall not exceed three acre-feet in the aggregate during one
26 calendar year for each acre of land for which such appropriation has been
27 made, and an allotment shall not exceed the least amount of water that
28 experience may indicate is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry,
29 for the production of crops. Such limitations do not apply to storage
30 waters or to water appropriations transferred pursuant to sections
31 46-2,122 to 46-2,125 and 46-2,127 to 46-2,129.
-97-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 When storage water is being used in addition to the natural flow,
2 the person in charge of the ditch or canal shall, upon his or her request
3 and within twenty-four hours thereof, be notified in writing by the user
4 of such storage waters of the time of withdrawal from natural streams to
5 be distributed according to law.
6 When an appropriation is for irrigation purposes and the amount is
7 so small that a proper distribution and application is impractical, as
8 much water as the applicant can use without waste may be allotted for a
9 limited time so fixed by the Chief Water Officer department as to give
10 each appropriator his or her just share without violating other rights,
11 so long as (1) the volume of water used in a twenty-four-hour period does
12 not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been allowed at
13 the approved fixed continuous rate for a twenty-four-hour period or (2)
14 the volume of water used in a seven-day, Monday-through-Sunday period
15 does not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been
16 allowed at the approved fixed continuous rate for a seven-day period. The
17 Chief Water Officer department shall determine schedules among
18 appropriators to assure that other rights are not violated.
19 Sec. 85. Section 46-233, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
20 amended to read:
21 46-233 (1) The United States and every person intending to
22 appropriate any of the public waters of the State of Nebraska shall,
23 before (a) commencing the construction, enlargement, or extension of any
24 works for such purpose, (b) performing any work in connection with such
25 construction, enlargement, or extension, or (c) taking any water from any
26 constructed works, make an application to the Chief Water Officer
27 department for a permit to make such appropriation. A permit may be
28 obtained to appropriate public waters for intentional underground water
29 storage and recovery of such water. A public water supplier may make
30 application to appropriate public waters for induced ground water
31 recharge.
-98-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 (2) The application shall be upon a form prescribed and furnished by
2 the Chief Water Officer department without cost to an applicant. Such
3 application shall set forth (a) the name and post office address of the
4 applicant, (b) the source from which such appropriation shall be made,
5 (c) the amount of the appropriation desired, as nearly as it may be
6 estimated, (d) the location of any proposed work in connection with the
7 appropriation, (e) the estimated time required for its completion, which
8 estimated time shall include the period required for the construction of
9 ditches, pumps, and other features or devices, (f) the time estimated at
10 which the application of the water for the beneficial purposes shall be
11 made, which time shall be limited to a reasonable time following the
12 estimated time of completion of the work when prosecuted with diligence,
13 (g) the purpose for which water is to be applied and (i) if for induced
14 ground water recharge by a public water supplier, a statement of the
15 times of the year when and location along a stream where flows for
16 induced ground water recharge are proposed and (ii) if for irrigation, a
17 description of the land to be irrigated by the water and the amount, and
18 (h) such facts and supporting documentation as are required by the Chief
19 Water Officer department which shall include, but not be limited to, the
20 depth of all wells, the extent of the underlying aquifer, the expected
21 rate of recharge, the minimum flow or flows necessary to sustain the well
22 field throughout the reach identified, and the period of time that a well
23 field would continue to meet minimal essential needs of the public water
24 supplier when there is no flow as those factors relate to and are part of
25 an evaluation of pertinent hydrologic relationships.
26 A public water supplier making application for induced ground water
27 recharge may submit with its application a statement of the amount of
28 induced ground water recharge water which the public water supplier
29 presently uses as well as the amount of induced ground water recharge
30 water it anticipates using in the next twenty-five-year period. Such
31 statement shall also quantify the total amount of water the public water
-99-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 supplier presently uses from the well field as well as the total amount
2 of water it anticipates using from the well field in the next twenty-
3 five-year period.
4 (3) Upon receipt of an application containing the information set
5 forth in this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall (a) make
6 a record of the receipt of the application, (b) cause the application to
7 be recorded in its office, and (c) make a careful examination of the
8 application to ascertain whether it sets forth all the facts necessary to
9 enable the Chief Water Officer department to determine the nature and
10 amount of the proposed appropriation. If such an examination shows the
11 application in any way defective, it shall be returned to the applicant
12 for correction, with a statement of the correction required, within
13 ninety days after its receipt. Ninety days shall be allowed for the
14 refiling of the application, and in default of such refiling, the
15 application shall stand dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (4)
16 of this section, if so filed and corrected as required within such time,
17 the application shall, upon being accepted and allowed, take priority as
18 of the date of the original filing, subject to compliance with the future
19 provisions of the law and the rules and regulations thereunder. During
20 the pendency of any application or upon its approval, the Chief Water
21 Officer department, upon proper authorization and request of the
22 applicant, may assign the application a later priority date.
23 (4) For public water supplier wells in existence on September 9,
24 1993, the priority date assigned to an application for induced ground
25 water recharge made by a public water supplier shall be:
26 (a) June 27, 1963, for water supply wells and facilities constructed
27 and placed in service on or before June 27, 1963;
28 (b) January 1, 1970, for water supply wells and facilities
29 constructed and placed in service on or after June 28, 1963, and on or
30 before December 31, 1969;
31 (c) January 1, 1980, for water supply wells and facilities
-100-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1970, and on or
2 before December 31, 1979;
3 (d) January 1, 1990, for water supply wells and facilities
4 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1980, and on or
5 before December 31, 1989; and
6 (e) January 1, 1993, for water supply wells and facilities
7 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1990, and on or
8 before September 9, 1993.
9 (5) Prior to taking action on an application for induced ground
10 water recharge, the Chief Water Officer director shall publish notice of
11 such application at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
12 three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
13 of the stream segment and also in a newspaper of statewide circulation.
14 The notice shall state that any person having an interest may, in
15 writing, object to the application. Any such objection shall be filed
16 with the Chief Water Officer department within two weeks after the final
17 publication of the notice.
18 (6) After the Chief Water Officer director has accepted the
19 application made under subsection (2) of this section as a completed
20 application and published notice as required under subsection (5) of this
21 section, the Chief Water Officer director shall, if he or she determines
22 that a hearing is necessary, set a time and place for a public hearing on
23 the application. The hearing shall be held within reasonable proximity to
24 the area in which the wells are or would be located. At the hearing the
25 applicant shall present all hydrological data and other evidence
26 supporting its application. All interested parties shall be allowed to
27 testify and present evidence relative to the application.
28 (7) An unapproved application pending on August 26, 1983, may be
29 amended to include appropriation for intentional underground water
30 storage and recovery of such water.
31 (8) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer department
-101-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 for a temporary permit to appropriate water. The same standards for
2 granting a permanent appropriation shall apply for granting such
3 temporary permit except when the temporary permit is for road
4 construction or other public use construction and the amount of water
5 requested is less than ten acre-feet in total volume. For temporary
6 permits for public-use construction, the applicant shall include on the
7 application the location of the diversion, the location of use, a
8 description of the project, the amount of water requested, and the person
9 to contact. Temporary permits for public-use construction and for less
10 than ten acre-feet in total volume may be granted without any
11 determination of unappropriated water and shall be considered to be in
12 the public interest. The requirement of filing a map or plans with the
13 application for a temporary permit may be waived at the discretion of the
14 Chief Water Officer director. In granting a temporary permit, the Chief
15 Water Officer director shall specify a date on which the right to
16 appropriate water under the permit shall expire. Under no circumstances
17 shall such date be longer than one calendar year after the date the
18 temporary permit was granted. Temporary permits shall be administered
19 during times of shortage based on priority. The right to appropriate
20 water shall automatically terminate on the date specified by the Chief
21 Water Officer director on the temporary permit without further action by
22 the Chief Water Officer department.
23 (9) Water may be diverted from any stream, reservoir, or canal by
24 any fire department or emergency response services for the purpose of
25 extinguishing a fire in progress in an emergency without obtaining a
26 permit from the Chief Water Officer department. The installation of a dry
27 well for this purpose is allowed without the prior permission of the
28 Chief Water Officer department, but the Chief Water Officer department
29 shall be informed of any such installation, its location, and the party
30 responsible for its installation and maintenance within thirty days after
31 the installation.

1 Sec. 86. Section 46-233.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 46-233.01 (1) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer
4 department for a permit to appropriate any of the public surface waters
5 of the State of Nebraska to be diverted or stored in Nebraska for use in
6 any other state.
7 (2) In determining whether to grant such application, the Chief
8 Water Officer director shall consider the following factors:
9 (a) Whether unappropriated water exists in the source of supply
10 named in the application;
11 (b) Whether such application and appropriation when perfected are
12 not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
13 (c) Whether denial of the application is demanded by the public
14 interest; and
15 (d) Whether the proposed use is a beneficial use of water.
16 (3) When determining whether denial of such application is demanded
17 by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall consider
18 the following factors:
19 (a) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
20 use;
21 (b) Any adverse economic, environmental, and other impacts of the
22 proposed use;
23 (c) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
24 water;
25 (d) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of not allowing
26 the appropriation and preserving the water supply for beneficial uses
27 within the state;
28 (e) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
29 and
30 (f) Any other factors consistent with the purposes of this section
31 that the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant to protecting the
-103-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 interests of the state and its citizens.
2 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
3 overall benefits to Nebraska are greater than the adverse impacts to
4 Nebraska. The Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying
5 an application shall specify the reasons for such action, including a
6 discussion of the required factors for consideration, and shall document
7 such decision by reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any
8 other sources used by the Chief Water Officer director in making the
9 decision.
10 Sec. 87. Section 46-234, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-234 If there is no unappropriated water in the source of supply
13 or if a prior appropriation has been perfected to water the same land to
14 be watered by the applicant, the Chief Water Officer department may
15 refuse such application. An application may also be refused (1) if
16 existing facilities other than those owned or operated by the applicant
17 are to be utilized and the applicant fails to show, by documentary
18 evidence, agreements with the owner and operator of the facilities to
19 allow the applicant to use such facilities or (2) when denial is demanded
20 by the public interest. The party making such application shall not
21 prosecute such work so long as such refusal continues in force. An
22 application for appropriation shall not be exclusive of any of the lands
23 included therein until the owner or owners of such land give consent to
24 the same in proper form duly acknowledged. No application made or canal
25 constructed, prior to the application of the water and the perfection of
26 an appropriation therefor or the filing of the consent, shall prevent
27 other applications from being allowed and other canals from being
28 constructed to irrigate the same lands or any of them. In case of an
29 application for an appropriation of water for the development of water
30 power, the Chief Water Officer department shall promptly act upon such
31 application and limit the time within which such appropriation shall be
-104-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 perfected to the period within which the proposed power project can be
2 completed by uninterrupted and expeditious construction.
3 Sec. 88. Section 46-235, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 46-235 (1) For applications other than those to appropriate public
6 waters for induced ground water recharge, if there is unappropriated
7 water in the source of supply named in the application, if such
8 application and appropriation when perfected are not otherwise
9 detrimental to the public welfare, and if denial of the application is
10 not demanded by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer department
11 shall approve the application and shall make a record in its office and
12 return the application to the applicant, who shall on receipt thereof be
13 authorized to proceed with the work and to take such measures as may be
14 necessary to perfect such application into an appropriation. The priority
15 of such application and appropriation when perfected shall date from the
16 filing of the application with in the Chief Water Officer office of the
17 department, and the date of filing shall be regarded as the priority
18 number thereof. The Chief Water Officer department may, upon examination
19 of such application, approve it for a shorter period of time for
20 perfecting the proposed appropriation or for a smaller amount of water or
21 of land than applied for. The Chief Water Officer department may also
22 impose such other reasonable conditions as the Chief Water Officer it
23 deems appropriate to protect the public interest. An applicant aggrieved
24 by the action of the Chief Water Officer department shall, upon proper
25 showing, be granted a hearing before the Chief Water Officer department,
26 which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
27 procedure adopted by the Chief Water Officer department, and a full and
28 complete record shall be kept of all such proceedings. When a complete
29 record of the case has been made up, the Chief Water Officer department
30 shall render an opinion of facts and of law based upon the evidence
31 before the Chief Water Officer it.

2025 2025
1 (2)(a) An application for an induced ground water recharge
2 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
3 service before September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief Water
4 Officer director if he or she finds that:
5 (i) The appropriation is necessary to maintain the well or wells for
6 the use or uses for which the appropriation has been requested;
7 (ii) The rate and timing of the flow is the amount reasonably
8 necessary to maintain the well or wells for the uses for which the
9 appropriation has been requested; and
10 (iii) The application is in the public interest and is not
11 detrimental to the public welfare. There shall be a rebuttable
12 presumption that wells which are the subject of an application pursuant
13 to subdivision (2)(a) of this section are in the public interest and are
14 not detrimental to the public welfare.
15 (b) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application for
16 a well or wells constructed before September 9, 1993, but may
17 specifically deny the applicant the right to request regulation of junior
18 appropriators if the Chief Water Officer director, at the time of
19 approval, finds that the well or wells, at the time of their
20 construction, were not located, designed, or constructed so as to take
21 reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the area to minimize the
22 frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced ground water
23 recharge. Thereafter a public water supplier holding an approved
24 application which has been denied the right to request regulation of
25 junior appropriators may petition the Chief Water Officer director for a
26 hearing to present evidence showing the Chief Water Officer director that
27 the well or wells have been modified, relocated, or reconstructed to take
28 reasonable advantage of the aquifer conditions in the area. If the Chief
29 Water Officer director determines that the well or wells have been so
30 modified, relocated, or reconstructed, the Chief Water Officer director
31 shall cause to be modified the approval of the application to allow for
-106-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 the regulation of junior appropriators, subject to the restrictions or
2 conditions applicable to public water suppliers.
3 (c) An application for an induced ground water recharge
4 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
5 service before September 9, 1993, shall not be subject to the
6 requirements of sections 46-288 and 46-289.
7 (3) An application for an induced ground water recharge
8 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed or to be
9 constructed on or after September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief
10 Water Officer director if he or she makes the findings required by
11 subdivision (2)(a) of this section and further finds that:
12 (a) There is unappropriated water available for the appropriation;
13 and
14 (b) The well or wells involved have been or will be located and
15 constructed to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the
16 area to minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for
17 induced ground water recharge.
18 (4)(a) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application
19 filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section for a smaller amount of
20 water than requested by the applicant. The Chief Water Officer director
21 may also impose reasonable conditions on the manner and timing of the
22 appropriation which the Chief Water Officer director deems necessary to
23 protect the public interest. The Chief Water Officer director may grant
24 an appropriation for specific months of the year if so demanded by the
25 public interest. If the Chief Water Officer director approves the
26 application, he or she shall issue a written order, which written order
27 shall include the findings required by this section, the amount of the
28 appropriation, and any conditions or limitations imposed under this
29 section.
30 (b) In determining whether an application for an appropriation for
31 induced ground water recharge is in the public interest, the Chief Water
-107-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Officer's director's considerations shall include, but not be limited to,
2 the possible adverse effects on existing surface water or ground water
3 users and the economic, social, and environmental value of such uses,
4 including, but not limited to, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife,
5 public water supply, induced ground water recharge for public water
6 supply systems, and water quality maintenance.
7 (c) The stream segment and the determination of a reasonable and
8 necessary amount of water required for induced ground water recharge
9 purposes throughout the reach shall be defined specifically by the Chief
10 Water Officer director in the order issued under this section.
11 Sec. 89. Section 46-235.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 46-235.01 A public water supplier which has received an
14 appropriation for induced ground water recharge pursuant to section
15 46-235 may, from time to time and within twenty-five years after the
16 priority assigned pursuant to section 46-233, petition the Chief Water
17 Officer department for a hearing to present evidence showing that all or
18 part of the original projection for additional water needs specified
19 pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-233 corresponds with the actual
20 use. To the extent the public water supplier is making beneficial use of
21 all or a portion of the water projected in the original application, the
22 right to use such additional water shall vest and the priority date of
23 such anticipated water use shall date back to the priority date assigned
24 pursuant to section 46-233. A public water supplier may not request such
25 a hearing at intervals of less than five years for each approved
26 application.
27 Sec. 90. Section 46-235.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-235.02 (1) Just compensation shall be required if a public water
30 supplier exercises a preference to the injury of a senior appropriator.
31 (2) Just compensation shall be provided by a public water supplier
-108-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 to any injured junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected
2 prior to September 9, 1993, if and to the extent such injury resulted
3 from regulation of junior appropriators requested by the public water
4 supplier to provide water for any purpose other than domestic. Such
5 compensation shall not be required to a junior appropriator if the
6 regulation requested is to provide water for domestic purposes only. At
7 the time any junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected prior
8 to September 9, 1993, is regulated at the request of a public water
9 supplier, the Chief Water Officer department shall determine for each
10 such appropriator the extent to which the regulation is for domestic
11 purposes and the extent to which it is for other purposes.
12 (3) A cause of action for just compensation shall accrue at the time
13 a junior appropriator is regulated by the Chief Water Officer department.
14 Sec. 91. Section 46-235.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 46-235.03 Natural resources districts shall have the authority to
17 impose restrictions or controls on public water suppliers as specified in
18 the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act. Such
19 restrictions or controls may limit the withdrawal of ground water to a
20 greater degree or extent than is otherwise permitted or allowed by a
21 permit issued by the Chief Water Officer department.
22 Sec. 92. Section 46-235.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 46-235.04 (1) Induced ground water recharge appropriations shall be
25 administered in the same manner as prescribed by Chapter 46, article 2,
26 for other appropriations. Appropriations for induced ground water
27 recharge may be canceled and annulled as provided in sections 46-229.02
28 to 46-229.05.
29 (2) The Chief Water Officer department may approve the transfer of
30 priority dates among water wells, including replacement water wells,

1 recharge appropriation, or are part of an application for such an
2 appropriation, to improve the well field's efficiency of operation with
3 respect to river flow. The transfers shall be approved if the Chief Water
4 Officer department finds that (a) the transfers would not increase the
5 quantity of induced ground water recharge under the original priority
6 date or application, (b) the amount of water withdrawn from water wells
7 under the original priority date or application would not increase, (c)
8 the quantity of streamflow needed to sustain well field operation under
9 the original priority date would decrease, (d) the transfer would not
10 impair the rights of other appropriators, and (e) the transfer is in the
11 public interest in the same manner as provided in section 46-235. The
12 Chief Water Officer department may assign multiple priority dates to a
13 single water well that replaces two or more water wells which are
14 abandoned. Replacement water wells installed pursuant to this subsection
15 must be installed within the same well field as the abandoned water well.
16 Notice shall be furnished and any hearing held as provided in sections
17 46-291 and 46-292. For purposes of this subsection, single well field
18 means those contiguous tracts of land owned or leased by the applicant
19 containing two or more water wells subject to induced recharge.

25 application for water power and before placing water to any beneficial
26 use, the applicant shall enter into a contract with the State of
27 Nebraska, through the Chief Water Officer department, for leasing the use
28 of all water so appropriated. Such lease shall be upon forms prepared by
29 the Chief Water Officer department, and the time of such lease shall not
30 run for a greater period than fifty years; and for the use of water for
31 power purposes the applicant shall pay into the state treasury on or
-110-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 before January 1 each year fifteen dollars for each one hundred
2 horsepower for all water so appropriated. Upon application of the lessee
3 or its assigns, the Chief Water Officer department shall renew the lease
4 so as to continue it and the water appropriation in full force and effect
5 for an additional period of fifty years.
6 Upon the failure of the applicant to comply with any of the
7 provisions of such lease and the failure to pay any of such fees, the
8 Chief Water Officer department shall notify the lessee that the required
9 fees have not been paid to the Chief Water Officer department or that the
10 lessee is not otherwise in compliance with the provisions of the lease.
11 If the lessee has not come into compliance with all provisions of the
12 lease or has not paid to the Chief Water Officer department all required
13 fees within fifteen calendar days after the date of such notice, the
14 Chief Water Officer department shall issue an order denying the applicant
15 the right to divert or otherwise use the water appropriation for power
16 production. The Chief Water Officer department shall rescind the order
17 denying use of the water appropriation at such time as the lessee has
18 come into compliance with all provisions of the lease and has paid all
19 required fees to the Chief Water Officer department. If after forty-five
20 calendar days from the date of issuance of the order the lessee is not in
21 compliance with all provisions of the lease or required fees have not
22 been paid to the Chief Water Officer department, such lease and water
23 appropriation shall be canceled by the Chief Water Officer department.
24 Sec. 94. Section 46-237, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 46-237 (1) Within six months after approval and allowance of an
27 application other than an application to appropriate public waters for
28 induced ground water recharge, the applicant shall file with in the Chief
29 Water Officer office of the department a map or plat which shall conform
30 to the rules and regulations of the department as to material, size,
31 coloring, and scale. Such map or plat shall show the source from which
-111-

1 the proposed appropriation is to be taken and all proposed dams, dikes,
2 reservoirs, canals, powerhouses, and other structures for the purpose of
3 storing, conveying, or using water for any purpose whatsoever and their
4 true courses or positions in connection with the boundary lines and
5 corners of lands which they occupy. The lands to be irrigated shall be
6 identified in the manner prescribed by the department. No rights shall be
7 deemed to have been acquired until the provisions of this section have
8 been complied with. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section,
9 failure to so comply shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all
10 rights thereunder.
11 (2) For any appropriation with a priority date earlier than 1958 but
12 for which either the appropriator has failed to comply with the
13 requirements of subsection (1) of this section or a map or plat required
14 by such subsection has been lost or destroyed through no fault of the
15 appropriator, the lack of such compliance or of such map or plat shall
16 not be the basis for an a departmental adjudication or cancellation of
17 the appropriation by the Chief Water Officer and the appropriation shall
18 not be subject to legal challenge by any party on that basis.
19 (3) The Chief Water Officer department may notify any appropriator
20 subject to subsection (2) of this section of the need to file a map or
21 plat of lands under such appropriation. Unless the Chief Water Officer
22 department grants an extension for good cause shown, the appropriator
23 shall file the required map within three years after that notification
24 and such map shall conform to the rules and regulations of the Chief
25 Water Officer department as to material, size, coloring, and scale. If
26 the appropriator fails to comply, the Chief Water Officer department may
27 deny the appropriator the right to divert or withdraw water subject to
28 the appropriation until compliance has been achieved.
29 Sec. 95. Section 46-238, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

15 project shall be prosecuted in the manner described in this section and
16 with such a force as shall assure the average rate of constructional
17 progress necessary to complete such work or works within the time
18 stipulated in the approval of such application, notwithstanding the
19 ordinary delays and casualties that must be expected and provided
20 against. A failure to carry on the construction of either an irrigation
21 project or a water power project as outlined in this section shall work a
22 forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the appropriation,
23 and the Chief Water Officer department shall cancel such appropriation.
24 The Chief Water Officer department shall have free access to all records,
25 books, and papers of any irrigation or water power company, shall have
26 the right to go upon the right-of-way and land of any such company, shall
27 inspect the work to see that it is being done according to plans and

2 completion of works, the application of water to a beneficial use, or any
3 of the other requirements for completing or perfecting an application for
4 flow or storage rights as fixed in the approval of an application or
5 otherwise for the appropriation of water. Such extension may be granted
6 upon a petition to the Chief Water Officer department and the showing of
7 reasonable cause. The Chief Water Officer department shall cause a notice
8 of each petition received to be published at the petitioner's expense in
9 at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties
10 of the appropriation once a week for three consecutive weeks. The Chief
11 Water Officer department shall hold a hearing on the issue of extension
12 on the Chief Water Officer's its own motion or if requested by any
13 interested person. If a hearing is held, notice shall be given by
14 certified mail to the applicant, to any person who requested a hearing,
15 and to any person who requests notification of the hearing. The Chief
16 Water Officer department may grant the extension in the absence of a
17 hearing if no requests for a hearing are received. Any interested person
18 may be made a party to such action. Any party affected by the decision on
19 the petition may appeal directly to the Court of Appeals. Subsequent
20 extensions may be made in the same manner.

24 facility, water may be diverted from the stream by the applicant and a
25 compensating amount of water shall be released from the reservoir or
26 facility for the use of downstream appropriators, but the rights of prior
27 appropriators shall not be adversely affected by such exchange of water.
28 (3) The owner of a storage reservoir shall have a preferred right to
29 make such application for a period of six months from the time limited
30 for the completion of such reservoir. The date of the expiration of such

4 The Chief Water Officer department shall monitor movement of the water by
5 measurements or other means and shall be responsible for assuring that
6 such quantities are not subsequently diverted or withdrawn by others
7 unless they are authorized to do so by the person conducting the water.
8 (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section,

2025 2025
1 Act of Congress and the rules and regulations of the United States, to
2 any person who may have theretofore been granted a permit to appropriate
3 a portion of the normal flow of any stream, if the water so appropriated
4 shall, during some portion of the year, be found insufficient for the
5 needs of the land to which it is appurtenant. The United States and every
6 person entering into a contract as herein provided shall have the right
7 to conduct such water into and along any of the natural streams of the
8 state, but not so as to raise the waters thereof above the ordinary high
9 water mark, and may take out the same again at any point desired, without
10 regard to the prior rights of others to water from the same stream; but
11 due allowance shall be made for losses in transit, the amount of such
12 allowance to be determined by the Chief Water Officer Department of
13 Natural Resources. The Chief Water Officer department shall supervise and
14 enforce the distribution of such water so delivered with like authority
15 and under the same provisions as in the case of general appropriators.
16 Sec. 107. Section 46-286, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 46-286 An ephemeral natural stream shall mean that portion of a
19 natural stream in which water flows only after a precipitation event or
20 when augmented by surface water runoff caused by the pumping of ground
21 water for irrigation. The portion of a natural stream that is shown as an
22 intermittent stream on the most recent United States Geological Survey
23 topographic quadrangle map published prior to July 18, 2008, shall be
24 considered an ephemeral natural stream unless the Chief Water Officer
25 Department of Natural Resources has investigated the stream and
26 determined that the stream or a reach of the stream is perennial or
27 intermittent and subject to Chapter 46, article 2. The Chief Water
28 Officer's department's determination for the purposes of this section
29 shall be adopted and promulgated in rule or regulation.
30 Sec. 108. Section 46-288, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
31 amended to read:
-124-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 46-288 For purposes of this section and section 46-289, unless the
2 context otherwise requires:
3 (1) Basin of origin shall mean the river basin in which the point or
4 proposed point of diversion of water is located;
5 (2) Beneficial use shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable
6 and efficient use of water for domestic, municipal, agricultural,
7 industrial, commercial, power production, subirrigation, fish and
8 wildlife, ground water recharge, interstate compact, water quality
9 maintenance, or recreational purposes. Nothing in this subdivision shall
10 be construed to affect the preferences for use of surface water as
11 provided in section 46-204;
12 (3) Interbasin transfer shall mean the diversion of water in one
13 river basin and the transportation of such water to another river basin
14 for storage or utilization for a beneficial use; and
15 (4) River basin shall mean any of the following natural hydrologic
16 basins of the state as shown on maps located in the Department of Water,
17 Energy, and Environment Natural Resources: (a) The White River and Hat
18 Creek basin; (b) the Niobrara River basin; (c) the Platte River basin,
19 including the North Platte and South Platte River basins, except that for
20 purposes of transfer between the North and South Platte River basins each
21 shall be considered a separate river basin; (d) the Loup River basin; (e)
22 the Elkhorn River basin; (f) the Republican River basin; (g) the Little
23 Blue River basin; (h) the Big Blue River basin; (i) the Nemaha River
24 basin; and (j) the Missouri tributaries basin.
25 Sec. 109. Section 46-289, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 46-289 The Legislature finds, recognizes, and declares that the
28 transfer of water to outside the boundaries of a river basin may have
29 impacts on the water and other resources in the basin and that such
30 impacts differ from those caused by uses of water within the same basin
31 in part because any unused water will not be returned to the stream from
-125-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 which it is taken for further use in that river basin. The Legislature
2 therefor recognizes the need to delineate factors for consideration by
3 the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
4 Environment Director of Natural Resources when evaluating an application
5 made pursuant to section 46-233 which involves an interbasin transfer of
6 water in order to determine whether denial of such application is
7 demanded by the public interest. Those considerations shall include, but
8 not be limited to, the following factors:
9 (1) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
10 interbasin transfer and use;
11 (2) Any adverse impacts of the proposed interbasin transfer and use;
12 (3) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
13 water in the basin of origin;
14 (4) Any reasonably foreseeable future beneficial uses of the water
15 in the basin of origin;
16 (5) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of leaving the
17 water in the basin of origin for current or future beneficial uses;
18 (6) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
19 and
20 (7) Alternative sources of water available to the basin of origin
21 for future beneficial uses.
22 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
23 overall benefits to the state and the applicant's basin are greater than
24 or equal to the adverse impacts to the state and the basin of origin. The
25 Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying an application
26 shall specify the reasons for such action, including a discussion of the
27 required factors for consideration, and shall document such decision by
28 reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any other sources used by
29 the Chief Water Officer director in making the decision.
30 Sec. 110. Section 46-290, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
31 amended to read:
-126-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 46-290 (1)(a) Except as provided in this section and sections
2 46-2,120 to 46-2,130, any person having a permit to appropriate water for
3 beneficial purposes issued pursuant to sections 46-233 to 46-235,
4 46-240.01, 46-241, 46-242, or 46-637 and who desires (i) to transfer the
5 use of such appropriation to a location other than the location specified
6 in the permit, (ii) to change that appropriation to a different type of
7 appropriation as provided in subsection (3) of this section, or (iii) to
8 change the purpose for which the water is to be used under a natural-
9 flow, storage, or storage-use appropriation to a purpose not at that time
10 permitted under the appropriation shall apply for approval of such
11 transfer or change to the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
12 Resources.
13 (b) The application for such approval shall contain (i) the number
14 assigned to such appropriation by the Chief Water Officer department,
15 (ii) the name and address of the present holder of the appropriation,
16 (iii) if applicable, the name and address of the person or entity to whom
17 the appropriation would be transferred or who will be the user of record
18 after a change in the location of use, type of appropriation, or purpose
19 of use under the appropriation, (iv) the legal description of the land to
20 which the appropriation is now appurtenant, (v) the name and address of
21 each holder of a mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent consensual
22 security interest against the tract or tracts of land to which the
23 appropriation is now appurtenant, (vi) if applicable, the legal
24 description of the land to which the appropriation is proposed to be
25 transferred, (vii) if a transfer is proposed, whether other sources of
26 water are available at the original location of use and whether any
27 provisions have been made to prevent either use of a new source of water
28 at the original location or increased use of water from any existing
29 source at that location, (viii) if applicable, the legal descriptions of
30 the beginning and end of the stream reach to which the appropriation is
31 proposed to be transferred for the purpose of augmenting the flows in
-127-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 that stream reach, (ix) if a proposed transfer is for the purpose of
2 increasing the quantity of water available for use pursuant to another
3 appropriation, the number assigned to such other appropriation by the
4 Chief Water Officer department, (x) the purpose of the current use, (xi)
5 if a change in purpose of use is proposed, the proposed purpose of use,
6 (xii) if a change in the type of appropriation is proposed, the type of
7 appropriation to which a change is desired, (xiii) if a proposed transfer
8 or change is to be temporary in nature, the duration of the proposed
9 transfer or change, and (xiv) such other information as the Chief Water
10 Officer department by rule and regulation requires.
11 (2) If a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, a
12 copy of the proposed agreement between the current appropriator and the
13 person who is to be responsible for use of water under the appropriation
14 while the transfer or change is in effect shall be submitted at the same
15 time as the application.
16 (3) Regardless of whether a transfer or a change in the purpose of
17 use is involved, the following changes in type of appropriation, if found
18 by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
19 Environment Director of Natural Resources to be consistent with section
20 46-294, may be approved subject to the following:
21 (a) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use may be
22 changed to a natural-flow appropriation for aboveground reservoir storage
23 or for intentional underground water storage;
24 (b) A natural-flow appropriation for intentional underground water
25 storage may be changed to a natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-
26 stream use or for aboveground reservoir storage;
27 (c) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
28 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
29 storage may be changed to an instream appropriation subject to sections
30 46-2,107 to 46-2,119 if the Chief Water Officer director determines that
31 the resulting instream appropriation would be consistent with
-128-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of section 46-2,115;
2 (d) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
3 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
4 storage may be changed to an appropriation for induced ground water
5 recharge if the Chief Water Officer director determines that the
6 resulting appropriation for induced ground water recharge would be
7 consistent with subdivisions (2)(a)(i) and (ii) of section 46-235;
8 (e) An appropriation for the manufacturing of hydropower at a
9 facility located on a natural stream channel may be permanently changed
10 in full to an instream basin-management appropriation to be held jointly
11 by the Game and Parks Commission and any natural resources district or
12 combination of natural resources districts. The beneficial use of such
13 change is to maintain the streamflow for fish, wildlife, and recreation
14 that was available from the manufacturing of hydropower prior to the
15 change. Such changed appropriation may also be utilized by the owners of
16 the appropriation to assist in the implementation of an approved
17 integrated management plan or plans developed pursuant to sections 46-714
18 to 46-718 for each natural resources district within the river basin. Any
19 such change under this section shall be subject to review under sections
20 46-229 to 46-229.06 to ensure that the beneficial uses of the change of
21 use are still being achieved; and
22 (f) The incidental underground water storage portion, whether or not
23 previously quantified, of a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation may
24 be separated from the direct-use portion of the appropriation and may be
25 changed to a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation for intentional
26 underground water storage at the same location if the historic
27 consumptive use of the direct-use portion of the appropriation is
28 transferred to another location or is terminated, but such a separation
29 and change may be approved only if, after the separation and change, (i)
30 the total permissible diversion under the appropriation will not
31 increase, (ii) the projected consequences of the separation and change
-129-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 are consistent with the provisions of any integrated management plan
2 adopted in accordance with section 46-718 or 46-719 for the geographic
3 area involved, and (iii) if the location of the proposed intentional
4 underground water storage is in a river basin, subbasin, or reach
5 designated as overappropriated in accordance with section 46-713, the
6 integrated management plan for that river basin, subbasin, or reach has
7 gone into effect, and that plan requires that the amount of the
8 intentionally stored water that is consumed after the change will be no
9 greater than the amount of the incidentally stored water that was
10 consumed prior to the change. Approval of a separation and change
11 pursuant to this subdivision (f) shall not exempt any consumptive use
12 associated with the incidental recharge right from any reduction in water
13 use required by an integrated management plan for a river basin,
14 subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated in accordance with
15 section 46-713.
16 Whenever any change in type of appropriation is approved pursuant to
17 this subsection and as long as that change remains in effect, the
18 appropriation shall be subject to the statutes, rules, and regulations
19 that apply to the type of appropriation to which the change has been
20 made.
21 (4) The Legislature finds that induced ground water recharge
22 appropriations issued pursuant to sections 46-233 and 46-235 and instream
23 appropriations issued pursuant to section 46-2,115 are specific to the
24 location identified in the appropriation. Neither type of appropriation
25 shall be transferred to a different location, changed to a different type
26 of appropriation, or changed to permit a different purpose of use.
27 (5) In addition to any other purposes for which transfers and
28 changes may be approved, such transfers and changes may be approved if
29 the purpose is (a) to maintain or augment the flow in a specific stream
30 reach for any instream use that the Chief Water Officer department has
31 determined, through rules and regulations, to be a beneficial use or (b)
-130-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 to increase the frequency that a diversion rate or rate of flow specified
2 in another valid appropriation is achieved.
3 For any transfer or change approved pursuant to subdivision (a) of
4 this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall be provided
5 with a report at least every five years while such transfer or change is
6 in effect. The purpose of such report shall be to indicate whether the
7 beneficial instream use for which the flow is maintained or augmented
8 continues to exist. If the report indicates that it does not or if no
9 report is filed within sixty days after the Chief Water Officer's
10 department's notice to the appropriator that the deadline for filing the
11 report has passed, the Chief Water Officer department may cancel the its
12 approval of the transfer or change and such appropriation shall revert to
13 the same location of use, type of appropriation, and purpose of use as
14 prior to such approval.
15 (6) A quantified or unquantified appropriation for incidental
16 underground water storage may be transferred to a new location along with
17 the direct-use appropriation with which it is recognized if the Chief
18 Water Officer director finds such transfer to be consistent with section
19 46-294 and determines that the geologic and other relevant conditions at
20 the new location are such that incidental underground water storage will
21 occur at the new location. The Chief Water Officer director may request
22 such information from the applicant as is needed to make such
23 determination and may modify any such quantified appropriation for
24 incidental underground water storage, if necessary, to reflect the
25 geologic and other conditions at the new location.
26 (7) Unless an incidental underground water storage appropriation is
27 changed as authorized by subdivision (3)(f) of this section or is
28 transferred as authorized by subsection (6) of this section or subsection
29 (1) of section 46-291, such appropriation shall be canceled or modified,
30 as appropriate, by the Chief Water Officer director to reflect any
31 reduction in water that will be stored underground as the result of a
-131-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 transfer or change of the direct-use appropriation with which the
2 incidental underground water storage was recognized prior to the transfer
3 or change.
4 (8) Any appropriation for manufacturing of hydropower changed under
5 subdivision (3)(e) of this section shall maintain the priority date and
6 preference category of the original manufacturing appropriation and shall
7 be subject to condemnation and subordination pursuant to sections 70-668
8 and 70-669. Any person holding a subordination agreement that was
9 established prior to such change of appropriation shall be entitled to
10 enter into a new subordination agreement for terms consistent with the
11 original subordination agreement at no additional cost. Any person having
12 obtained a condemnation award that was established prior to such change
13 of appropriation shall be entitled to the same benefits created by such
14 award, and any obligations created by such award shall become the
15 obligations of the new owner of the appropriation changed under this
16 section.
17 Sec. 111. Section 46-291, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
18 amended to read:
19 46-291 (1) Upon receipt of an application filed under section 46-290
20 for a transfer in the location of use of an appropriation, the Chief
21 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall review it for
22 compliance with this subsection. The Chief Water Officer Director of
23 Natural Resources may approve the application without notice or hearing
24 if he or she determines that: (a) The appropriation is used and will
25 continue to be used exclusively for irrigation purposes; (b) the only
26 lands involved in the proposed transfer are (i) lands within the quarter
27 section of land to which the appropriation is appurtenant, (ii) lands
28 within such quarter section of land and one or more quarter sections of
29 land each of which is contiguous to the quarter section of land to which
30 the appropriation is appurtenant, or (iii) lands within the boundaries or
31 service area of and capable of service by the same irrigation district,
-132-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
2 irrigation or canal company; (c) after the transfer, the total number of
3 acres irrigated under the appropriation will be no greater than the
4 number of acres that could legally be irrigated under the appropriation
5 prior to the transfer; (d) all the land involved in the transfer is under
6 the same ownership or is within the same irrigation district, reclamation
7 district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or
8 canal company; (e) the transfer will not result in a change in the point
9 of diversion or the point of diversion will be changed but the change
10 meets the following requirements: (i) The new point of diversion is on
11 the same named stream, the same tributary, or the same river or creek as
12 the approved point of diversion; (ii) the proposed point of diversion
13 will not move above or below an existing diversion point owned by another
14 appropriator; and (iii) the proposed point of diversion will not move
15 above or below a tributary stream or a constructed river return or a
16 constructed drain; and (f) the transfer will not diminish the water
17 supply available for or otherwise adversely affect any other surface
18 water appropriator. If transfer of an appropriation with associated
19 incidental underground water storage is approved in accordance with this
20 subsection, the associated incidental underground water storage also may
21 be transferred pursuant to this subsection as long as such transfer would
22 continue to be consistent with the requirements of this subsection. If
23 necessary, the boundaries of the incidental underground water storage
24 area may be modified to reflect any change in the location of that
25 storage consistent with such a transfer. Transfers shall not be approved
26 pursuant to this subsection until the Chief Water Officer department has
27 adopted and promulgated rules and regulations establishing the criteria
28 the Chief Water Officer it will use to determine whether proposed
29 transfers are consistent with subdivision (1)(f) of this section.
30 (2) If after reviewing an application filed under section 46-290 the
31 Chief Water Officer director determines that it cannot be approved
-133-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, he or she shall cause a
2 notice of such application to be posted on the department's website of
3 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment, to be sent by certified
4 mail to each holder of a mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent
5 consensual security interest that is identified by the applicant pursuant
6 to subdivision (1)(b)(v) of section 46-290 and to any entity owning
7 facilities currently used or proposed to be used for purposes of
8 diversion or delivery of water under the appropriation, and to be
9 published at the applicant's expense at least once each week for three
10 consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
11 each county containing lands to which the appropriation is appurtenant
12 and, if applicable, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
13 each county containing lands to which the appropriation is proposed to be
14 transferred.
15 (3) The notice shall contain: (a) A description of the
16 appropriation; (b) the number assigned to such appropriation in the
17 records of the department; (c) the date of priority; (d) if applicable, a
18 description of the land or stream reach to which such water appropriation
19 is proposed to be transferred; (e) if applicable, the type of
20 appropriation to which the appropriation is proposed to be changed; (f)
21 if applicable, the proposed change in the purpose of use; (g) whether the
22 proposed transfer or change is to be permanent or temporary and, if
23 temporary, the duration of the proposed transfer or change; and (h) any
24 other information the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant and
25 essential to provide the interested public with adequate notice of the
26 proposed transfer or change.
27 (4) The notice shall state (a) that any interested person may object
28 to and request a hearing on the application by filing such objections in
29 writing specifically stating the grounds for each objection and (b) that
30 any such objection and request shall be filed with in the Chief Water
31 Officer office of the department within two weeks after the date of final

1 publication of the notice.
2 (5) Within the time period allowed by this section for the filing of
3 objections and requests for hearings, the county board of any county
4 containing land to which the appropriation is appurtenant and, if
5 applicable, the county board of any county containing land to which the
6 appropriation is proposed to be transferred may provide the Chief Water
7 Officer department with comments about the potential economic impacts of
8 the proposed transfer or change in such county. The filing of any such
9 comments by a county board shall not make the county a party in the
10 application process, but such comments shall be considered by the Chief
11 Water Officer director in determining pursuant to section 46-294 whether
12 the proposed transfer or change is in the public interest.
13 Sec. 112. Section 46-292, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 46-292 The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources may
16 hold a hearing on an application filed under section 46-290 on the Chief
17 Water Officer's its own motion and shall hold a hearing if a timely
18 request therefor is filed by any interested person in accordance with
19 section 46-291. Any such hearing shall be subject to section 61-206.
20 Sec. 113. Section 46-293, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-293 (1) The Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water,
23 Energy, and Environment Director of Natural Resources shall independently
24 review each application subject to subsection (2) of section 46-291 to
25 determine whether the requirements of section 46-294 will be met if the
26 transfer or change is approved. The requirement of this subsection is not
27 altered when there are objectors who have become parties to the proposed
28 transfer or change, but if a hearing is called by the Chief Water Officer
29 Department of Natural Resources on the Chief Water Officer's its own
30 motion or as the result of a request therefor filed in accordance with
31 subsection (4) of section 46-291, any evidence considered by the Chief

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Water Officer director in making such determinations shall be made a part
2 of the record of the hearing as provided in section 84-914.
3 (2) Either on his or her own motion or in response to objections or
4 comments received pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of section 46-291,
5 the Chief Water Officer director may require the applicant to provide
6 additional information before a hearing will be scheduled or, if no
7 hearing is to be held, before the application will receive further
8 consideration. The information requested may include economic, social, or
9 environmental impact analyses of the proposed transfer or change,
10 information about the amount of water historically consumed under the
11 appropriation, copies of any plans for mitigation of any anticipated
12 adverse impacts that would result from the proposed transfer or change,
13 and such other information as the Chief Water Officer director deems
14 necessary in order to determine whether the proposed transfer or change
15 is consistent with section 46-294.
16 Sec. 114. Section 46-294, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 46-294 (1) Except for applications approved in accordance with
19 subsection (1) of section 46-291, the Chief Water Officer of the
20 Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of Natural
21 Resources shall approve an application filed pursuant to section 46-290
22 only if the application and the proposed transfer or change meet the
23 following requirements:
24 (a) The application is complete and all other information requested
25 pursuant to section 46-293 has been provided;
26 (b) The proposed use of water after the transfer or change will be a
27 beneficial use of water;
28 (c)(i) Any requested transfer in the location of use is within the
29 same river basin as defined in section 46-288 or (ii) the river basin
30 from which the appropriation is to be transferred is tributary to the
31 river basin to which the appropriation is to be transferred;
-136-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,
2 the proposed transfer or change, alone or when combined with any new or
3 increased use of any other source of water at the original location or
4 within the same irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
5 and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company for the
6 original or other purposes, will not diminish the supply of water
7 available for or otherwise adversely affect any other water appropriator
8 and will not significantly adversely affect any riparian water user who
9 files an objection in writing pursuant to section 46-291;
10 (e) The quantity of water that is transferred for diversion or other
11 use at the new location will not exceed the historic consumptive use
12 under the appropriation or portion thereof being transferred, except that
13 this subdivision does not apply to (i) a transfer in the location of use
14 if both the current use and the proposed use are for irrigation, the
15 number of acres to be irrigated will not increase after the transfer, and
16 the location of the diversion from the stream will not change or (ii) a
17 transfer or change in the purpose of use of a surface water irrigation
18 appropriation as provided for in subsection (3), (5), or (6) of section
19 46-290 if the transfer or change in purpose will not diminish the supply
20 of water available or otherwise adversely affect any other water
21 appropriator, adversely affect Nebraska's ability to meet its obligations
22 under a multistate agreement, or result in administration of the prior
23 appropriation system by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
24 Resources, which would not have otherwise occurred;
25 (f) The appropriation, prior to the transfer or change, is not
26 subject to termination or cancellation pursuant to sections 46-229 to
27 46-229.04;
28 (g) If a proposed transfer or change is of an appropriation that has
29 been used for irrigation and is in the name of an irrigation district,
30 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
31 irrigation or canal company or is dependent upon any such district's or
-137-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 company's facilities for water delivery, such district or company has
2 approved the transfer or change;
3 (h) If the proposed transfer or change is of a storage-use
4 appropriation and if the owner of that appropriation is different from
5 the owner of the associated storage appropriation, the owner of the
6 storage appropriation has approved the transfer or change;
7 (i) If the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent, either
8 (i) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the transfer or
9 change is in the same preference category established by section 46-204
10 as the purpose for which the water is to be used after the transfer or
11 change or (ii) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the
12 transfer or change and the purpose for which the water is to be used
13 after the transfer or change are both purposes for which no preferences
14 are established by section 46-204;
15 (j) If the proposed transfer or change is to be temporary, it will
16 be for a duration of no less than one year and, except as provided in
17 section 46-294.02, no more than thirty years;
18 (k) The transfer or change will not be inconsistent with any
19 applicable state or federal law and will not jeopardize the state's
20 compliance with any applicable interstate water compact or decree or
21 cause difficulty in fulfilling the provisions of any other formal state
22 contract or agreement; and
23 (l) The proposed transfer or change is in the public interest. The
24 Chief Water Officer's director's considerations relative to the public
25 interest shall include, but not be limited to, (i) the economic, social,
26 and environmental impacts of the proposed transfer or change and (ii)
27 whether and under what conditions other sources of water are available
28 for the uses to be made of the appropriation after the proposed transfer
29 or change. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall
30 adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to govern the Chief Water
31 Officer's director's determination of whether a proposed transfer or
-138-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 change is in the public interest.
2 (2) The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed
3 transfer or change will comply with subdivisions (1)(a) through (l) of
4 this section, except that (a) the burden is on a riparian user to
5 demonstrate his or her riparian status and to demonstrate a significant
6 adverse effect on his or her use in order to prevent approval of an
7 application and (b) if both the current use and the proposed use after a
8 transfer are for irrigation, the number of acres to be irrigated will not
9 increase after the transfer, and the location of the diversion from the
10 stream will not change, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
11 transfer will be consistent with subdivision (1)(d) of this section.
12 (3) In approving an application, the Chief Water Officer director
13 may impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to protect the
14 public interest, to ensure consistency with any of the other criteria in
15 subsection (1) of this section, or to provide the Chief Water Officer
16 department with information needed to properly and efficiently administer
17 the appropriation while the transfer or change remains in effect. If
18 necessary to prevent diminution of supply for any other appropriator, the
19 conditions imposed by the Chief Water Officer director shall require that
20 historic return flows be maintained or replaced in quantity, timing, and
21 location. After approval of any such transfer or change, the
22 appropriation shall be subject to all water use restrictions and
23 requirements in effect at any new location of use and, if applicable, at
24 any new diversion location. An appropriation for which a transfer or
25 change has been approved shall retain the same priority date as that of
26 the original appropriation. If an approved transfer or change is
27 temporary, the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation
28 shall revert to the location of use, purpose of use, or type of
29 appropriation prior to the transfer or change.
30 (4) In approving an application for a transfer, the Chief Water
31 Officer director may also authorize the overlying of water appropriations
-139-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 on the same lands, except that if any such overlying of appropriations
2 would result in either the authorized diversion rate or the authorized
3 aggregate annual quantity that could be diverted to be greater than is
4 otherwise permitted by section 46-231, the Chief Water Officer director
5 shall limit the total diversion rate or aggregate annual quantity for the
6 appropriations overlain to the rate or quantity that he or she determines
7 is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of
8 crops on the land involved. The Chief Water Officer director may also
9 authorize a greater number of acres to be irrigated if the amount and
10 rate of water approved under the original appropriation is not increased
11 by the change of location. An increase in the number of acres to be
12 irrigated shall be approved only if (a) such an increase will not
13 diminish the supply of water available to or otherwise adversely affect
14 another water appropriator or (b) the transfer would not adversely affect
15 the water supply for any river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been
16 designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined
17 to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 and (i) the number of
18 acres authorized under the appropriation when originally approved has not
19 been increased previously, (ii) the increase in the number of acres
20 irrigated will not exceed five percent of the number of acres being
21 irrigated under the permit before the proposed transfer or a total of ten
22 acres, whichever acreage is less, and (iii) all the use will be either on
23 the quarter section to which the appropriation was appurtenant before the
24 transfer or on an adjacent quarter section.

30 Natural Resources, cause copies of the following to be filed with the
31 county clerk or register of deeds of the county in which the land subject
-140-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 to the appropriation prior to the transfer is located: (1) The permit by
2 which the appropriation was established; (2) the agreement by which the
3 temporary transfer is to be effected; and (3) the order of the Chief
4 Water Officer Director of Natural Resources approving the temporary
5 transfer. Whenever renewal of a temporary transfer is approved pursuant
6 to section 46-294.02, the applicant shall, within sixty days after such
7 approval, cause a copy of the order of the Chief Water Officer director
8 approving such renewal to be filed with the county clerk or register of
9 deeds of such county. Such documents shall be indexed to the land subject
10 to the appropriation prior to the transfer. The applicant shall file with
11 the Chief Water Officer department, within ninety days after the Chief
12 Water Officer's department's order of approval, proof of filing with the
13 county clerk or register of deeds. Failure to file such proof of filing
14 within such ninety-day time period shall be grounds for the Chief Water
15 Officer director to negate any prior approval of the transfer or renewal.

22 approval pursuant to sections 46-290 to 46-294. No renewal or extension
23 shall cause the term of any such temporary transfer or change to exceed
24 thirty years in duration from the date the renewal or extension is
25 approved by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy,
26 and Environment Director of Natural Resources.
27 Sec. 117. Section 46-294.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,

2 amended to read:
3 46-2,111 (1) The Legislature finds that instream appropriations for
4 recreation, fish, and wildlife should consider preferences among
5 different uses and that all appropriations should consider the possible
6 legal relationship between surface water and ground water. Thus the
7 Legislature finds that, since such issues have not been fully considered,
8 the director shall not grant any permit to appropriate water, except as
9 specified in subsection (2) of this section, before January 1, 1997, for
10 any application pending on or filed after June 2, 1995.
11 (2) The Chief Water Officer director may grant applications for (a)

24 consecutive weeks, the last publication to be not later than fourteen
25 years and ten months after the permit was granted or after the date of
26 the Chief Water Officer's director's action following the last such
27 review, whichever is later, and such notice shall be mailed to the
28 appropriator of record and posted on the department's website. The notice
29 shall state that any interested person may file comments relating to the
30 review of the instream appropriation or may request a hearing to present
31 evidence relevant to such review. Any such comments or request for
-146-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 hearing shall be filed with in the Chief Water Officer headquarters
2 office of the department within six weeks after the date of final
3 publication of the notice. The appropriator of record shall, within the
4 six-week period, file written documentation of the continued use of the
5 appropriation. If no requests for hearing are received and if the Chief
6 Water Officer director is satisfied with the information provided by the
7 appropriator of record that the appropriation continues to be
8 beneficially used and is in the public interest, the Chief Water Officer
9 director shall issue an order stating such findings. If requested by any
10 interested person, or on his or her own motion based on the comments and
11 information filed, the Chief Water Officer director shall schedule a
12 hearing. If a hearing is held, the purpose of the hearing shall be to
13 receive evidence regarding whether the water appropriated under the

16 hearing shall proceed under the rebuttable presumption that the
17 appropriation continues to provide the beneficial uses for which the
18 permit was granted and that the appropriation is in the public interest.
19 After the hearing, the Chief Water Officer director may by order modify
20 or cancel, in whole or in part, the instream appropriation.

21 is amended to read:
22 46-2,116.01 If the Chief Water Officer director determines that
23 there is insufficient unappropriated natural flow available for an
24 application for an instream appropriation and if the applicant consents,
25 the Chief Water Officer department may conduct a study to determine
26 whether the instream flow needs can be met through the use of stored
27 water in new storage facilities. The study shall address the availability
28 of storage sites, the estimated cost of providing any required storage,
29 and such other findings and conclusions as the Chief Water Officer
30 department deems appropriate.

17 nonbinding arbitration has concluded further efforts would probably not
18 result in resolution of major issues. The costs of mediation or
19 nonbinding arbitration shall be shared by the parties.

25 necessary amount of water required for instream flow purposes shall be
26 defined specifically by the Chief Water Officer director in the permit.
27 (2) After the water allowed for instream flows has passed through
28 the defined stream segment, all rights to such water shall be deemed

7 (6) If a ground water management area has been adopted by a district
8 under this section that includes one or more controls authorized by
9 subdivision (1)(f) or (1)(m) of section 46-739, the district may request
10 that the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources to conduct
11 an evaluation to determine if an immediate stay should be placed on the
12 issuance of new surface water natural-flow appropriations in the area,
13 river basin, subbasin, or reach of the management area, and the Chief
14 Water Officer department may determine that the stay is in the public
15 interest. The stay may include provisions for exceptions to be granted
16 for beneficial uses as described in subsection (3) of section 46-714 or
17 for a project that provides hydrological benefit to the area of the stay

19 additional information that may become available.
20 Sec. 212. Section 46-713, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-713 (1)(a) By January 1 of each year beginning in 2006 and except
23 as otherwise provided in this section and section 46-720, the Chief Water
24 Officer Department of Natural Resources shall complete an evaluation of
25 the expected long-term availability of hydrologically connected water
26 supplies for both existing and new surface water uses and existing and
27 new ground water uses in each of the state's river basins and shall issue
28 a report that describes the results of the evaluation. For purposes of
29 the evaluation and the report, a river basin may be divided into two or
30 more subbasins or reaches. A river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an
31 integrated management plan has been or is being developed pursuant to
-217-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 sections 46-715 to 46-717 or pursuant to section 46-719 shall not be
2 evaluated unless it is being reevaluated as provided in subsection (2) of
3 this section. For each river basin, subbasin, or reach evaluated, the
4 report shall describe (i) the nature and extent of use of both surface
5 water and ground water in each river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the
6 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department
7 preliminarily considers surface water and ground water to be
8 hydrologically connected and the criteria used for that determination,
9 and (iii) the extent to which the then-current uses affect available
10 near-term and long-term water supplies. River basins, subbasins, and
11 reaches designated as overappropriated in accordance with subsection (4)
12 of this section shall not be evaluated by the Chief Water Officer
13 department. The Chief Water Officer department is not required to perform
14 an annual evaluation for a river basin, subbasin, or reach during the
15 four years following a status change in such river basin, subbasin, or
16 reach under subsection (12) of section 46-714.
17 (b) Based on the information reviewed in the evaluation process, the
18 Chief Water Officer department shall arrive at a preliminary conclusion
19 for each river basin, subbasin, and reach evaluated as to whether such
20 river basin, subbasin, or reach presently is fully appropriated without
21 the initiation of additional uses. The Chief Water Officer department
22 shall also determine if and how such preliminary conclusion would change
23 if no additional legal constraints were imposed on future development of
24 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water and reasonable
25 projections are made about the extent and location of future development
26 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach.
27 (c) In addition to the conclusion about whether a river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
29 department shall include in the report, for informational purposes only,
30 a summary of relevant data provided by any interested party concerning
31 the social, economic, and environmental impacts of additional
-218-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water uses on resources
2 that are dependent on streamflow or ground water levels but are not
3 protected by appropriations or regulations.
4 (d) In preparing the report, the Chief Water Officer department
5 shall rely on the best scientific data, information, and methodologies
6 readily available to ensure that the conclusions and results contained in
7 the report are reliable. In the its report, the Chief Water Officer
8 department shall provide sufficient documentation to allow these data,
9 information, methodologies, and conclusions to be independently
10 replicated and assessed. Upon request by the Chief Water Officer
11 department, state agencies, natural resources districts, irrigation
12 districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation districts,
13 mutual irrigation companies, canal companies, municipalities, and other
14 water users and stakeholders shall provide relevant data and information
15 in their possession. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
16 Resources shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific
17 data and other information that will be considered for making the
18 preliminary determinations required by this section.
19 (2)(a) The Chief Water Officer department shall complete a
20 reevaluation of a river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated
21 management plan has been or is being prepared if the Chief Water Officer
22 department has reason to believe that a reevaluation might lead to a
23 different determination about whether such river basin, subbasin, or
24 reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated. A decision to reevaluate
25 may be reached by the Chief Water Officer department on his or her its
26 own or in response to a petition filed with the Chief Water Officer
27 department by any interested person. To be considered sufficient to
28 justify a reevaluation, a petition shall be accompanied by supporting
29 information showing that (i) new scientific data or other information
30 relevant to the determination of whether the river basin, subbasin, or
31 reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated has become available
-219-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 since the last evaluation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii)
2 the Chief Water Officer department relied on incorrect or incomplete
3 information when the river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated,
4 or (iii) the Chief Water Officer department erred in the its
5 interpretation or application of the information available when the river
6 basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated. If a petition determined by
7 the Chief Water Officer department to be sufficient is filed before July
8 1 of any year, the reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach
9 involved shall be included in the next annual report prepared in
10 accordance with subsection (1) of this section. If any such petition is
11 filed on or after July 1 of any year, the Chief Water Officer department
12 may defer the reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach
13 involved until the second annual report after such filing.
14 (b) If the reevaluation results in a different determination by the
15 Chief Water Officer department, then (i) the Chief Water Officer
16 department shall notify, by certified mail, the affected natural
17 resources districts and any irrigation district, public power and
18 irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
19 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
20 subbasin, or reach of the preliminary change in the determination and
21 (ii) the Chief Water Officer department shall hold one or more public
22 hearings not more than ninety days after the publication of the notice
23 required in subdivision (b)(i) of this subsection. Notice of the hearings
24 shall be provided in the same manner as the notice required in subsection
25 (1) of section 46-714. Any interested person may appear at the hearing
26 and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
27 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
28 (c) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subdivision (b)
29 of this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
30 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
31 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
-220-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
2 (3) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed fully
3 appropriated if the Chief Water Officer department determines based upon
4 the its evaluation conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
5 and information presented at the hearing pursuant to subsection (4) of
6 section 46-714 that then-current uses of hydrologically connected surface
7 water and ground water in the river basin, subbasin, or reach cause or
8 will in the reasonably foreseeable future cause (a) the surface water
9 supply to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the beneficial or
10 useful purposes for which existing natural-flow or storage appropriations
11 were granted and the beneficial or useful purposes for which, at the time
12 of approval, any existing instream appropriation was granted, (b) the
13 streamflow to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the
14 beneficial uses from wells constructed in aquifers dependent on recharge
15 from the river or stream involved, or (c) reduction in the flow of a
16 river or stream sufficient to cause noncompliance by Nebraska with an
17 interstate compact or decree, other formal state contract or agreement,
18 or applicable state or federal laws.
19 (4)(a) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed
20 overappropriated if, on July 16, 2004, the river basin, subbasin, or
21 reach is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among three or
22 more states and if, prior to such date, the Chief Water Officer
23 department has declared a moratorium on the issuance of new surface water
24 appropriations in such river basin, subbasin, or reach and has requested
25 each natural resources district with jurisdiction in the affected area in
26 such river basin, subbasin, or reach either (i) to close or to continue
27 in effect a previously adopted closure of all or part of such river
28 basin, subbasin, or reach to the issuance of additional water well
29 permits in accordance with subdivision (1)(k) of section 46-656.25 as
30 such section existed prior to July 16, 2004, or (ii) to temporarily
31 suspend or to continue in effect a temporary suspension, previously

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 adopted pursuant to section 46-656.28 as such section existed prior to
2 July 16, 2004, on the drilling of new water wells in all or part of such
3 river basin, subbasin, or reach.
4 (b) Within sixty days after July 16, 2004, the Chief Water Officer
5 department shall designate which river basins, subbasins, or reaches are
6 overappropriated. The designation shall include a description of the
7 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department has
8 determined that surface water and ground water are hydrologically
9 connected and the criteria used to make such determination.
10 Sec. 213. Section 46-714, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-714 (1) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
13 Resources makes a preliminary determination that a river basin, subbasin,
14 or reach not previously designated as overappropriated and not previously
15 determined to be fully appropriated has become fully appropriated, the
16 Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate stay on the
17 issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations
18 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer
19 department shall also provide prompt notice of such preliminary
20 determination to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to
21 each natural resources district that encompasses any of the geographic
22 area involved. Such notice to natural resources districts shall be by
23 certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the manager of the
24 natural resources district or his or her designee and shall include the
25 signature of the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources.
26 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by the natural resources
27 district, there shall be a stay on issuance of water well construction
28 permits in the geographic area preliminarily determined by the Chief
29 Water Officer department to include hydrologically connected surface
30 water and ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief
31 Water Officer department shall also notify the public of the preliminary
-222-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
2 appropriated and of the affected geographic area. Such notice shall be
3 provided by publication once each week for three consecutive weeks in at
4 least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in such other newspaper
5 or newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
6 department to provide general circulation in the river basin, subbasin,
7 or reach.
8 (2) If the Chief Water Officer department preliminarily determines a
9 river basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated and has
10 identified the existence of hydrologically connected surface water and
11 ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach, stays shall also be
12 imposed:
13 (a) On the construction of any new water well in the area covered by
14 the determination unless a permit with conditions imposed by the natural
15 resources district has been issued prior to the determination. Such
16 conditions shall meet the objectives of subsection (4) of section 46-715
17 and may include, but are not limited to, conditions in accordance with
18 subsection (6) of section 46-739. Any well constructed pursuant to such
19 permit shall be completed in accordance with section 46-738; and
20 (b) On the use of an existing water well or an existing surface
21 water appropriation in the affected area to increase the number of acres
22 historically irrigated.
23 Such additional stays shall begin ten days after the first
24 publication, in a newspaper of statewide circulation, of the notice of
25 the preliminary determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is
26 fully appropriated.
27 (3) Exceptions to the stays imposed pursuant to subsection (1), (2),
28 (8), or (9) of this section shall exist for (a) test holes, (b)
29 dewatering wells with an intended use of one year or less, (c) monitoring
30 wells, (d) wells constructed pursuant to a ground water remediation plan
31 under the Environmental Protection Act, (e) water wells designed and

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 constructed to pump fifty gallons per minute or less, except that no two
2 or more water wells that each pump fifty gallons per minute or less may
3 be connected or otherwise combined to serve a single project such that
4 the collective pumping would exceed fifty gallons per minute, (f) water
5 wells for range livestock, (g) new surface water uses or water wells that
6 are necessary to alleviate an emergency situation involving the provision
7 of water for human consumption or public health and safety, (h) water
8 wells defined by the applicable natural resources district as replacement
9 water wells, but the consumptive use of any such replacement water well
10 can be no greater than the historic consumptive use of the water well it
11 is to replace or, if applicable, the historic consumptive use of the
12 surface water use it is to replace, (i) new surface water uses and water
13 wells to which a right or permit is transferred in accordance with state
14 law, but the consumptive use of any such new use can be no greater than
15 the historic consumptive use of the surface water use or water well from
16 which the right or permit is being transferred, (j) water wells and
17 increases in ground water irrigated acres for which a variance is granted
18 by the applicable natural resources district for good cause shown, (k)
19 subject to any conditions imposed by the applicable natural resources
20 district, to the extent permitted by the applicable natural resources
21 district, increases in ground water irrigated acres that result from the
22 use of water wells that were permitted prior to the effective date of the
23 determination made in subsection (1) of this section and completed in
24 accordance with section 46-738 but were not used for irrigation prior to
25 that effective date, (l) to the extent permitted by the applicable
26 natural resources district, increases in ground water irrigated acres
27 that result from the use of water wells that are constructed after the
28 effective date of the stay in accordance with a permit granted by that
29 natural resources district prior to the effective date of the stay, (m)
30 surface water uses for which temporary public-use construction permits
31 are issued pursuant to subsection (8) of section 46-233, (n) surface

3 shown, and (o) water wells for which permits have been approved by the
4 Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the
5 Municipal and Rural Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act prior to
6 the effective date of the stay.
7 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any stay imposed
8 pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall remain in
9 effect for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach until the Chief
10 Water Officer department has made a final determination regarding whether
11 the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and, if the
12 Chief Water Officer's department's final determination is that the river
13 basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, shall remain in effect
14 as provided in subsection (11) of this section. Within the time period
15 between the dates of the preliminary and final determinations, the Chief
16 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
17 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public
18 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
19 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
20 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
21 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
22 resources districts. The Chief Water Officer department shall also hold
23 one or more public hearings not more than ninety days after the first
24 publication of the notice required by subsection (1) of this section.
25 Notice of the hearings shall be provided in the same manner as the notice
26 required by such subsection. Any interested person may appear at such
27 hearing and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
28 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Chief
29 Water Officer's department's preliminary conclusions about the extent of
30 the area within which the surface water and ground water supplies for the
31 river basin, subbasin, or reach are determined to be hydrologically
-225-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 connected, and whether the stays on new uses should be terminated.
2 (5) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subsection (4)
3 of this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
4 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
5 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
6 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach. If the final determination is
7 that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief
8 Water Officer department, at the same time, shall (a) decide whether to
9 continue or to terminate the stays on new surface water uses and on
10 increases in the number of surface water irrigated acres and (b)
11 designate the geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer
12 department considers surface water and ground water to be hydrologically
13 connected in the river basin, subbasin, or reach and describe the methods
14 and criteria used in making that determination. The Chief Water Officer
15 department shall provide notice of the its decision to continue or
16 terminate the stays in the same manner as the notice required by
17 subsection (1) of this section.
18 (6) Within ninety days after a final determination by the Chief
19 Water Officer department that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
20 appropriated, an affected natural resources district may hold one or more
21 public hearings on the question of whether the stays on the issuance of
22 new water well permits, on the construction of new water wells, or on
23 increases in ground water irrigated acres should be terminated. Notice of
24 the hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
25 (7) Within forty-five days after a natural resources district's
26 final hearing pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the natural
27 resources district shall decide (a) whether to terminate the stay on new
28 water wells in all or part of the natural resources district subject to
29 the stay and (b) whether to terminate the stay on increases in ground
30 water irrigated acres. If the natural resources district decides not to
31 terminate the stay on new water wells in any geographic area, it shall
-226-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 also decide whether to exempt from such stay the construction of water
2 wells for which permits were issued prior to the issuance of the stay but
3 for which construction had not begun prior to issuance of the stay. If
4 construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior to the
5 stay is allowed, all permits that were valid when the stay went into
6 effect shall be extended by a time period equal to the length of the
7 stay.
8 (8) Whenever the Chief Water Officer department designates a river
9 basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, each previously declared
10 moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in the
11 river basin, subbasin, or reach shall continue in effect. The Chief Water
12 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of such designation
13 to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to each natural
14 resources district that encompasses any of the geographic area involved.
15 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by a natural resources district,
16 there shall be a stay on the issuance of new water well construction
17 permits in any portion of such natural resources district that is within
18 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
19 department. The Chief Water Officer department shall also notify the
20 public of the Chief Water Officer's its designation of such river basin,
21 subbasin, or reach as overappropriated and of the geographic area
22 involved in such designation. Such notice shall be published once each
23 week for three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of statewide
24 circulation and in such other newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the
25 Chief Water Officer department to provide general notice in the river
26 basin, subbasin, or reach.
27 (9) Beginning ten days after the first publication of notice under
28 subsection (8) of this section in a newspaper of statewide circulation,
29 there shall also be stays (a) on the construction of any new water well
30 in the hydrologically connected area if such construction has not
31 commenced prior to such date and if no permit for construction of the
-227-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 water well has been issued previously by either the Chief Water Officer
2 department or the natural resources district, (b) on the use of an
3 existing water well in the hydrologically connected area to increase the
4 number of acres historically irrigated, and (c) on the use of an existing
5 surface water appropriation to increase the number of acres historically
6 irrigated in the affected area.
7 (10) Within ninety days after a designation by the Chief Water
8 Officer department of a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
9 overappropriated, a natural resources district that encompasses any of
10 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
11 department may hold one or more public hearings on the question of
12 whether to terminate the stays on (a) the construction of new water wells
13 within all or part of its portion of the hydrologically connected area,
14 (b) the issuance of new water well construction permits in such area, or
15 (c) the increase in ground water irrigated acres in such area. Notice of
16 any hearing for such purpose shall be provided pursuant to section
17 46-743. Prior to the scheduling of a natural resources district hearing
18 on the question of whether to terminate any such stay, the Chief Water
19 Officer department and the affected natural resources district shall
20 consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
21 and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
22 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
23 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
24 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
25 resources district.
26 (11) Any stay issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect
27 until (a) the stay has been terminated pursuant to subsection (5), (7),
28 or (10) of this section, (b) an integrated management plan for the
29 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Chief
30 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts and
31 has taken effect, (c) an integrated management plan for the affected
-228-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Interrelated
2 Water Review Board and has taken effect, (d) the Chief Water Officer
3 department has completed a reevaluation pursuant to subsection (2) of
4 section 46-713 and has determined that the affected river basin,
5 subbasin, or reach is not fully appropriated or overappropriated, or (e)
6 the stay expires pursuant to this subsection. Such stay may be imposed
7 initially for not more than three years following the Chief Water
8 Officer's department's designation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach
9 as overappropriated or the Chief Water Officer's department's final
10 determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
11 appropriated and may be extended thereafter on an annual basis by
12 agreement of the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
13 resources district for not more than two additional years if necessary to
14 allow the development, adoption, and implementation of an integrated
15 management plan pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-719.
16 (12)(a) For purposes of this subsection, (i) a status change occurs
17 when a preliminary or final determination that a river basin, subbasin,
18 or reach is fully appropriated is reversed by the Chief Water Officer
19 department or by judicial determination and such river basin, subbasin,
20 or reach is determined not to be fully appropriated and (ii) the
21 hydrologically connected area means the geographic area within which the
22 Chief Water Officer department considers surface water and ground water
23 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach to be hydrologically connected.
24 (b) If a status change occurs, any stays previously in force by the
25 Chief Water Officer department or affected natural resources districts
26 shall remain in force until the stays imposed under this subsection are
27 in place and the Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate
28 stay on the issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use
29 appropriations in the river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water
30 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of the status change
31 in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. Immediately upon
-229-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 receipt of the notice by the affected natural resources district, there
2 shall be stays imposed as set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this
3 section, subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (3) of this
4 section. The stays imposed pursuant to this subsection shall remain in
5 effect within each affected natural resources district until such
6 district adopts rules and regulations in accordance with subdivision (c),
7 (d), or (e) of this subsection.
8 (c) Upon receipt of notice of a status change, each affected natural
9 resources district shall adopt rules and regulations within one hundred
10 twenty days after receipt of such notice for the prioritization and
11 granting of water well permits within the hydrologically connected area
12 for the four-year period following the status change. Nothing in this
13 subsection shall be construed to supersede the authority provided to
14 natural resources districts under subsection (2) of section 46-707 and
15 subdivisions (1)(f) and (1)(m) of section 46-739.
16 (d) The rules and regulations adopted by each affected natural
17 resources district in accordance with subdivision (c) of this subsection
18 shall (i) allow a limited number of total new ground water irrigated
19 acres annually, (ii) be created with the purpose of maintaining the
20 status of not fully appropriated based on the most recent basin
21 determination, (iii) be for a term of not less than four years, and (iv)
22 limit the number of new permits so that total new ground water irrigated
23 acres do not exceed the number set in the rules and regulations. The
24 Chief Water Officer department shall approve the proposed new number of
25 ground water irrigated acres within sixty days after approval by the
26 natural resources district if such district meets the conditions set
27 forth in subdivision (d)(ii) of this subsection, based on the most recent
28 basin determination.
29 (e) If the proposed new number of acres is not approved by the Chief
30 Water Officer department within the applicable time period as provided in
31 subdivision (d) of this subsection, the affected natural resources
-230-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 districts shall adopt rules and regulations that allow water well permits
2 to be issued that will result in no more than two thousand five hundred
3 irrigated acres or that will result in an increase of not more than
4 twenty percent of all historically irrigated acres within the
5 hydrologically connected area of each natural resources district within
6 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, whichever is less, for each
7 calendar year of the four-year period following the date of the
8 determination described in this subsection. Each affected natural
9 resources district may, after the initial four-year period has expired,
10 annually determine whether water well permit limitations should continue
11 and may enforce such limitations.
12 (f) During the four-year period following the status change, the
13 Chief Water Officer department shall ensure that any new appropriation
14 granted will not cause the basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully
15 appropriated based on the most recent basin determination. The Chief
16 Water Officer department, pursuant to its rules and regulations adopted
17 and promulgated under the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection
18 Act, shall not issue new natural flow surface water appropriations for
19 irrigation, within the river basin, subbasin, or reach affected by the
20 status change, that will result in a net increase of more than eight
21 hundred thirty-four irrigated acres in each natural resources district
22 during each calendar year of the four-year period following the date of
23 the determination described in this subsection.
24 Sec. 214. Section 46-715, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 46-715 (1)(a) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
27 Resources has designated a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
28 overappropriated or has made a final determination that a river basin,
29 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the natural resources districts
30 encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach and the Chief Water
31 Officer department shall jointly develop an integrated management plan
-231-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The plan shall be completed,
2 adopted, and take effect within three years after such designation or
3 final determination unless the Chief Water Officer department and the
4 natural resources districts jointly agree to an extension of not more
5 than two additional years.
6 (b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin,
7 subbasin, or reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or
8 has not been finally determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly
9 with the Chief Water Officer department, develop an integrated management
10 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach located within the
11 district. The district shall notify the Chief Water Officer department of
12 its intention to develop an integrated management plan which shall be
13 developed and adopted according to sections 46-715 to 46-717 and
14 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-718. The objective of an integrated
15 management plan under this subdivision is to manage such river basin,
16 subbasin, or reach to achieve and sustain a balance between water uses
17 and water supplies for the long term. If a district develops an
18 integrated management plan under this subdivision and the Chief Water
19 Officer department subsequently determines the affected river basin,
20 subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
21 department and the affected natural resources district may amend the
22 integrated management plan.
23 (2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects of
24 existing and potential new water uses on existing surface water
25 appropriators and ground water users shall be considered. An integrated
26 management plan shall include the following: (a) Clear goals and
27 objectives with a purpose of sustaining a balance between water uses and
28 water supplies so that the economic viability, social and environmental
29 health, safety, and welfare of the river basin, subbasin, or reach can be
30 achieved and maintained for both the near term and the long term; (b) a
31 map clearly delineating the geographic area subject to the integrated
-232-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 management plan; (c) one or more of the ground water controls authorized
2 for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant to section 46-739;
3 (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized for adoption by
4 the Chief Water Officer department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a
5 plan to gather and evaluate data, information, and methodologies that
6 could be used to implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase
7 understanding of the surface water and hydrologically connected ground
8 water system, and test the validity of the conclusions and information
9 upon which the integrated management plan is based. The plan may also
10 provide for utilization of any applicable incentive programs authorized
11 by law. Nothing in the integrated management plan for a fully
12 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach shall require a natural
13 resources district to regulate ground water uses in place at the time of
14 the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary determination that the
15 river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, unless such
16 regulation is necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of a basin-
17 wide plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a natural resources district
18 may voluntarily adopt such regulations. The applicable natural resources
19 district may decide to include all water users within the district
20 boundary in an integrated management plan.
21 (3) In order to provide a process for economic development
22 opportunities and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin,
23 or reach, the integrated management plan shall include clear and
24 transparent procedures to track depletions and gains to streamflows
25 resulting from new, retired, or other changes to uses within the river
26 basin, subbasin, or reach. The procedures shall:
27 (a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the best
28 available information, data, and science;
29 (b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized to
30 estimate depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes
31 location, amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to
-233-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 new uses;
2 (c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not have
3 more than a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground
4 water users;
5 (d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and the Chief
6 Water Officer department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share
7 information on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting
8 water use in the river basin, subbasin, or reach;
9 (e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available to
10 mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
11 interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use
12 management, and use retirement;
13 (f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans after
14 consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
15 districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts,
16 municipalities, other political subdivisions, and other water users to
17 make water available for offset to enhance and encourage economic
18 development opportunities and economic sustainability in the river basin,
19 subbasin, or reach; and
20 (g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses shall
21 take to apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.
22 Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment of an
23 integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.
24 (4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed for
25 adoption in the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1) of
26 this section shall, when considered together and with any applicable
27 incentive programs, (a) be consistent with the goals and objectives of
28 the plan, (b) be sufficient to ensure that the state will remain in
29 compliance with applicable state and federal laws and with any applicable
30 interstate water compact or decree or other formal state contract or
31 agreement pertaining to surface water or ground water use or supplies,
-234-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 and (c) protect the ground water users whose water wells are dependent on
2 recharge from the river or stream involved and the surface water
3 appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion caused by
4 surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a river
5 basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily
6 determined to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713,
7 after the date of such designation or preliminary determination.
8 (5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
9 overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more
10 natural resources districts, the Chief Water Officer department and the
11 affected natural resources districts shall jointly develop a basin-wide
12 plan for the area designated as overappropriated. Such plan shall be
13 developed using the consultation and collaboration process described in
14 subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be developed concurrently with
15 the development of the integrated management plan required pursuant to
16 subsections (1) through (4) of this section, and shall be designed to
17 achieve, in the incremental manner described in subdivision (d) of this
18 subsection, the goals and objectives described in subsection (2) of this
19 section. The basin-wide plan shall be adopted after hearings by the Chief
20 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
21 (b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
22 overappropriated and subject to this subsection, the Chief Water Officer
23 department and each natural resources district encompassing such river
24 basin, subbasin, or reach shall jointly develop an integrated management
25 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach pursuant to subsections (1)
26 through (4) of this section. Each integrated management plan for a river
27 basin, subbasin, or reach subject to this subsection shall be consistent
28 with any basin-wide plan developed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
29 subsection. Such integrated management plan shall be developed after
30 consultation and collaboration with irrigation districts, reclamation
31 districts, public power and irrigation districts, mutual irrigation
-235-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 companies, canal companies, and municipalities that rely on water from
2 within the affected area and that, after being notified of the
3 commencement of the plan development process, indicate in writing their
4 desire to participate in such process. In addition, the Chief Water
5 Officer department or the affected natural resources districts may
6 include designated representatives of other stakeholders. If agreement is
7 reached by all parties involved in such consultation and collaboration
8 process, the Chief Water Officer department and each natural resources
9 district shall adopt the agreed-upon integrated management plan. If
10 agreement cannot be reached by all parties involved, the integrated
11 management plan shall be developed and adopted by the Chief Water Officer
12 department and the affected natural resources district pursuant to
13 sections 46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board
14 pursuant to section 46-719.
15 (c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
16 shall identify the overall difference between the current and fully
17 appropriated levels of development. Such determination shall take into
18 account cyclical supply, including drought, identify the portion of the
19 overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
20 development that is due to conservation measures, and identify the
21 portions of the overall difference between the current and fully
22 appropriated levels of development that are due to water use initiated
23 prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated on or after such date.
24 (d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
25 shall adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives
26 identified under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following
27 steps:
28 (i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact of
29 streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water
30 wells constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to
31 the extent those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1,
-236-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 1997, and, unless an interstate cooperative agreement for such river
2 basin, subbasin, or reach is no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow
3 depletions that would cause noncompliance by Nebraska with such
4 interstate cooperative agreement. During the first increment, the Chief
5 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
6 shall also pursue voluntary efforts, subject to the availability of
7 funds, to offset any increase in streamflow depletive effects that occur
8 after July 1, 1997, but are caused by ground water uses initiated prior
9 to such date. The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
10 resources districts may also use other appropriate and authorized
11 measures for such purpose;
12 (ii) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
13 resources districts may amend an integrated management plan subject to
14 this subsection (5) as necessary based on an annual review of the
15 progress being made toward achieving the goals for that increment;
16 (iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated
17 management plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten
18 years after the adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated
19 management plan pursuant to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the
20 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
21 district shall conduct a technical analysis of the actions taken in such
22 increment to determine the progress towards meeting the goals and
23 objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The
24 analysis shall include an examination of (A) available supplies and
25 changes in long-term availability, (B) the effects of conservation
26 practices and natural causes, including, but not limited to, drought, and
27 (C) the effects of the plan on reducing the overall difference between
28 the current and fully appropriated levels of development identified in
29 subdivision (5)(c) of this section. The analysis shall determine whether
30 a subsequent increment is necessary in the integrated management plan to
31 meet the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this
-237-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 section and reduce the overall difference between the current and fully
2 appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of
3 this section;
4 (iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii) of this
5 subsection, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
6 resources districts, utilizing the consultative and collaborative process
7 described in subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall if necessary
8 identify goals for a subsequent increment of the integrated management
9 plan. Subsequent increments shall be completed, adopted, and take effect
10 not more than ten years after adoption of the previous increment; and
11 (v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii)
12 through (iv) of this subsection shall be repeated until the Chief Water
13 Officer department and the affected natural resources districts agree
14 that the goals and objectives identified pursuant to subsection (2) of
15 this section have been met and the overall difference between the current
16 and fully appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision
17 (5)(c) of this section has been addressed so that the river basin,
18 subbasin, or reach has returned to a fully appropriated condition.
19 (6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
20 fully appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure
21 that the state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a
22 formal state contract or agreement, the Chief Water Officer department,
23 in consultation with the affected districts, shall forecast on an annual
24 basis the maximum amount of water that may be available from streamflow
25 for beneficial use in the short term and long term in order to comply
26 with the requirement of subdivision (4)(b) of this section. This forecast
27 shall be made by January 1, 2008, and each January 1 thereafter.
28 Sec. 215. Section 46-716, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 46-716 (1) The surface water controls that may be included in an
31 integrated management plan and may be adopted by the Chief Water Officer
-238-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Department of Natural Resources are: (a) Increased monitoring and
2 enforcement of surface water diversion rates and amounts diverted
3 annually; (b) the prohibition or limitation of additional surface water
4 appropriations; (c) requirements for surface water appropriators to apply
5 or utilize reasonable conservation measures consistent with good
6 husbandry and other requirements of section 46-231 and consistent with
7 reasonable reliance by other surface water or ground water users on
8 return flows or on seepage to the aquifer; and (d) other reasonable
9 restrictions on surface water use which are consistent with the intent of
10 section 46-715 and the requirements of section 46-231.
11 (2) If during the development of the integrated management plan the
12 Chief Water Officer department determines that surface water
13 appropriators should be required to apply or utilize conservation
14 measures or that other reasonable restrictions on surface water use need
15 to be imposed, the Chief Water Officer's department's portion of the
16 integrated management plan shall allow the affected surface water
17 appropriators and surface water project sponsors a reasonable amount of
18 time, not to exceed one hundred eighty days unless extended by the Chief
19 Water Officer department, to identify the conservation measures to be
20 applied or utilized, to develop a schedule for such application and
21 utilization, and to comment on any other proposed restrictions.
22 Sec. 216. Section 46-717, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 46-717 (1) In developing an integrated management plan, the Chief
25 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources and the affected natural
26 resources districts shall utilize the best scientific data and other
27 information available and shall review and consider any rules and
28 regulations in effect in any existing ground water management area that
29 encompasses all or part of the geographic area to be encompassed by the
30 plan. Consideration shall be given to the applicable scientific data and
31 other information relied upon by the Chief Water Officer department in
-239-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 preparing the annual report required by section 46-713 and to other types
2 of data and information that may be deemed appropriate by the Chief Water
3 Officer department. The Chief Water Officer department, after seeking
4 input from the affected natural resources districts, shall specify by
5 rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other information
6 that will be considered in developing an integrated management plan. The
7 natural resources districts shall adopt similar rules and regulations
8 specifying the types of scientific data and other information necessary
9 for purposes of this section. Existing research, data, studies, or any
10 other relevant information which has been compiled by or is in possession
11 of other state or federal agencies, other natural resources districts,
12 and other political subdivisions within the State of Nebraska shall be
13 utilized. State agencies and political subdivisions shall furnish
14 information or data upon request of the Chief Water Officer department or
15 any affected natural resources district. Neither the Chief Water Officer
16 department nor the natural resources districts shall be required to
17 conduct new research or to develop new computer models to prepare an
18 integrated management plan, but such new research may be conducted or new
19 computer models developed within the limits of available funding if the
20 additional information is desired by the Chief Water Officer department
21 or the affected natural resources districts.
22 (2) During preparation of an integrated management plan for a fully
23 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach or of an integrated
24 management plan under subdivision (1)(b) of section 46-715, the Chief
25 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
26 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public
27 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
28 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
29 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
30 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or by the affected
31 natural resources districts. They shall also actively solicit public
-240-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 comments and opinions through public meetings and other means.
2 Sec. 217. Section 46-718, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 46-718 (1) If the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
5 Resources and the affected natural resources districts preparing an
6 integrated management plan reach agreement on (a) the proposed goals and
7 objectives of the plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach,
8 (b) the proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (c) the
9 surface water and ground water controls and any incentive programs that
10 are proposed for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
11 subbasin, or reach, they shall schedule one or more public hearings to
12 take testimony on the proposed integrated management plan and the
13 proposed controls. Such hearings shall be held within forty-five days
14 after reaching agreement and within or in reasonable proximity to the
15 area to be affected by implementation of the integrated management plan.
16 Notice of such hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
17 The costs of publishing the notice shall be shared between the Chief
18 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
19 All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present testimony
20 or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being considered.
21 (2) Within sixty days after the final hearing under this section,
22 the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
23 districts shall jointly decide whether to implement the plan proposed,
24 with or without modifications, and whether to adopt and implement the
25 surface water and ground water controls and incentive programs proposed
26 in the plan. If the Chief Water Officer department and the natural
27 resources districts agree to implement the plan and to adopt and
28 implement the proposed controls, the natural resources districts shall by
29 order designate a ground water management area for integrated management
30 or, if the geographic area subject to the integrated management plan is
31 already in a ground water management area, the order shall designate an
-241-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 integrated management subarea for that area. The order shall include a
2 geographic and stratigraphic definition of the ground water management
3 area or integrated management subarea and shall adopt the controls in the
4 integrated management plan that are authorized for adoption by the
5 natural resources district pursuant to section 46-739. The Chief Water
6 Officer department shall by order adopt the controls in the integrated
7 management plan that are authorized for adoption by the Chief Water
8 Officer department pursuant to section 46-716. Neither the controls
9 adopted by the district nor those adopted by the Chief Water Officer
10 department shall include controls substantially different from those set
11 forth in the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water
12 management area or an integrated management subarea by the natural
13 resources district shall not include any area that was not identified in
14 the notice of the hearing as within the area proposed to be subject to
15 the controls in the plan. The Chief Water Officer department and the
16 natural resources district shall each cause a copy of their respective
17 orders its order to be published in the manner provided in section
18 46-744.
19 (3) If at any time during the development of a basin-wide plan or an
20 integrated management plan either the Chief Water Officer department or
21 the affected natural resources districts conclude that the parties will
22 be unable to reach a timely agreement on the basin-wide plan or on (a)
23 the goals and objectives of the integrated management plan for the
24 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, (b) the geographic area to be
25 subject to controls, or (c) the surface water or ground water controls or
26 any incentive programs to be proposed for adoption and implementation in
27 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Governor shall be
28 notified and the dispute shall be submitted to the Interrelated Water
29 Review Board as provided in subsection (2) of section 46-719.
30 Sec. 218. Section 46-719, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
31 amended to read:
-242-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 46-719 (1)(a) The Interrelated Water Review Board is created for the
2 purposes stated in subsections (2) through (5) of this section. The board
3 shall consist of five members. The board, when appointed and convened,
4 shall continue in existence only until it has resolved a dispute referred
5 to it pursuant to such subsections. The Governor shall appoint and
6 convene the board within forty-five days of being notified of the need to
7 resolve a dispute. The board shall be chaired by the Governor or his or
8 her designee, which designee shall be knowledgeable concerning surface
9 water and ground water issues. The Governor shall appoint one additional
10 member of his or her choosing and shall appoint the other three members
11 of the board from a list of no fewer than six nominees provided by the
12 Nebraska Natural Resources Commission within twenty days after request by
13 the Governor for a list of nominees.
14 (b) Not more than two members of the board shall reside in the
15 geographic area involved in the dispute. A person is not eligible for
16 membership on the board if the decisions to be made by the board would or
17 could cause financial benefit or detriment to the person, a member of his
18 or her immediate family, or a business with which the person is
19 associated, unless such benefit or detriment is indistinguishable from
20 the effects of such action on the public generally or a broad segment of
21 the public. The board shall be subject to the Open Meetings Act.
22 (c) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, action
23 may be taken by a vote of three of the board's five members. For purposes
24 of subsections (4) and (5) of this section, action may be taken only by a
25 vote of at least four of the board's five members.
26 (2)(a) If the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources
27 and the affected natural resources districts cannot resolve disputes over
28 the content of a basin-wide plan or an integrated management plan by
29 utilizing the process described in sections 46-715 to 46-718, the
30 Governor shall be notified and the dispute submitted to the Interrelated
31 Water Review Board. When the board has been appointed and convened to
-243-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 resolve disputes over a basin-wide plan, the Chief Water Officer
2 department and each affected district shall present their proposed basin-
3 wide plans to the board. When the board has been convened to resolve
4 disputes over an integrated management plan, the Chief Water Officer
5 department and each affected natural resources district shall present
6 their (i) proposed goals and objectives for the integrated management
7 plan, (ii) proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (iii)
8 proposed surface water and ground water controls and any proposed
9 incentive program for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
10 subbasin, or reach involved. The Chief Water Officer department and each
11 affected natural resources district shall also be given adequate
12 opportunity to comment on the proposals made by the other parties to the
13 dispute.
14 (b) When the Interrelated Water Review Board concludes that the
15 issues in dispute have been fully presented and commented upon by the
16 parties to the dispute, which conclusion shall be made not more than
17 forty-five days after the board is convened, the board shall select the
18 proposals or portions of proposals that the board will consider for
19 adoption and shall schedule one or more public hearings to take testimony
20 on the selected proposals. The hearings shall be held within forty-five
21 days after the board's selection of proposals to consider for adoption
22 and shall be within or in reasonable proximity to the area that would be
23 affected by implementation of any of the proposals to be considered at
24 the hearings. Notice of the hearings shall be published as provided in
25 section 46-743. The cost of publishing the notice shall be shared by the
26 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
27 districts. All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present
28 testimony or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being
29 considered.
30 (c) Within forty-five days after the final hearing pursuant to
31 subdivision (b) of this subsection, the Interrelated Water Review Board
-244-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 shall by order, as applicable, adopt a basin-wide plan or an integrated
2 management plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and, in
3 the case of an integrated management plan, shall designate a ground water
4 management area for integrated management or an integrated management
5 subarea for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. An integrated
6 management plan shall be consistent with subsection (2) of section
7 46-715, and the surface water and ground water controls and any
8 applicable incentive programs adopted as part of that plan shall be
9 consistent with subsection (4) of section 46-715. The controls adopted by
10 the board shall not be substantially different from those described in
11 the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water management
12 area or an integrated management subarea shall not include any area that
13 was not identified in the notice of the hearing as within the area
14 proposed to be subject to the controls in the plan.
15 (d) The order adopted under this subsection shall be published in
16 the manner prescribed in section 46-744.
17 (e) Surface water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review
18 Board shall be implemented and enforced by the Chief Water Officer
19 department. Ground water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water
20 Review Board shall be implemented and enforced by the affected natural
21 resources districts.
22 (3) Whether an integrated management plan is adopted pursuant to
23 section 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board pursuant to
24 subsection (2) of this section, the Chief Water Officer department or a
25 natural resources district responsible in part for implementation and
26 enforcement of an integrated management plan may propose modification of
27 the goals or objectives of that plan, of the area subject to the plan, or
28 of the surface water controls, ground water controls, or incentive
29 programs adopted to implement the plan. The Chief Water Officer
30 department and the affected natural resources districts shall utilize the
31 procedures in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement
-245-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 on and to adopt and implement proposed modifications. If agreement on
2 such modifications cannot be achieved utilizing those procedures, either
3 the Chief Water Officer department or an affected natural resources
4 district may notify the Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water
5 Review Board shall be appointed and convened in accordance with
6 subsection (1) of this section to resolve the dispute and, if applicable,
7 to adopt any modifications utilizing the procedures in subsection (2) of
8 this section.
9 (4) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
10 resources districts may also raise objections concerning the
11 implementation or enforcement of previously adopted surface water or
12 ground water controls. The Chief Water Officer department and the
13 affected natural resources districts shall utilize the procedures in
14 sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement on such
15 implementation or enforcement issues. If agreement on such issues cannot
16 be achieved utilizing such procedures, either the Chief Water Officer
17 department or an affected natural resources district may notify the
18 Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
19 appointed and convened in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
20 After permitting each party to fully express the its reasons for the its
21 position taken by each party on the disputed issues, the board may either
22 take no action or conclude (a) that one or more parties needs to modify
23 the party's its approach to implementation or enforcement and direct that
24 such modifications take place or (b) that one or more parties either has
25 not made a good faith effort to implement or enforce the portion of the
26 plan or controls for which the party it is responsible or is unable to
27 fully implement and enforce such portion and that such party's
28 jurisdiction with respect to implementation and enforcement of the plan
29 and controls shall be terminated and reassigned to one or more of the
30 other parties responsible for implementation and enforcement. A decision
31 by the Interrelated Water Review Board to terminate and reassign
-246-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 jurisdiction of any portion of the plan or controls shall take effect
2 immediately upon that decision. Notice of such reassignment shall be
3 published at least once in one or more newspapers as necessary to provide
4 general circulation in the area affected by such reassignment.
5 (5) The board may be reconvened in accordance with subsection (1) of
6 this section at a later date upon request to the Governor by the party
7 for which jurisdiction for implementation and enforcement was terminated
8 if such party desires to have the party's its jurisdiction reinstated,
9 but no such request shall be honored until at least one year after the
10 termination and not more than once per year thereafter. The board may
11 reinstate jurisdiction to that party only upon a clear showing by such
12 party that the party it is willing and able to fully implement and
13 enforce the plan and any applicable controls. Notice that a party's
14 jurisdiction has been reinstated shall be provided in the same manner
15 that notice of the earlier termination was given.
16 Sec. 219. Section 46-720, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 46-720 (1) The Legislature finds that, prior to July 16, 2004,
19 actions were taken by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed
20 prior to July 1, 2025, and by one or more natural resources districts
21 pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed immediately prior
22 to July 16, 2004 such date, for the purpose of addressing circumstances
23 that are, after July 16, 2004 such date, to be addressed in accordance
24 with sections 46-713 to 46-719. It is the intent of the Legislature that
25 actions taken pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed
26 immediately prior to July 16, 2004, should not be negated and that
27 transition from the authorities and responsibilities granted by such
28 section to those granted by sections 46-713 to 46-719 should occur in as
29 efficient a manner as possible. Such transition shall be therefor
30 governed by subsections (2) through (5) of this section, and all
31 references in such subsections to section 46-656.28 shall be construed to
-247-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 mean section 46-656.28 as such section existed immediately prior to July
2 16, 2004.
3 (2) If, prior to July 16, 2004, (a) a natural resources district
4 requested pursuant to subsection (1) of section 46-656.28 that affected
5 appropriators, affected surface water project sponsors, and the
6 department consult and that studies and a hearing be held but (b) the
7 Director of Natural Resources, as such position existed, had has not made
8 a preliminary determination relative to that request pursuant to
9 subsection (2) of section 46-656.28, no further action on the district's
10 request shall be required of the department. If under the same
11 circumstances a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain water
12 wells has been imposed by the district pursuant to subsection (16) of
13 section 46-656.28 and remains in effect immediately prior to July 16,
14 2004, such temporary suspension shall remain in effect for thirty days
15 after the department issues its first annual report under section 46-713,
16 except that (i) such temporary suspension shall not apply to water wells
17 for which a permit has been obtained pursuant to the Municipal and Rural
18 Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act and (ii) to the extent any
19 such temporary suspension is in effect for all or part of a
20 hydrologically connected area for a river basin, subbasin, or reach
21 designated as overappropriated by the department, such temporary
22 suspension shall remain in effect only until it is superseded by the
23 stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section 46-714. To
24 the extent that any such temporary suspension applies to a geographic
25 area preliminarily considered by the department to have ground water
26 hydrologically connected to the surface water of a fully appropriated
27 river basin, subbasin, or reach, such temporary suspension shall be
28 superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of
29 section 46-714.
30 (3)(a) If prior to July 16, 2004, (i) the director has made a
31 preliminary determination pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28
-248-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 that there is reason to believe that the use of hydrologically connected
2 ground water and surface water in a specific geographic area is
3 contributing to or is in the reasonably foreseeable future likely to
4 contribute to any conflict, dispute, or difficulty listed in such
5 subsection, (ii) the director has not made a determination pursuant to
6 subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint action plan should not
7 be prepared, and (iii) preparation of a joint action plan pursuant to
8 subsections (5) through (9) of such section has not been completed, the
9 geographic area involved shall become subject to sections 46-713 to
10 46-719 on July 16, 2004, and the department need not evaluate such
11 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
12 46-713.
13 (b) For purposes of this subsection and section 46-714 and except as
14 otherwise provided in this section, (i) July 16, 2004, shall result in
15 the imposition in any geographic area subject to this subsection of the
16 stays required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714, (ii) such
17 stays shall be imposed in the manner required by such section, and (iii)
18 July 16, 2004, shall be treated as if it were the date of a departmental
19 preliminary determination pursuant to section 46-713 that such area is a
20 geographic area within which ground water and surface water of a fully
21 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach are hydrologically
22 connected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if a
23 temporary suspension in the drilling of certain new water wells has
24 previously been imposed by the affected natural resources district, (A)
25 the stays on construction of new water wells and on the increase in
26 ground water irrigated acres shall be limited in geographic extent to
27 only that part of the affected area within which the temporary suspension
28 was in effect unless the director determines that inclusion of additional
29 area is necessary because ground water and surface water are
30 hydrologically connected in such additional area and (B) the stays on
31 construction of certain new water wells shall not apply to a water well
-249-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 constructed in accordance with the terms of a water well construction
2 permit approved by the district prior to July 16, 2004, unless such well
3 was subject to the district's temporary suspension. If, prior to July 16,
4 2004, the director has held a hearing on a report issued pursuant to
5 subsection (3) of section 46-656.28 but has not yet determined whether a
6 joint action plan should be prepared, no departmental hearing shall be
7 required pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 before a final
8 determination is made about whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach
9 involved is fully appropriated. If, prior to July 16, 2004, the director
10 has determined pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a
11 joint action plan should be prepared, such determination shall have the
12 same effect as a final departmental determination pursuant to subsection
13 (5) of section 46-714 that the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach
14 is fully appropriated and no separate determination to that effect shall
15 be required. If, after July 16, 2004, the department determines that all
16 or part of the area subject to this subsection is in an overappropriated
17 river basin, subbasin, or reach, that portion of the area shall
18 thereafter be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Ground Water
19 Management and Protection Act applicable to an overappropriated river
20 basin, subbasin, or reach and stays that have previously taken effect in
21 accordance with this subsection shall continue in effect as stays for an
22 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach without additional
23 action or publication of notice by the department. Any temporary
24 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells that has been imposed
25 in the geographic area involved by a natural resources district pursuant
26 to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28 prior to July 16, 2004, shall
27 remain in effect until superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to

2 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
3 46-713. The department and the affected natural resources district shall
4 review the completed joint action plan for its compliance with sections
5 46-715 to 46-717. If the joint action plan is determined to be in
6 compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 or if agreement is reached on
7 the revisions necessary to bring it into such compliance, the department
8 and the district shall adopt the plan and implement the controls as
9 provided in section 46-718. If the joint action plan is determined not to
10 be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 and agreement on the
11 proposed plan or the proposed controls cannot be reached pursuant to
12 section 46-718, section 46-719 shall apply. Except to the extent that any
13 portion of the affected area is designated as all or part of an
14 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach, any temporary
15 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells imposed in the affected
16 geographic area by a natural resources district pursuant to subsection
17 (16) of section 46-656.28 shall remain in effect until (a) the department
18 and the affected district have jointly decided to implement the plan,
19 with or without modifications, and controls have been adopted and taken
20 effect or (b) the Interrelated Water Review Board, pursuant to section
21 46-719, has adopted an integrated management plan for the affected river
22 basin, subbasin, or reach and the controls adopted by the board have
23 taken effect. To the extent that any portion of the affected area is
24 designated as all or part of an overappropriated river basin, subbasin,
25 or reach, any temporary suspension in the drilling of water wells shall
26 be superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of
27 section 46-714.
28 (5) If, before July 16, 2004, a joint action plan has been adopted
29 and implemented pursuant to subsections (10) through (12) of section
30 46-656.28 and is in effect immediately prior to such date, the department

13 management area was designated.
14 (2) In adopting, amending, or repealing any control authorized by
15 subsection (1) of this section or sections 46-740 and 46-741, the
16 district's considerations shall include, but not be limited to, whether
17 it reasonably appears that such action will mitigate or eliminate the
18 condition which led to designation of the management area or will improve
19 the administration of the area.
20 (3) Upon request by the district or when any of the controls being
21 proposed are for the purpose of integrated management of hydrologically
22 connected ground water and surface water, the Chief Water Officer
23 Director of Natural Resources shall review and comment on the adoption,
24 amendment, or repeal of any authorized control in a management area. The
25 Chief Water Officer director may hold a public hearing to consider
26 testimony regarding the control prior to commenting on the adoption,

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 of this section.
2 (4) If because of varying ground water uses, varying surface water
3 uses, different irrigation distribution systems, or varying climatic,
4 hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions existing within a management
5 area the uniform application throughout such area of one or more controls
6 would fail to carry out the intent of the Nebraska Ground Water
7 Management and Protection Act in a reasonably effective and equitable
8 manner, the controls adopted by the district pursuant to this section may
9 contain different provisions for different categories of ground water use
10 or portions of the management area which differ from each other because
11 of varying climatic, hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions. Any
12 differences in such provisions shall recognize and be directed toward
13 such varying ground water uses or varying conditions. Except as otherwise
14 provided in this section, if the district adopts different controls for
15 different categories of ground water use, those controls shall be
16 consistent with section 46-613 and shall, for each such category, be
17 uniform for all portions of the area which have substantially similar
18 climatic, hydrologic, geologic, and soil conditions.
19 (5) The district may establish different water allocations for
20 different irrigation distribution systems.
21 (6)(a) The district may establish different provisions for different
22 hydrologic relationships between ground water and surface water.
23 (b) For management areas a purpose of which is the integrated
24 management of hydrologically connected ground water and surface water,
25 the district may establish different provisions for water wells either
26 permitted or constructed before the designation of a management area for
27 integrated management of hydrologically connected ground water and
28 surface water and for water wells either permitted or constructed on or
29 after the designation date or any other later date or dates established
30 by the district. Permits for construction of new wells not completed by
31 the date of the determination of fully appropriated shall be subject to
-263-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 any conditions imposed by the applicable natural resources district.
2 (c) For a management area in a river basin or part of a river basin
3 that is or was the subject of litigation over an interstate water compact
4 or decree in which the State of Nebraska is a named defendant, the
5 district may establish different provisions for restriction of water
6 wells constructed after January 1, 2001, if such litigation was commenced
7 before or on May 22, 2001. If such litigation is commenced after May 22,
8 2001, the district may establish different provisions for restriction of
9 water wells constructed after the date on which such litigation is
10 commenced in federal court. An appeal from a decision of the district
11 under this subdivision shall be in accordance with the hearing procedures

1 that an emergency exists involving a dam, the owner shall immediately
2 implement the emergency action plan as required pursuant to section
3 46-1647. The owner shall immediately notify any persons who may be
4 endangered if the dam should fail, notify emergency management
5 organizations in the area, take necessary remedial action to prevent or

7 department. The Chief Water Officer department shall take any remedial
8 action necessary to protect life and property if, in the Chief Water

28 safe or the emergency occasioning the action has ceased and the owner is
29 able to take back full charge and control. The Chief Water Officer's
30 department's taking full charge and control under this section does not
31 relieve the owner of such dam of liability for any negligent acts of such
-313-

LB317 LB317

30 58-202 (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
31 (a) The high cost of agricultural loans and the general
-334-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 unavailability of such loans at favorable rates and terms for farmers,
2 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises have
3 resulted in decreased crop, livestock, and business productivity and
4 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
5 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
6 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
7 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
8 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
9 citizens of this state; and
10 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
11 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
12 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
13 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
14 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
15 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
16 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
17 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
18 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
19 construction industry;
20 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
21 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
22 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
23 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
24 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
25 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
26 facilities; and
27 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
28 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
29 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
30 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
31 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
-335-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
2 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
3 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
4 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
5 food and shelter;
6 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
7 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
8 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
9 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
10 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
11 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
12 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
13 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
14 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
15 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
16 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
17 facilities to produce and supply energy;
18 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
19 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
20 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
21 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
22 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
23 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
24 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
25 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
26 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
27 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
28 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
29 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
30 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
31 suppliers.

1 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
2 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
3 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
4 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
5 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
6 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
7 and social liabilities to the entire state;
8 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
9 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
10 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
11 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
12 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
13 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
14 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
15 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
16 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
17 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
18 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
19 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
20 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
21 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
22 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
23 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
24 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
25 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
26 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
27 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
28 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
29 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
30 and protect the public health and welfare;
31 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
-337-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
2 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
3 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
4 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
5 needed within this state; and
6 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
7 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
8 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
9 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
10 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
11 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
12 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
13 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
14 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
15 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
16 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
17 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
18 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
19 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
20 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
21 safe drinking water facilities is great;
22 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
23 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
24 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
25 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
26 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
27 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
28 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
29 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
30 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
31 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
-338-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
2 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
3 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
4 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
5 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
6 and
7 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
8 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
9 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
10 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
11 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
12 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
13 section shall prohibit the provision of loans , including loans made
14 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act, to a municipality as
15 defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction, development,
16 rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of wastewater
17 treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.
18 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
19 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
20 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
21 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
22 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
23 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
24 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
25 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
26 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
27 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
28 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
29 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
30 educational benefits and services;
31 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
-339-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
2 and
3 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
4 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
5 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
6 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
7 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
8 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
9 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
10 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
11 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
12 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
13 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
14 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
15 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
16 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
17 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
18 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
19 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
20 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
21 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
22 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
23 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
24 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
25 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
26 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
27 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
28 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
29 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
30 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
31 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
-340-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
2 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
3 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
4 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
5 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
6 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
7 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
8 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
9 public health and welfare;
10 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
11 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
12 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
13 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
14 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
15 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
16 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
17 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the
18 financing of solid waste disposal areas and facilities and in the removal
19 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
20 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
21 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
22 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
23 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
24 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save
25 lives, to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
26 (b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for
27 use by Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska
28 Public Safety Communication System Act;
29 (c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
30 required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies.
31 Since the maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the
-341-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 cost of purchasing and operating multiple communication infrastructures
2 is prohibitive, it is imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in
3 their efforts to obtain real and personal property to establish, operate,
4 maintain, and manage public safety communication systems; and
5 (d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
6 political subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal
7 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition,
8 construction, and operation of real and personal property of public
9 safety communication systems.
10 (9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27,
11 2005, and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects,
12 there is a need to increase both the limit on individual net worth and
13 the limit on the aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the
14 authority. Such adjustments are necessary to address the inadequate
15 supply of and pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan
16 financing at interest rates and terms that are consistent with the needs
17 of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural
18 enterprises.
19 (10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
20 (a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy
21 the problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
22 insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
23 powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
24 funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal
25 sources;
26 (b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance
27 Authority Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies
28 and private entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such
29 public-private and intergovernmental cooperation; and
30 (c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made
31 available to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of

2 2024, is amended to read:
3 66-1344 (1) Beginning June 1, 2000, during such period as funds
4 remain in the Ethanol Production Incentive Cash Fund, any ethanol
5 facility shall receive a credit of seven and one-half cents per gallon of
6 ethanol, before denaturing, for new production for a period not to exceed
7 thirty-six consecutive months. For purposes of this subsection, new
8 production means production which results from the expansion of an
9 existing facility's capacity by at least two million gallons first placed
10 into service after June 1, 1999, as certified by the facility's design
11 engineer to the Department of Revenue. For expansion of an existing
12 facility's capacity, new production means production in excess of the
13 average of the highest three months of ethanol production at an ethanol
14 facility during the twenty-four-month period immediately preceding
15 certification of the facility by the design engineer. No credits shall be
16 allowed under this subsection for expansion of an existing facility's
17 capacity until production is in excess of twelve times the three-month
18 average amount determined under this subsection during any twelve-
19 consecutive-month period beginning no sooner than June 1, 2000. New
20 production shall be approved by the Department of Revenue based on such
21 ethanol production records as may be necessary to reasonably determine
22 new production. This credit must be earned on or before December 31,
23 2003.
24 (2)(a) Beginning January 1, 2002, any new ethanol facility which is
25 in production at the minimum rate of one hundred thousand gallons
26 annually for the production of ethanol, before denaturing, and which has
27 provided to the Department of Revenue written evidence substantiating
28 that the ethanol facility has received the requisite authority from the
29 Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy and
30 from the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
31 Firearms and Explosives, on or before June 30, 2004, shall receive a
-381-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 credit of eighteen cents per gallon of ethanol produced for ninety-six
2 consecutive months beginning with the first calendar month for which it
3 is eligible to receive such credit and ending not later than June 30,
4 2012, if the facility is defined by subdivision (b)(i) of this
5 subsection, and for forty-eight consecutive months beginning with the
6 first calendar month for which it is eligible to receive such credit and
7 ending not later than June 30, 2008, if the facility is defined by
8 subdivision (b)(ii) of this subsection. The new ethanol facility shall
9 provide an analysis to the Department of Revenue of samples of the
10 product collected according to procedures specified by the department no
11 later than July 30, 2004, and at least annually thereafter. The analysis
12 shall be prepared by an independent laboratory meeting the International
13 Organization for Standardization standard ISO/IEC 17025:1999. Prior to
14 collecting the samples, the new ethanol facility shall notify the
15 department which may observe the sampling procedures utilized by the new
16 ethanol facility to obtain the samples to be submitted for independent
17 analysis. The minimum rate shall be established for a period of at least
18 thirty days. In this regard, the new ethanol facility must produce at
19 least eight thousand two hundred nineteen gallons of ethanol within a
20 thirty-day period. The ethanol must be finished product which is ready
21 for sale to customers.
22 (b) For purposes of this subsection, new ethanol facility means a
23 facility for the conversion of grain or other raw feedstock into ethanol
24 and other byproducts of ethanol production which (i) is not in production
25 on or before September 1, 2001, or (ii) has not received credits prior to
26 June 1, 1999. A new ethanol facility does not mean an expansion of an
27 existing ethanol plant that does not result in the physical construction
28 of an entire ethanol processing facility or which shares or uses in a
29 significant manner any existing plant's systems or processes and does not
30 include the expansion of production capacity constructed after June 30,
31 2004, of a plant qualifying for credits under this subsection. This

12 ethanol produced for or sold for use in the production of beverage
13 alcohol. Not more than ten million gallons of ethanol produced during any
14 twelve-consecutive-month period at an ethanol facility shall be eligible
15 for the credit described in subsection (1) of this section. The credits
16 described in this section shall be in the form of a nonrefundable,
17 transferable motor vehicle fuel tax credit certificate. No transfer of

21 be measured by a device approved by the Division of Weights and Measures
22 of the Department of Agriculture. Confirmation of approval by the
23 division shall be provided by the ethanol facility at the time the
24 initial claim for credits provided under this section is submitted to the
25 Department of Revenue and annually thereafter. Claims submitted by the
26 ethanol producer shall be based on the total number of gallons of ethanol
27 produced, before denaturing, during the reporting period measured in
28 gross gallons.
29 (5) The Department of Revenue shall prescribe an application form
30 and procedures for claiming credits under this section. In order for a

10 filed with the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol,
11 Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The maintenance of all of this
12 information in a provable computer format or on microfilm is acceptable
13 in lieu of retention of the original documents. The records must be
14 retained for a period of not less than three years after the claim for
15 ethanol credits is filed.
16 (7) For purposes of ascertaining the correctness of any application
17 for claiming a credit provided in this section, the Tax Commissioner (a)
18 may examine or cause to have examined, by any agent or representative
19 designated by him or her for that purpose, any books, papers, records, or
20 memoranda bearing upon such matters, (b) may by summons require the
21 attendance of the person responsible for rendering the application or
22 other document or any officer or employee of such person or the
23 attendance of any other person having knowledge in the premises, and (c)
24 may take testimony and require proof material for his or her information,
25 with power to administer oaths or affirmations to such person or persons.

29 is amended to read:
30 81-15,118 The Legislature finds that the number of leaking
31 underground storage tanks throughout the state is increasing and that
-456-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 there exists a serious threat to the health and safety of citizens
2 because substances contained in leaking storage tanks are often potential
3 ground water contaminants and major fire and explosive hazards.
4 For the reasons stated in this section, the Legislature deems it
5 necessary to provide a program of storage tank registration and
6 inspection as a preventative measure and a comprehensive leak cleanup
7 program as a responsive measure. Primary responsibility for the Petroleum
8 Products and Hazardous Substances Storage and Handling Act shall be with
9 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy.

19 department shall inform the owner or operator of its approval or
20 disapproval of a plan for remedial action within one hundred twenty days
21 after receipt of a remedial action plan which contains all required
22 information. If after one hundred twenty days the department fails to
23 either deny, approve, or amend the remedial action plan submitted, the
24 proposed plan shall be deemed approved; and
25 (3) The approved remedial action plan shall then be carried out by
26 the owner or operator of the tank causing the release. All expenses
27 incurred during the remedial action shall be paid by the owner or
28 operator subject to reimbursement pursuant to the Petroleum Release
29 Remedial Action Act.
30 If it is determined that the source of the release is unknown or
31 that the owner or operator of the facility causing the release is unknown

7 real estate records of the county in which the remedial action took
8 place. The responsible person shall file the certificate of completion

16 action with regard to the release of a petroleum product for which the
17 responsible person has complied with the requirements of this subsection.

23 if any, upon which the certificate of completion is conditioned.
24 (2) A certificate of completion issued by the department under
25 subsection (1) of this section shall require the responsible person to
26 conduct additional remedial action in the event that any monitoring
27 conducted at or near the real property or other circumstances indicate
28 that (a) contamination is reoccurring, (b) additional contamination is
29 present for which remedial action was not taken according to the remedial
30 action plan, or (c) contamination from the site presents a threat to
31 human health or the environment and was not addressed in the remedial
-460-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 action plan.
2 (3) A certificate of completion shall be revoked if the department
3 demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that any approval
4 provided under this section was obtained by fraud or material
5 misrepresentation, knowing failure to disclose material information, or
6 false certification to the department. The department shall file a copy
7 of the notice of revocation of any certificate of completion in the real
8 estate records of the county in which the remedial action took place
9 within ten days after such revocation.
10 (4) If a responsible person transfers property to an affiliate in
11 order for that affiliate to obtain a benefit to which the transferor
12 would not otherwise be eligible under this section or to avoid an
13 obligation under this section, the affiliate shall be subject to the same
14 obligations and obtain the same level of benefits as those available to
15 the transferor under this section.
16 (5)(a) A covenant not to sue arising under subsection (1) of this
17 section, unless voided pursuant to such subsection, shall bar suit
18 against any person who acquires title to property to which a certificate
19 of completion applies for all claims of the state or any other person in
20 connection with petroleum products which were the subject of an approved
21 remedial action plan and (b) a person who purchased a site before May 31,
22 2001, is released, upon the issuance of a certificate of completion under
23 this section or upon the issuance of a no further action letter on or
24 after May 31, 2001, pursuant to section 81-15,186, from all liability to
25 the state for cleanup of contamination that was released at the site
26 covered by the certificate of completion or the no further action letter
27 before the purchase date, except as provided in subsection (4) of this
28 section, for releases or consequences that the person contributed to or
29 caused, for failure by such person to comply with the monitoring,
30 institutional, or technological controls, if any, upon which the
31 certificate of completion is conditioned, or in the event the certificate
-461-

LB317 LB317
2025 2025
1 of completion is revoked by the department under subsection (3) of this
2 section.
3 (6) Any person entitled to the protections of the covenant not to
4 sue or eligible to be released from liability pursuant to the issuance of
5 a certificate of completion or a no further action letter under
6 subsection (5) of this section who is ordered by the department to take
7 remedial action shall be eligible for reimbursement as a responsible
8 person pursuant to section 66-1525 and shall not be required to pay the
9 first cost or percent of the remaining cost as provided in subsection (1)
10 of section 66-1523 unless such person contributed to or caused the
11 release or failed to comply with the monitoring, institutional, or
12 technological controls, if any, imposed under subsection (1) of this
13 section.
