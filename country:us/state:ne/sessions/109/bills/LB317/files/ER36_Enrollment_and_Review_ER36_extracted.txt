16 Sec. 28. Section 2-3254, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
17 amended to read:
18 2-3254 (1) The board shall hold a hearing upon the question of the
19 desirability and necessity, in the interest of the public health, safety,

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 consultation with such appropriate agencies of state and federal
2 government and after the hearing, that the project conforms with all
3 applicable law and with the district's goals, criteria, and policies, it
4 shall enter its findings in the board's official records and shall, with
5 the aid of such engineers, surveyors, and other assistants as it may have
6 chosen, establish an improvement project area or alter the boundaries of
7 an existing improvement project area, proceed to make detailed plans and
8 cost estimates, determine the total benefits, and carry out the project
9 as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. If the board
10 finds that the project does not so conform, the findings shall be entered
11 in the board's records and copies of such findings shall be furnished to
12 the petitioners and the commission.
13 (2) When any such special project would result in the provision of
14 revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall, prior to
15 commencement of construction of such project, determine, by circulation
16 of petitions or by some other appropriate method, if such project can be
17 reasonably expected to generate sufficient revenue to recover the
18 reimbursable costs thereof. If it is determined that the project cannot
19 be reasonably expected to generate sufficient revenue, the project and
20 all work in connection therewith shall be suspended. If it is determined
21 that the project can be reasonably expected to generate sufficient
22 revenue, the board shall divide the total benefits of the project as
23 provided in sections 2-3252 to 2-3254. If the proposed project involves

30 Environment and Energy rather than the Director of Natural Resources. No
31 construction of any such special project shall begin until the plans and
-36-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 specifications for such improvement have been approved by the Chief Water
2 Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment. When such a
3 special project involves a public water system as defined in section
4 71-5301, the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment shall Director of
5 Natural Resources and the Department of Environment and Energy, if
6 applicable, except that if such special project involves a public water
7 system as defined in section 71-5301, only the Department of Environment
8 and Energy shall be required to review such plans and specifications and
9 approve the same if in compliance with the Nebraska Safe Drinking Water
10 Act and departmental rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under
11 the act. All prescribed conditions having been complied with, each
12 landowner within the improvement project area shall, within any limits
13 otherwise prescribed by law, subscribe to a number of benefit units in
14 proportion to the extent he or she desires to participate in the benefits
15 of the special project. As long as the capacity of the district's
16 facilities permit, participating landowners may subscribe to additional
17 units, within any limits otherwise prescribed by law, upon payment of a
18 unit fee for each such unit. The unit fees made and charged pursuant to
19 this section shall be levied and fixed by rules and regulations of the
20 district. The service provided may be withheld during the time such
21 charges levied upon such parcel of land are delinquent and unpaid. Such
22 charges shall be cumulative, and the service provided by the project may
23 be withheld until all delinquent charges for the operation and
24 maintenance of such works of improvement are paid for past years as well
25 as for the current year. All such charges, due and delinquent according
26 to the rules and regulations of such district and unpaid on June 1 after
27 becoming due and delinquent, may be certified by the governing authority
28 of such district to the county clerk of such county in which are situated
29 the lands against which such charges have been levied, and when so
30 certified such charges shall be entered upon the tax list and spread upon
31 the tax roll the same as other special assessment taxes are levied and
-37-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 assessed upon real estate, shall become a lien upon such real estate
2 along with other real estate taxes, and shall be collectible at the same
3 time, in the same manner, and in the same proceeding as other real estate
4 taxes are levied.
5 (3) When the special project would not result in the provision of
6 revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall apportion the
7 benefits thereof accruing to the several tracts of land within the
8 district which will be benefited thereby, on a system of units. The land
9 least benefited shall be apportioned one unit of assessment, and each
10 tract receiving a greater benefit shall be apportioned a greater number
11 of units or fraction thereof, according to the benefits received. Nothing
12 contained in this section shall prevent the district from establishing
13 separate areas within the improvement project area so as to permit future
14 allocation of costs for particular portions of the work to specific
15 subareas. This subarea method of allocation shall not be used in any
16 improvement project area which has heretofore made a final apportionment
17 of units of benefits and shall not thereafter be changed except by
18 compliance with the procedure prescribed in this section.
19 (4) A notice shall be inserted for at least one week in a newspaper
20 published or of general circulation in the improvement project area
21 stating the time when and the place where the directors shall meet for
22 the purpose of hearing all parties interested in the apportionment of
23 benefits by reason of the improvement, at which time and place such
24 parties may appear in person or by counsel or may file written objections
25 thereto. The directors shall then proceed to hear and consider the same
26 and shall make the apportionments fair and just according to benefits
27 received from the improvement. The directors, having completed the
28 apportionment of benefits, shall make a detailed report of the same and
29 file such report with the county clerk. The board of directors shall
30 include in such report a statement of the actual expenses incurred by the
31 district to that time which relate to the proposed project and the actual
-38-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 cost per benefit unit thereof. Thereupon the board of directors shall
2 cause to be published, once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
3 newspaper published or of general circulation in the improvement project
4 area, a notice that the report required in this subsection has been filed
5 and notice shall also be sent to each party appearing to have a direct
6 legal interest in such apportionment, which notice shall include the
7 description of the lands in which each party notified appears to have
8 such interest, the units of benefit assigned to such lands, the amount of
9 actual costs assessable to date to such lands, and the estimated total
10 costs of the project assessable to such lands upon completion thereof, as
11 provided by sections 25-520.01 to 25-520.03. If the owners of record
12 title representing more than fifty percent of the estimated total
13 assessments file with the board within thirty days of the final
14 publication of such notice written objections to the project proposed,
15 such project and work in connection therewith shall be suspended, such
16 project shall not be done in such project area, and all expenses relating
17 to such project incurred by and accrued to the district may, at the
18 direction of the board of directors, be assessed upon the lands which
19 were to have been benefited by the completion of such improvement project
20 in accordance with the apportionment of benefits determined and
21 procedures established in this section. Upon completing the establishment
22 of an improvement project area or altering the boundaries of an existing
23 improvement project area as provided in this subsection and upon
24 determining the reimbursable cost of the project and the period of time
25 over which such cost shall be assessed, the board of directors shall
26 determine the amount of money necessary to raise each year by special
27 assessment within such improvement project area and apportion the same in
28 dollars and cents to each tract benefited according to the apportionment
29 of benefits as determined by this section. The board of directors shall
30 also, from time to time as it deems necessary, order an additional
31 assessment upon the lands and property benefited by the project, using
-39-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 the original apportionment of benefits as a basis to ascertain the
2 assessment to each tract of land benefited, to carry out a reasonable
3 program of operation and maintenance upon the construction or capital
4 improvements involved in such project. The chairperson and secretary
5 shall thereupon return lists of such tracts with the amounts chargeable
6 to each of the county clerks of each county in which assessed lands are
7 located, who shall place the same on duplicate tax lists against the
8 lands and lots so assessed. Such assessments shall be collected and
9 accounted for by the county treasurer at the same time as general real
10 estate taxes, and such assessments shall be and remain a perpetual lien
11 against such real estate until paid. All provisions of law for the sale,
12 redemption, and foreclosure in ordinary tax matters shall apply to such
13 special assessments.
14 Sec. 29. Section 2-3279, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 2-3279 All plans submitted by a district under section sections
17 2-3276 to 2-3278, except those filed in compliance with state
18 requirements or for the purpose of state financial assistance, shall be
19 accorded a thirty-day period for review and comment. Failure to reply
20 within thirty days shall be conclusive that the plans have been endorsed
21 by the reviewing agency. All comments on plans shall be reviewed by the
22 district and alterations of the plans may be made as the district deems
23 appropriate. If any state agency comments indicate a lack of conformance
24 with the goals, criteria, and policies of any outdoor recreation plan,
25 any fish and wildlife plan, or indicate a conflict with state policies or
26 plans approved by the Legislature, such plans shall be altered as deemed
27 necessary by the district prior to proceeding with implementation.
28 Sec. 30. Section 2-3280, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 2-3280 No state funds shall be allocated or disbursed to a district
31 unless that district has submitted its master plan in accordance with

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 sections 2-3229 and 2-3276 to 2-3280 and until the disbursing agency has

3 which are in conformance with the plans of the agency.
4 Sec. 31. Section 2-4602, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 2-4602 The Legislature recognizes that erosion and sedimentation are
7 serious problems throughout the state. Changes in farm and ranch
8 enterprises, operations, and ownership, demands made upon farm and ranch
9 enterprises which do not encourage sound resource utilization, rapid
10 shifts in land use from agricultural and rural to nonagricultural and
11 urban uses, construction of streets, highways, pipelines, recreation
12 areas, schools and universities, public utilities and facilities,
13 conversion of grasslands to croplands, and other land-disturbing
14 activities have caused excessive wind erosion and water runoff and
15 accelerated the process of soil erosion and sediment deposition. This has
16 resulted in the pollution of the waters of the state and damage to
17 domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, fish and wildlife, and
18 other resources. It is declared to be the policy of the state to
19 strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities
20 and programs of the state for both rural and urban lands, to improve
21 water quality, and to establish and implement, through the Director of
22 Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources and the Nebraska Natural
23 Resources Commission, a statewide, comprehensive, and coordinated erosion
24 and sediment control program to reduce damage from wind erosion and storm
25 water runoff, to retard nonpoint pollution from sediment and related
26 pollutants, and to conserve and protect land, air, and other resources of
27 the state. This program shall be carried out by the natural resources
28 districts in cooperation with the counties, municipalities, and other
29 local governments and political subdivisions of the state and other
30 public and private entities.

2 distributed for irrigation purposes shall attach to and follow the tract
3 of land to which it is applied unless a change of location has been

7 (2) The board of directors may by the adoption of appropriate bylaws
8 provide for the suspension of water delivery to any land in such district
9 upon which the irrigation taxes levied and assessed thereon shall remain
10 due and unpaid for two years. It shall be the duty of the directors to
11 make all necessary arrangements for right-of-way for laterals from the

28 the absence of sufficient cause for such nonuse. Such notification shall
29 indicate the reason or reasons the owner is contesting the Chief Water
30 Officer's department's preliminary determination and include any
31 information the owner believes is relevant to the issues of nonuse or

1 sufficient cause for such nonuse.
2 (2) If no owner of the appropriation or of the land under the
3 appropriation provides notification to the Chief Water Officer department
4 in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the Chief Water
5 Officer director may issue an order canceling the appropriation in whole
6 or in part. The extent of such cancellation shall not exceed the extent
7 described in the Chief Water Officer's department's notice to the owner
8 or owners in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. A copy of
9 the order canceling the appropriation, or part thereof, shall be posted
10 on the department's website and shall be provided to the owner or owners
11 of the appropriation and to any other owner of the land under the
12 appropriation in the same manner that notices are to be given in
13 accordance with subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03, as
14 applicable. No cancellation under this subsection shall prohibit an
15 irrigation district, a reclamation district, a public power and
16 irrigation district, or a mutual irrigation company or canal company from
17 asserting the rights provided by subsections (5) and (6) of section
18 46-229.04.
19 (3) If an owner of the appropriation provides notification to the
20 Chief Water Officer department in accordance with subsection (1) of this
21 section, the Chief Water Officer department shall review the owner's
22 stated reasons for contesting the Chief Water Officer's department's
23 preliminary determination and any other information provided with the
24 owner's notice. If the Chief Water Officer department determines that the
25 owner has provided sufficient information for the Chief Water Officer
26 department to conclude that the appropriation should not be canceled, in
27 whole or in part, the Chief Water Officer it shall inform the owners of
28 the appropriation, and any other owners of the land under the
29 appropriation, of such determination.
30 (4) If the Chief Water Officer department determines that an owner
31 has provided sufficient information to support the conclusion that the
-84-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 appropriation should be canceled only in part and if (a) the owner or
2 owners filing the notice of contest agree in writing to such cancellation
3 in part and (b) such owner or owners are the only known owners of the
4 appropriation and of the land under the appropriation, the Chief Water
5 Officer director may issue an order canceling the appropriation to the
6 extent agreed to by the owner or owners and shall provide a copy of such
7 order to such owner or owners.
8 (5) If the Chief Water Officer department determines that
9 subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section do not apply, the Chief
10 Water Officer it shall schedule and conduct a hearing on the cancellation
11 of the appropriation in whole or in part. Notice of the hearing shall be
12 provided to the owner or owners who filed notices with the Chief Water
13 Officer department pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, to any
14 other owner of the appropriation known to the Chief Water Officer
15 department, and to any other owner of the land under the appropriation.
16 The notice shall be posted on the department's website and shall be
17 served or published, as applicable, in the manner provided in subsection
18 (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03, as applicable.
19 (6) Following a hearing conducted in accordance with subsection (5)
20 of this section and subsection (1) of section 46-229.04, the Chief Water
21 Officer director shall render a decision by order. A copy of the order
22 shall be provided to the owner or owners of the appropriation and to any
23 other person who is an owner of the land under the appropriation. The
24 copy of the order shall be posted on the department's website and shall
25 be served or published, as applicable, in the same manner that notices
26 are to be given in accordance with subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section
27 46-229.03, as applicable, except that if publication is required, it
28 shall be sufficient for the Chief Water Officer department to publish
29 notice that an order has been issued. Any such published notice shall
30 identify the land or lands involved and shall provide the address and
31 telephone number that may be used to obtain a copy of the order.

2 the terms of the permit may be canceled by the Chief Water Officer
3 department without complying with sections 46-229.01 to 46-229.04 if the
4 owner of such appropriation fails to comply with any of the conditions of
5 approval in the permit, except that this subsection does not apply to

2 (2) For any owner whose name and address are known to the Chief
3 Water Officer department or can be reasonably obtained by the Chief Water
4 Officer department, the notice shall be served by personal service or by
5 registered mail or certified mail. Any landowner's name or address shall
6 be considered reasonably obtainable if that person is listed as an owner
7 of the land involved, on the records of the county clerk or register of
8 deeds for the county in which the land is located.
9 (3) For any owner whose name and address are not known to the Chief
10 Water Officer department and cannot reasonably be obtained by the Chief

12 legal newspaper published or of general circulation in any county in
13 which the place of diversion is located and in a legal newspaper
14 published or of general circulation in each county containing land for
15 which the right to use water under the appropriation is subject to
16 cancellation. Each such publication shall be once each week for three
17 consecutive weeks.
18 (4) Landowners whose property under such appropriation is located
19 within the corporate limits of a city or village shall be served by the

23 Sec. 80. Section 46-229.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-229.04 (1) At a hearing held pursuant to section 46-229.03, the
26 verified field investigation report of an employee of the department, or
27 such other report or information that is relied upon by the Chief Water
28 Officer department to reach the preliminary determination of nonuse,
29 shall be prima facie evidence for the forfeiture and annulment of such
30 water appropriation. If no person appears at the hearing, such water
31 appropriation or unused part thereof shall be declared forfeited and
-87-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 annulled. If an interested person appears and contests the same, the
2 Chief Water Officer department shall hear evidence, and if it appears
3 that such water has not been put to a beneficial use or has ceased to be
4 used for such purpose for more than five consecutive years, the same
5 shall be declared canceled and annulled unless the Chief Water Officer
6 department finds that (a) there has been sufficient cause for such nonuse
7 as provided for in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of this section or (b)
8 subsection (5) or (6) of this section applies.
9 (2) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
10 thirty consecutive years if:
11 (a) Such nonuse was caused by the unavailability of water for that
12 use. For a river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been designated as
13 overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined by the Chief
14 Water Officer department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section
15 46-714, the period of time within which sufficient cause for nonuse
16 because of the unavailability of water may be deemed to exist may be
17 extended beyond thirty years by the Chief Water Officer department upon
18 petition therefor by the owner of the appropriation if the Chief Water
19 Officer department determines that an integrated management plan being
20 implemented in the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved is likely to
21 result in restoration of a usable water supply for the appropriation; or
22 (b) The land subject to the appropriation is under an acreage
23 reserve program or production quota or is otherwise withdrawn from use as
24 required for participation in any federal, state, or natural resources
25 district program, or such land was previously under such a program but
26 currently is not under such a program and there have been not more than
27 five consecutive years of nonuse on such land subsequent to when that
28 land was last under such program.
29 (3) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist
30 indefinitely if such nonuse was the result of one or more of the
31 following:
-88-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (a) For any tract of land under separate ownership, the available
2 supply was used but on only part of the land under the appropriation
3 because of an inadequate water supply;
4 (b) The appropriation is a storage appropriation and there was an
5 inadequate water supply to provide the water for the storage
6 appropriation or less than the full amount of the storage appropriation
7 was needed to keep the reservoir full; or
8 (c) The appropriation is a storage-use appropriation and there was
9 an inadequate water supply to provide the water for the appropriation or
10 use of the storage water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions.
11 (4) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
12 fifteen consecutive years if such nonuse was a result of one or more of
13 the following:
14 (a) Federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations temporarily
15 prevented or restricted such use;
16 (b) Use of the water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions;
17 (c) Circumstances were such that a prudent person, following the
18 principles of good husbandry, would not have been expected to use the
19 water;
20 (d) The works, diversions, or other facilities essential to use the
21 water were destroyed by a cause not within the control of the owner of
22 the appropriation and good faith efforts to repair or replace the works,
23 diversions, or facilities have been and are being made;
24 (e) The owner of the appropriation was in active involuntary service
25 in the armed forces of the United States or was in active voluntary
26 service during a time of crisis; or
27 (f) Legal proceedings prevented or restricted use of the water.
28 The Chief Water Officer department may specify by rule and
29 regulation other circumstances that shall be deemed to constitute
30 sufficient cause for nonuse for up to fifteen years.
31 (5) When an appropriation is held in the name of an irrigation
-89-

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 district, a reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district,
2 a mutual irrigation company or canal company, or the United States Bureau
3 of Reclamation and the Chief Water Officer director determines that water
4 under that appropriation has not been used on a specific parcel of land
5 for more than five years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse
6 exists, the right to use water under that appropriation on that parcel
7 shall be terminated and notice of the termination shall be posted on the
8 department's website and shall be given in the manner provided in
9 subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The district or company
10 holding such right shall have five years after the determination, or five
11 years after an order of cancellation issued by the Chief Water Officer
12 department following the filing of a voluntary relinquishment of the
13 water appropriation that has been signed by the landowner and the
14 appropriator of record, to assign the right to use that portion of the
15 appropriation to other land within the district or the area served by the
16 company, to file an application for a transfer in accordance with section
17 46-290, or to transfer the right in accordance with sections 46-2,127 to
18 46-2,129. The Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its order of
19 cancellation within sixty days after receipt of the voluntary
20 relinquishment unless the relinquishment is conditioned by the landowner
21 upon an action of a governmental agency. If the relinquishment contains
22 such a provision, the Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its
23 order of cancellation within sixty days after receipt of notification
24 that such action has been completed. The Chief Water Officer department
25 shall be notified of any such assignment within thirty days after such
26 assignment. If the district or company does not assign the right to use
27 that portion of the appropriation to other land, does not file an
28 application for a transfer within the five-year period, or does not
29 notify the Chief Water Officer department within thirty days after any
30 such assignment, that portion of the appropriation shall be canceled
31 without further proceedings by the Chief Water Officer department and the
-90-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 district or company involved shall be so notified by the Chief Water
2 Officer department. During the time within which assignment of a portion
3 of an appropriation is pending, the allowable diversion rate for the
4 appropriation involved shall be reduced, as necessary, to avoid
5 inconsistency with the rate allowed by section 46-231 or with any greater
6 rate previously approved for such appropriation by the Chief Water
7 Officer director in accordance with section 46-229.06.
8 (6) When it is determined by the Chief Water Officer director that
9 an appropriation, for which the location of use has been temporarily
10 transferred in accordance with sections 46-290 to 46-294, has not been
11 used at the new location for more than five years and that no sufficient
12 cause for such nonuse exists, the right to use that appropriation at the
13 temporary location of use shall be terminated. Notice of that termination
14 shall be posted on the department's website and shall be given in the
15 manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The
16 right to reinitiate use of that appropriation at the location of use
17 prior to the temporary transfer shall continue to exist for five years
18 after the Chief Water Officer's director's determination, but if such use
19 is not reinitiated at that location within such five-year period, the
20 appropriation shall be subject to cancellation in accordance with
21 sections 46-229 to 46-229.04.
22 (7) If at the time of a hearing conducted in accordance with
23 subsection (1) of this section there is an application for incidental or
24 intentional underground water storage pending before the Chief Water
25 Officer department and filed by the owner of the appropriation, the
26 proceedings shall be consolidated.
27 Sec. 81. Section 46-229.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-229.05 An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Chief
30 Water Officer department upon such hearing as provided by section 61-207.
31 Sec. 82. Section 46-229.06, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
-91-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 amended to read:
2 46-229.06 When a departmental proceeding that is conducted pursuant
3 to sections 46-229 to 46-229.04 concerns the partial cancellation of an
4 appropriation, the Chief Water Officer department may receive evidence on
5 the question of whether, following such partial cancellation, a reduction
6 in the rate of diversion to the maximum rate prescribed in section 46-231
7 would result in an authorized diversion rate less than the rate
8 necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of
9 crops on the lands that remain subject to the appropriation. If the Chief
10 Water Officer director determines, based on a preponderance of the
11 evidence, that such rate would be less than the rate necessary, in the
12 interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops, he or she may
13 approve a diversion rate for the remaining portion of the appropriation
14 greater than the maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such
15 increased rate can be no greater than the rate authorized for the
16 appropriation prior to the partial cancellation and no greater than the
17 rate determined by the Chief Water Officer director to be necessary, in
18 the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands
19 that remain subject to the appropriation.
20 Sec. 83. Section 46-230, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-230 (1) As the adjudication of a stream progresses and as each
23 claim is finally adjudicated, the Chief Water Officer director shall make
24 and cause to be entered of record in his or her office an order
25 determining and establishing the priorities of right to use the water of
26 such stream, the amount of the appropriation of the persons claiming
27 water from such stream and the character of use for which each
28 appropriation is found to have been made, and the address of the owner of
29 each water appropriation.
30 (2) Whenever requested by the Chief Water Officer department, the
31 owner of any appropriation not held by an irrigation district,
-92-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
2 irrigation or canal company shall provide the Chief Water Officer
3 department with the name, address, and telephone number of each then-
4 current owner of the appropriation and with the name, address, and
5 telephone number of any tenant or other person who is authorized by the
6 owner to receive opening and closing notices and other departmental
7 communications relating to the appropriation. Each appropriation owner
8 shall also notify the Chief Water Officer department any time there is a
9 change in any of such names, addresses, or telephone numbers. Notice of
10 ownership changes may be provided to the Chief Water Officer department
11 in the manner provided in section 76-2,124 or in any other manner
12 authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. If notice of an
13 ownership change is provided other than in accordance with such section,
14 the notice shall include such evidence of ownership as the Chief Water
15 Officer director may require. Notice of all other changes may be provided
16 in any manner authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. Upon
17 receipt of any new information, the Chief Water Officer department shall
18 update the Chief Water Officer's its records. The Chief Water Officer
19 department shall not collect a fee for the filing of any such information
20 or for updating the Chief Water Officer's its records.
21 Sec. 84. Section 46-231, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-231 Each appropriation shall be determined in its priority and
24 amount by the time at which it is made and the amount of water which the
25 works are constructed to carry. An appropriator shall at no time be
26 entitled to the use of more than he or she can beneficially use for the
27 purposes for which the appropriation has been made, and the amount of any
28 appropriation made by means of enlargement of the distributing works
29 shall be determined in like manner.
30 An allotment from the natural flow of streams for irrigation shall
31 not exceed one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of
-93-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 land and shall not exceed three acre-feet in the aggregate during one
2 calendar year for each acre of land for which such appropriation has been
3 made, and an allotment shall not exceed the least amount of water that
4 experience may indicate is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry,
5 for the production of crops. Such limitations do not apply to storage
6 waters or to water appropriations transferred pursuant to sections
7 46-2,122 to 46-2,125 and 46-2,127 to 46-2,129.
8 When storage water is being used in addition to the natural flow,
9 the person in charge of the ditch or canal shall, upon his or her request
10 and within twenty-four hours thereof, be notified in writing by the user
11 of such storage waters of the time of withdrawal from natural streams to
12 be distributed according to law.
13 When an appropriation is for irrigation purposes and the amount is
14 so small that a proper distribution and application is impractical, as
15 much water as the applicant can use without waste may be allotted for a
16 limited time so fixed by the Chief Water Officer department as to give
17 each appropriator his or her just share without violating other rights,
18 so long as (1) the volume of water used in a twenty-four-hour period does
19 not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been allowed at
20 the approved fixed continuous rate for a twenty-four-hour period or (2)
21 the volume of water used in a seven-day, Monday-through-Sunday period
22 does not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been
23 allowed at the approved fixed continuous rate for a seven-day period. The
24 Chief Water Officer department shall determine schedules among
25 appropriators to assure that other rights are not violated.
26 Sec. 85. Section 46-233, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
27 amended to read:
28 46-233 (1) The United States and every person intending to
29 appropriate any of the public waters of the State of Nebraska shall,
30 before (a) commencing the construction, enlargement, or extension of any
31 works for such purpose, (b) performing any work in connection with such

1 construction, enlargement, or extension, or (c) taking any water from any
2 constructed works, make an application to the Chief Water Officer
3 department for a permit to make such appropriation. A permit may be
4 obtained to appropriate public waters for intentional underground water
5 storage and recovery of such water. A public water supplier may make
6 application to appropriate public waters for induced ground water
7 recharge.
8 (2) The application shall be upon a form prescribed and furnished by
9 the Chief Water Officer department without cost to an applicant. Such
10 application shall set forth (a) the name and post office address of the
11 applicant, (b) the source from which such appropriation shall be made,
12 (c) the amount of the appropriation desired, as nearly as it may be
13 estimated, (d) the location of any proposed work in connection with the
14 appropriation, (e) the estimated time required for its completion, which
15 estimated time shall include the period required for the construction of
16 ditches, pumps, and other features or devices, (f) the time estimated at
17 which the application of the water for the beneficial purposes shall be
18 made, which time shall be limited to a reasonable time following the
19 estimated time of completion of the work when prosecuted with diligence,
20 (g) the purpose for which water is to be applied and (i) if for induced
21 ground water recharge by a public water supplier, a statement of the
22 times of the year when and location along a stream where flows for
23 induced ground water recharge are proposed and (ii) if for irrigation, a
24 description of the land to be irrigated by the water and the amount, and
25 (h) such facts and supporting documentation as are required by the Chief
26 Water Officer department which shall include, but not be limited to, the
27 depth of all wells, the extent of the underlying aquifer, the expected
28 rate of recharge, the minimum flow or flows necessary to sustain the well
29 field throughout the reach identified, and the period of time that a well
30 field would continue to meet minimal essential needs of the public water
31 supplier when there is no flow as those factors relate to and are part of

2 A public water supplier making application for induced ground water
3 recharge may submit with its application a statement of the amount of
4 induced ground water recharge water which the public water supplier
5 presently uses as well as the amount of induced ground water recharge
6 water it anticipates using in the next twenty-five-year period. Such
7 statement shall also quantify the total amount of water the public water
8 supplier presently uses from the well field as well as the total amount
9 of water it anticipates using from the well field in the next twenty-
10 five-year period.
11 (3) Upon receipt of an application containing the information set
12 forth in this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall (a) make
13 a record of the receipt of the application, (b) cause the application to
14 be recorded in its office, and (c) make a careful examination of the
15 application to ascertain whether it sets forth all the facts necessary to
16 enable the Chief Water Officer department to determine the nature and
17 amount of the proposed appropriation. If such an examination shows the
18 application in any way defective, it shall be returned to the applicant
19 for correction, with a statement of the correction required, within
20 ninety days after its receipt. Ninety days shall be allowed for the
21 refiling of the application, and in default of such refiling, the
22 application shall stand dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (4)
23 of this section, if so filed and corrected as required within such time,
24 the application shall, upon being accepted and allowed, take priority as
25 of the date of the original filing, subject to compliance with the future
26 provisions of the law and the rules and regulations thereunder. During
27 the pendency of any application or upon its approval, the Chief Water
28 Officer department, upon proper authorization and request of the
29 applicant, may assign the application a later priority date.

1 water recharge made by a public water supplier shall be:
2 (a) June 27, 1963, for water supply wells and facilities constructed
3 and placed in service on or before June 27, 1963;
4 (b) January 1, 1970, for water supply wells and facilities
5 constructed and placed in service on or after June 28, 1963, and on or
6 before December 31, 1969;
7 (c) January 1, 1980, for water supply wells and facilities
8 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1970, and on or
9 before December 31, 1979;
10 (d) January 1, 1990, for water supply wells and facilities
11 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1980, and on or
12 before December 31, 1989; and
13 (e) January 1, 1993, for water supply wells and facilities
14 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1990, and on or
15 before September 9, 1993.
16 (5) Prior to taking action on an application for induced ground
17 water recharge, the Chief Water Officer director shall publish notice of
18 such application at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
19 three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
20 of the stream segment and also in a newspaper of statewide circulation.
21 The notice shall state that any person having an interest may, in
22 writing, object to the application. Any such objection shall be filed
23 with the Chief Water Officer department within two weeks after the final
24 publication of the notice.
25 (6) After the Chief Water Officer director has accepted the
26 application made under subsection (2) of this section as a completed
27 application and published notice as required under subsection (5) of this
28 section, the Chief Water Officer director shall, if he or she determines
29 that a hearing is necessary, set a time and place for a public hearing on
30 the application. The hearing shall be held within reasonable proximity to
31 the area in which the wells are or would be located. At the hearing the

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 applicant shall present all hydrological data and other evidence
2 supporting its application. All interested parties shall be allowed to
3 testify and present evidence relative to the application.
4 (7) An unapproved application pending on August 26, 1983, may be
5 amended to include appropriation for intentional underground water
6 storage and recovery of such water.
7 (8) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer department
8 for a temporary permit to appropriate water. The same standards for
9 granting a permanent appropriation shall apply for granting such
10 temporary permit except when the temporary permit is for road
11 construction or other public use construction and the amount of water
12 requested is less than ten acre-feet in total volume. For temporary
13 permits for public-use construction, the applicant shall include on the
14 application the location of the diversion, the location of use, a
15 description of the project, the amount of water requested, and the person
16 to contact. Temporary permits for public-use construction and for less
17 than ten acre-feet in total volume may be granted without any
18 determination of unappropriated water and shall be considered to be in
19 the public interest. The requirement of filing a map or plans with the
20 application for a temporary permit may be waived at the discretion of the
21 Chief Water Officer director. In granting a temporary permit, the Chief
22 Water Officer director shall specify a date on which the right to
23 appropriate water under the permit shall expire. Under no circumstances
24 shall such date be longer than one calendar year after the date the
25 temporary permit was granted. Temporary permits shall be administered
26 during times of shortage based on priority. The right to appropriate
27 water shall automatically terminate on the date specified by the Chief
28 Water Officer director on the temporary permit without further action by
29 the Chief Water Officer department.
30 (9) Water may be diverted from any stream, reservoir, or canal by
31 any fire department or emergency response services for the purpose of

2 permit from the Chief Water Officer department. The installation of a dry
3 well for this purpose is allowed without the prior permission of the
4 Chief Water Officer department, but the Chief Water Officer department
5 shall be informed of any such installation, its location, and the party
6 responsible for its installation and maintenance within thirty days after
7 the installation.
8 Sec. 86. Section 46-233.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
9 amended to read:
10 46-233.01 (1) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer
11 department for a permit to appropriate any of the public surface waters
12 of the State of Nebraska to be diverted or stored in Nebraska for use in
13 any other state.
14 (2) In determining whether to grant such application, the Chief
15 Water Officer director shall consider the following factors:
16 (a) Whether unappropriated water exists in the source of supply
17 named in the application;
18 (b) Whether such application and appropriation when perfected are
19 not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
20 (c) Whether denial of the application is demanded by the public
21 interest; and
22 (d) Whether the proposed use is a beneficial use of water.
23 (3) When determining whether denial of such application is demanded
24 by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall consider
25 the following factors:
26 (a) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
27 use;
28 (b) Any adverse economic, environmental, and other impacts of the
29 proposed use;
30 (c) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
31 water;
-99-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (d) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of not allowing
2 the appropriation and preserving the water supply for beneficial uses
3 within the state;
4 (e) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
5 and
6 (f) Any other factors consistent with the purposes of this section
7 that the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant to protecting the
8 interests of the state and its citizens.
9 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
10 overall benefits to Nebraska are greater than the adverse impacts to
11 Nebraska. The Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying
12 an application shall specify the reasons for such action, including a
13 discussion of the required factors for consideration, and shall document
14 such decision by reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any
15 other sources used by the Chief Water Officer director in making the
16 decision.
17 Sec. 87. Section 46-234, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
18 amended to read:
19 46-234 If there is no unappropriated water in the source of supply
20 or if a prior appropriation has been perfected to water the same land to
21 be watered by the applicant, the Chief Water Officer department may
22 refuse such application. An application may also be refused (1) if
23 existing facilities other than those owned or operated by the applicant
24 are to be utilized and the applicant fails to show, by documentary
25 evidence, agreements with the owner and operator of the facilities to
26 allow the applicant to use such facilities or (2) when denial is demanded
27 by the public interest. The party making such application shall not
28 prosecute such work so long as such refusal continues in force. An
29 application for appropriation shall not be exclusive of any of the lands
30 included therein until the owner or owners of such land give consent to
31 the same in proper form duly acknowledged. No application made or canal

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 constructed, prior to the application of the water and the perfection of
2 an appropriation therefor or the filing of the consent, shall prevent
3 other applications from being allowed and other canals from being
4 constructed to irrigate the same lands or any of them. In case of an
5 application for an appropriation of water for the development of water
6 power, the Chief Water Officer department shall promptly act upon such
7 application and limit the time within which such appropriation shall be
8 perfected to the period within which the proposed power project can be
9 completed by uninterrupted and expeditious construction.
10 Sec. 88. Section 46-235, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-235 (1) For applications other than those to appropriate public
13 waters for induced ground water recharge, if there is unappropriated
14 water in the source of supply named in the application, if such
15 application and appropriation when perfected are not otherwise
16 detrimental to the public welfare, and if denial of the application is
17 not demanded by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer department
18 shall approve the application and shall make a record in its office and
19 return the application to the applicant, who shall on receipt thereof be
20 authorized to proceed with the work and to take such measures as may be
21 necessary to perfect such application into an appropriation. The priority
22 of such application and appropriation when perfected shall date from the
23 filing of the application with in the Chief Water Officer office of the
24 department, and the date of filing shall be regarded as the priority
25 number thereof. The Chief Water Officer department may, upon examination
26 of such application, approve it for a shorter period of time for
27 perfecting the proposed appropriation or for a smaller amount of water or
28 of land than applied for. The Chief Water Officer department may also
29 impose such other reasonable conditions as the Chief Water Officer it
30 deems appropriate to protect the public interest. An applicant aggrieved
31 by the action of the Chief Water Officer department shall, upon proper

1 showing, be granted a hearing before the Chief Water Officer department,
2 which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
3 procedure adopted by the Chief Water Officer department, and a full and
4 complete record shall be kept of all such proceedings. When a complete
5 record of the case has been made up, the Chief Water Officer department
6 shall render an opinion of facts and of law based upon the evidence
7 before the Chief Water Officer it.
8 (2)(a) An application for an induced ground water recharge
9 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
10 service before September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief Water
11 Officer director if he or she finds that:
12 (i) The appropriation is necessary to maintain the well or wells for
13 the use or uses for which the appropriation has been requested;
14 (ii) The rate and timing of the flow is the amount reasonably
15 necessary to maintain the well or wells for the uses for which the
16 appropriation has been requested; and
17 (iii) The application is in the public interest and is not
18 detrimental to the public welfare. There shall be a rebuttable
19 presumption that wells which are the subject of an application pursuant
20 to subdivision (2)(a) of this section are in the public interest and are
21 not detrimental to the public welfare.
22 (b) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application for
23 a well or wells constructed before September 9, 1993, but may
24 specifically deny the applicant the right to request regulation of junior
25 appropriators if the Chief Water Officer director, at the time of
26 approval, finds that the well or wells, at the time of their
27 construction, were not located, designed, or constructed so as to take
28 reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the area to minimize the
29 frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced ground water
30 recharge. Thereafter a public water supplier holding an approved
31 application which has been denied the right to request regulation of
-102-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 junior appropriators may petition the Chief Water Officer director for a
2 hearing to present evidence showing the Chief Water Officer director that
3 the well or wells have been modified, relocated, or reconstructed to take
4 reasonable advantage of the aquifer conditions in the area. If the Chief
5 Water Officer director determines that the well or wells have been so
6 modified, relocated, or reconstructed, the Chief Water Officer director
7 shall cause to be modified the approval of the application to allow for
8 the regulation of junior appropriators, subject to the restrictions or
9 conditions applicable to public water suppliers.
10 (c) An application for an induced ground water recharge
11 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
12 service before September 9, 1993, shall not be subject to the
13 requirements of sections 46-288 and 46-289.
14 (3) An application for an induced ground water recharge
15 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed or to be
16 constructed on or after September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief
17 Water Officer director if he or she makes the findings required by
18 subdivision (2)(a) of this section and further finds that:
19 (a) There is unappropriated water available for the appropriation;
20 and
21 (b) The well or wells involved have been or will be located and
22 constructed to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the
23 area to minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for
24 induced ground water recharge.
25 (4)(a) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application
26 filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section for a smaller amount of
27 water than requested by the applicant. The Chief Water Officer director
28 may also impose reasonable conditions on the manner and timing of the
29 appropriation which the Chief Water Officer director deems necessary to
30 protect the public interest. The Chief Water Officer director may grant
31 an appropriation for specific months of the year if so demanded by the

2 application, he or she shall issue a written order, which written order
3 shall include the findings required by this section, the amount of the
4 appropriation, and any conditions or limitations imposed under this
5 section.
6 (b) In determining whether an application for an appropriation for
7 induced ground water recharge is in the public interest, the Chief Water
8 Officer's director's considerations shall include, but not be limited to,
9 the possible adverse effects on existing surface water or ground water
10 users and the economic, social, and environmental value of such uses,
11 including, but not limited to, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife,
12 public water supply, induced ground water recharge for public water
13 supply systems, and water quality maintenance.
14 (c) The stream segment and the determination of a reasonable and
15 necessary amount of water required for induced ground water recharge
16 purposes throughout the reach shall be defined specifically by the Chief
17 Water Officer director in the order issued under this section.
18 Sec. 89. Section 46-235.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 46-235.01 A public water supplier which has received an
21 appropriation for induced ground water recharge pursuant to section
22 46-235 may, from time to time and within twenty-five years after the
23 priority assigned pursuant to section 46-233, petition the Chief Water
24 Officer department for a hearing to present evidence showing that all or
25 part of the original projection for additional water needs specified
26 pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-233 corresponds with the actual
27 use. To the extent the public water supplier is making beneficial use of
28 all or a portion of the water projected in the original application, the
29 right to use such additional water shall vest and the priority date of
30 such anticipated water use shall date back to the priority date assigned
31 pursuant to section 46-233. A public water supplier may not request such

2 application.
3 Sec. 90. Section 46-235.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 46-235.02 (1) Just compensation shall be required if a public water
6 supplier exercises a preference to the injury of a senior appropriator.
7 (2) Just compensation shall be provided by a public water supplier
8 to any injured junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected
9 prior to September 9, 1993, if and to the extent such injury resulted
10 from regulation of junior appropriators requested by the public water
11 supplier to provide water for any purpose other than domestic. Such
12 compensation shall not be required to a junior appropriator if the
13 regulation requested is to provide water for domestic purposes only. At
14 the time any junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected prior
15 to September 9, 1993, is regulated at the request of a public water
16 supplier, the Chief Water Officer department shall determine for each
17 such appropriator the extent to which the regulation is for domestic
18 purposes and the extent to which it is for other purposes.
19 (3) A cause of action for just compensation shall accrue at the time
20 a junior appropriator is regulated by the Chief Water Officer department.
21 Sec. 91. Section 46-235.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-235.03 Natural resources districts shall have the authority to
24 impose restrictions or controls on public water suppliers as specified in
25 the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act. Such
26 restrictions or controls may limit the withdrawal of ground water to a
27 greater degree or extent than is otherwise permitted or allowed by a
28 permit issued by the Chief Water Officer department.
29 Sec. 92. Section 46-235.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 46-235.04 (1) Induced ground water recharge appropriations shall be
-105-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 administered in the same manner as prescribed by Chapter 46, article 2,
2 for other appropriations. Appropriations for induced ground water
3 recharge may be canceled and annulled as provided in sections 46-229.02
4 to 46-229.05.
5 (2) The Chief Water Officer department may approve the transfer of
6 priority dates among water wells, including replacement water wells,
7 located within a single well field that are subject to an induced
8 recharge appropriation, or are part of an application for such an
9 appropriation, to improve the well field's efficiency of operation with
10 respect to river flow. The transfers shall be approved if the Chief Water
11 Officer department finds that (a) the transfers would not increase the
12 quantity of induced ground water recharge under the original priority
13 date or application, (b) the amount of water withdrawn from water wells
14 under the original priority date or application would not increase, (c)
15 the quantity of streamflow needed to sustain well field operation under
16 the original priority date would decrease, (d) the transfer would not
17 impair the rights of other appropriators, and (e) the transfer is in the
18 public interest in the same manner as provided in section 46-235. The
19 Chief Water Officer department may assign multiple priority dates to a
20 single water well that replaces two or more water wells which are
21 abandoned. Replacement water wells installed pursuant to this subsection
22 must be installed within the same well field as the abandoned water well.
23 Notice shall be furnished and any hearing held as provided in sections
24 46-291 and 46-292. For purposes of this subsection, single well field
25 means those contiguous tracts of land owned or leased by the applicant
26 containing two or more water wells subject to induced recharge.
27 Sec. 93. Section 46-236, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-236 An application for appropriation of water for water power
30 shall meet the requirements of section 46-234 and subsection (1) of

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 application for water power and before placing water to any beneficial
2 use, the applicant shall enter into a contract with the State of
3 Nebraska, through the Chief Water Officer department, for leasing the use
4 of all water so appropriated. Such lease shall be upon forms prepared by
5 the Chief Water Officer department, and the time of such lease shall not
6 run for a greater period than fifty years; and for the use of water for
7 power purposes the applicant shall pay into the state treasury on or
8 before January 1 each year fifteen dollars for each one hundred
9 horsepower for all water so appropriated. Upon application of the lessee
10 or its assigns, the Chief Water Officer department shall renew the lease
11 so as to continue it and the water appropriation in full force and effect
12 for an additional period of fifty years.
13 Upon the failure of the applicant to comply with any of the
14 provisions of such lease and the failure to pay any of such fees, the
15 Chief Water Officer department shall notify the lessee that the required
16 fees have not been paid to the Chief Water Officer department or that the
17 lessee is not otherwise in compliance with the provisions of the lease.
18 If the lessee has not come into compliance with all provisions of the
19 lease or has not paid to the Chief Water Officer department all required
20 fees within fifteen calendar days after the date of such notice, the
21 Chief Water Officer department shall issue an order denying the applicant
22 the right to divert or otherwise use the water appropriation for power
23 production. The Chief Water Officer department shall rescind the order
24 denying use of the water appropriation at such time as the lessee has
25 come into compliance with all provisions of the lease and has paid all
26 required fees to the Chief Water Officer department. If after forty-five
27 calendar days from the date of issuance of the order the lessee is not in
28 compliance with all provisions of the lease or required fees have not
29 been paid to the Chief Water Officer department, such lease and water
30 appropriation shall be canceled by the Chief Water Officer department.

1 amended to read:
2 46-237 (1) Within six months after approval and allowance of an
3 application other than an application to appropriate public waters for
4 induced ground water recharge, the applicant shall file with in the Chief
5 Water Officer office of the department a map or plat which shall conform
6 to the rules and regulations of the department as to material, size,
7 coloring, and scale. Such map or plat shall show the source from which
8 the proposed appropriation is to be taken and all proposed dams, dikes,
9 reservoirs, canals, powerhouses, and other structures for the purpose of
10 storing, conveying, or using water for any purpose whatsoever and their
11 true courses or positions in connection with the boundary lines and
12 corners of lands which they occupy. The lands to be irrigated shall be
13 identified in the manner prescribed by the department. No rights shall be
14 deemed to have been acquired until the provisions of this section have
15 been complied with. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section,
16 failure to so comply shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all
17 rights thereunder.
18 (2) For any appropriation with a priority date earlier than 1958 but
19 for which either the appropriator has failed to comply with the
20 requirements of subsection (1) of this section or a map or plat required
21 by such subsection has been lost or destroyed through no fault of the
22 appropriator, the lack of such compliance or of such map or plat shall
23 not be the basis for an a departmental adjudication or cancellation of
24 the appropriation by the Chief Water Officer and the appropriation shall
25 not be subject to legal challenge by any party on that basis.
26 (3) The Chief Water Officer department may notify any appropriator
27 subject to subsection (2) of this section of the need to file a map or
28 plat of lands under such appropriation. Unless the Chief Water Officer
29 department grants an extension for good cause shown, the appropriator
30 shall file the required map within three years after that notification
31 and such map shall conform to the rules and regulations of the Chief

10 shall commence the excavation or construction of the works in which it is
11 intended to divert the water and the actual construction of any water
12 power plant and reservoir or reservoirs for storage in connection
13 therewith and shall vigorously, diligently, and uninterruptedly prosecute
14 such work to completion unless temporarily interrupted by some
15 unavoidable and natural cause. A failure to comply with this section
16 shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the
17 appropriation. The cost of promotion and engineering work shall not be
18 considered a part of the cost of construction, and the progress of the
19 construction work shall be such that one-tenth of the total work shall be
20 completed within one year from the date of approval of the application.
21 The construction of all work required in connection with the proposed
22 project shall be prosecuted in the manner described in this section and
23 with such a force as shall assure the average rate of constructional
24 progress necessary to complete such work or works within the time
25 stipulated in the approval of such application, notwithstanding the
26 ordinary delays and casualties that must be expected and provided
27 against. A failure to carry on the construction of either an irrigation
28 project or a water power project as outlined in this section shall work a
29 forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the appropriation,
30 and the Chief Water Officer department shall cancel such appropriation.
31 The Chief Water Officer department shall have free access to all records,

6 for physical valuation purposes.
7 (2) The Chief Water Officer department may extend, for reasonable
8 lengths of time, the time for commencing excavation or construction,
9 completion of works, the application of water to a beneficial use, or any
10 of the other requirements for completing or perfecting an application for
11 flow or storage rights as fixed in the approval of an application or
12 otherwise for the appropriation of water. Such extension may be granted
13 upon a petition to the Chief Water Officer department and the showing of
14 reasonable cause. The Chief Water Officer department shall cause a notice
15 of each petition received to be published at the petitioner's expense in
16 at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties
17 of the appropriation once a week for three consecutive weeks. The Chief
18 Water Officer department shall hold a hearing on the issue of extension

2 originate shall be entitled to such additional appropriation or
3 appropriations from the direct flow of such stream, within the statutory
4 limits provided by law, as may be necessary and required for the
5 production of crops in the practice of good husbandry. Applications for
6 such supplemental additional appropriations from the direct flow, upon
7 the approval or granting thereof, shall have priority within the drainage
8 basin as of the date such applications are filed with in the Chief Water
9 Officer office of the department.
10 Sec. 97. Section 46-241, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-241 (1) Every person intending to construct and operate a storage
13 reservoir for irrigation or any other beneficial purpose or intending to
14 construct and operate a facility for intentional underground water
15 storage and recovery shall, except as provided in subsections (2) and (3)
16 of this section and section 46-243, make an application to the Chief
17 Water Officer department upon the prescribed form and provide such plans,
18 drawings, and specifications as are necessary to comply with the Safety
19 of Dams and Reservoirs Act. Such application shall be filed and
20 proceedings had thereunder in the same manner and under the same rules
21 and regulations as other applications. Upon the approval of such
22 application under this section and any approval required by the act, the
23 applicant shall have the right to construct and impound in such
24 reservoir, or store in and recover from such underground water storage
25 facility, all water not otherwise appropriated and any appropriated water
26 not needed for immediate use, to construct and operate necessary ditches
27 for the purpose of conducting water to such storage reservoir or
28 facility, and to condemn land for such reservoir, ditches, or other
29 facility. The procedure to condemn property shall be exercised in the
30 manner set forth in sections 76-704 to 76-724.

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 water storage impounding capacity of less than fifteen acre-feet measured
2 below the crest of the lowest open outlet or overflow shall be exempt
3 from subsection (1) of this section as long as there will be (a) no
4 diversion or withdrawal of water from the reservoir for any purpose other
5 than for watering range livestock and (b) no release from the reservoir
6 to provide water for a downstream diversion or withdrawal for any purpose
7 other than for watering range livestock. This subsection does not exempt
8 any person from the requirements of the Safety of Dams and Reservoirs Act
9 or section 54-2425.
10 (3) Any person intending to construct a reservoir, holding pond, or
11 lagoon for the sole purpose of holding, managing, or disposing of animal
12 or human waste shall be exempt from subsection (1) of this section. This
13 subsection does not exempt any person from any requirements of the Safety
14 of Dams and Reservoirs Act or section 46-233 or 54-2425.
15 (4) Every person intending to modify or rehabilitate an existing
16 storage reservoir so that its impounding capacity is to be increased
17 shall comply with subsection (1) of this section.
18 (5) The owner of a storage reservoir or facility shall be liable for
19 all damages arising from leakage or overflow of the water therefrom or
20 from the breaking of the embankment of such reservoir. The owner or
21 possessor of a reservoir or intentional underground water storage
22 facility does not have the right to store water in such reservoir or
23 facility during the time that such water is required downstream in
24 ditches for direct irrigation or for any reservoir or facility holding a
25 senior right. Every person who owns, controls, or operates a reservoir or
26 intentional underground water storage facility, except political
27 subdivisions of this state, shall be required to pass through the outlets
28 of such reservoir or facility, whether presently existing or hereafter
29 constructed, a portion of the measured inflows to furnish water for
30 livestock in such amounts and at such times as directed by the Chief
31 Water Officer department to meet the requirements for such purposes as

1 determined by the Chief Water Officer department, except that a reservoir
2 or facility owner shall not be required to release water for this purpose
3 which has been legally stored. Any dam shall be constructed in accordance
4 with the Safety of Dams and Reservoirs Act, and the outlet works shall be
5 installed so that water may be released in compliance with this section.
6 The requirement for outlet works may be waived by the Chief Water Officer
7 department upon a showing of good cause. Whenever any person diverts
8 water from a public stream and returns it into the same stream, he or she
9 may take out the same amount of water, less a reasonable deduction for
10 losses in transit, to be determined by the Chief Water Officer
11 department, if no prior appropriator for beneficial use is prejudiced by
12 such diversion.
13 (6) An application for storage and recovery of water intentionally
14 stored underground may be made only by an appropriator of record who
15 shows, by documentary evidence, sufficient interest in the underground
16 water storage facility to entitle the applicant to the water requested.
17 Sec. 98. Section 46-242, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
18 amended to read:
19 46-242 (1) After the completion to the satisfaction of the Chief

21 been obtained pursuant to section 46-241, any person proposing to apply
22 to beneficial use the water stored shall file with the Chief Water
23 Officer department an application for a permit particularly describing
24 the use to which the water is to be applied and, if for irrigation,
25 describing the land to be irrigated.
26 (2) Application may be made for a permit to appropriate water for
27 the irrigation of land lying both upstream and downstream from a storage
28 reservoir or intentional underground water storage facility. Under an
29 approved application for a permit to appropriate water stored in a
30 reservoir or facility for use on land upstream from such reservoir or
31 facility, water may be diverted from the stream by the applicant and a
-113-
ER36 ER36

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 compensating amount of water shall be released from the reservoir or
2 facility for the use of downstream appropriators, but the rights of prior
3 appropriators shall not be adversely affected by such exchange of water.
4 (3) The owner of a storage reservoir shall have a preferred right to
5 make such application for a period of six months from the time limited
6 for the completion of such reservoir. The date of the expiration of such
7 period shall be endorsed upon the application when allowed. If an
8 application is made by a person other than the owner of a reservoir at
9 any time, the application shall not be approved by the Chief Water
10 Officer department until the applicant shows, by documentary evidence,
11 sufficient interest in such storage reservoir to entitle the applicant to
12 enough water for the purpose set forth in the application.
13 (4) Application may be made for a permit to appropriate water from a
14 storage reservoir, subject to subsection (3) of this section, or an
15 intentional underground water storage facility, subject to subsection (6)
16 of section 46-241, for instream use of water for recreation or fish and
17 wildlife if the appropriation will not prejudice the rights of any prior
18 appropriator for a beneficial use.
19 (5) An unapproved application for a permit pursuant to this section
20 which is pending on August 26, 1983, may be amended to include use of
21 stored water for intentional underground water storage.
22 Sec. 99. Section 46-250, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
23 amended to read:
24 46-250 The owner of any ditch, storage reservoir, storage capacity,
25 or other device for appropriating water may, upon petition to the Chief
26 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources, and upon its approval,
27 change the point at which the water under any water appropriation of
28 record is diverted from a natural stream or reservoir, change the line of
29 any flume, ditch, or aqueduct, or change a storage site. No reclamation
30 district or power appropriator may change the established return flow
31 point without the approval of the Chief Water Officer department.

2 amended to read:
3 46-252 (1) Any person may conduct, either from outside the state or
4 from sources located in the state, quantities of water over and above
5 those already present into or along any of the natural streams or
6 channels of this state, for purposes of instream beneficial uses or
7 withdrawal of some or all of such water for out-of-stream beneficial
8 uses, at any point without regard to any prior appropriation of water
9 from such stream, due allowance being made for losses in transit to be
10 determined by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources.
11 The Chief Water Officer department shall monitor movement of the water by
12 measurements or other means and shall be responsible for assuring that
13 such quantities are not subsequently diverted or withdrawn by others
14 unless they are authorized to do so by the person conducting the water.
15 (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section,
16 before any person may conduct water into or along any of the natural
17 streams or channels of the state, he or she shall first obtain a permit
18 from the Chief Water Officer department. Application for the permit shall
19 be made on forms provided by the Chief Water Officer department.
20 Applications shall include plans and specifications detailing the
21 intended times, amounts, and streamreach locations and such other
22 information as required by the Chief Water Officer department. The water
23 subject to such a permit shall be deemed appropriated for the use
24 specified in the permit. Permitholders shall be liable for any damages
25 resulting from the overflow of such stream or channel when water so
26 conducted contributed to such overflow.
27 (3) Any person actually engaged in the construction or operation of
28 any water power plant may, without filing with the Chief Water Officer
29 department and upon payment of all damages, use any such stream or
30 channel for a tailrace or canal and may, whenever necessary, widen,

12 closes, changes, or interferes with any headgate or controlling gate, or
13 by any method or means takes any water from any natural stream,
14 reservoir, or other source, through any ditch or canal to any land or
15 lands, or allows the same to be done, or uses or allows to be used any
16 water upon any land or lands, or for any other purpose whatsoever,
17 without authority from the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
18 Resources, or who stores water in or releases water from a reservoir
19 other than in compliance with orders of the Chief Water Officer Director
20 of Natural Resources or his or her representative, shall be guilty of a
21 Class II misdemeanor. Each day that the water is allowed to run without
22 authority from the Chief Water Officer department shall constitute a
23 separate offense.

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 of an Act of Congress approved June 17, 1902, being An Act providing for
2 the reclamation of arid lands (32 Stat. L. 388), and all acts amendatory
3 thereof and supplemental thereto. When the officers of the United States
4 Bureau of Reclamation determine that any water so developed or stored is
5 in excess of the needs of the project as then completed or is flood or
6 unused water, the United States may contract to furnish such developed,
7 stored, flood, or unused water, under the terms and conditions imposed by
8 Act of Congress and the rules and regulations of the United States, to
9 any person who may have theretofore been granted a permit to appropriate
10 a portion of the normal flow of any stream, if the water so appropriated
11 shall, during some portion of the year, be found insufficient for the
12 needs of the land to which it is appurtenant. The United States and every
13 person entering into a contract as herein provided shall have the right
14 to conduct such water into and along any of the natural streams of the
15 state, but not so as to raise the waters thereof above the ordinary high
16 water mark, and may take out the same again at any point desired, without
17 regard to the prior rights of others to water from the same stream; but
18 due allowance shall be made for losses in transit, the amount of such
19 allowance to be determined by the Chief Water Officer Department of

25 46-286 An ephemeral natural stream shall mean that portion of a
26 natural stream in which water flows only after a precipitation event or
27 when augmented by surface water runoff caused by the pumping of ground
28 water for irrigation. The portion of a natural stream that is shown as an
29 intermittent stream on the most recent United States Geological Survey
30 topographic quadrangle map published prior to July 18, 2008, shall be
31 considered an ephemeral natural stream unless the Chief Water Officer

12 (2) Beneficial use shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable
13 and efficient use of water for domestic, municipal, agricultural,
14 industrial, commercial, power production, subirrigation, fish and
15 wildlife, ground water recharge, interstate compact, water quality
16 maintenance, or recreational purposes. Nothing in this subdivision shall
17 be construed to affect the preferences for use of surface water as
18 provided in section 46-204;
19 (3) Interbasin transfer shall mean the diversion of water in one
20 river basin and the transportation of such water to another river basin
21 for storage or utilization for a beneficial use; and
22 (4) River basin shall mean any of the following natural hydrologic
23 basins of the state as shown on maps located in the Department of Water,
24 Energy, and Environment Natural Resources: (a) The White River and Hat
25 Creek basin; (b) the Niobrara River basin; (c) the Platte River basin,
26 including the North Platte and South Platte River basins, except that for
27 purposes of transfer between the North and South Platte River basins each
28 shall be considered a separate river basin; (d) the Loup River basin; (e)

1 Sec. 109. Section 46-289, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 46-289 The Legislature finds, recognizes, and declares that the
4 transfer of water to outside the boundaries of a river basin may have
5 impacts on the water and other resources in the basin and that such
6 impacts differ from those caused by uses of water within the same basin
7 in part because any unused water will not be returned to the stream from
8 which it is taken for further use in that river basin. The Legislature
9 therefor recognizes the need to delineate factors for consideration by
10 the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
11 Environment Director of Natural Resources when evaluating an application
12 made pursuant to section 46-233 which involves an interbasin transfer of
13 water in order to determine whether denial of such application is
14 demanded by the public interest. Those considerations shall include, but
15 not be limited to, the following factors:
16 (1) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
17 interbasin transfer and use;
18 (2) Any adverse impacts of the proposed interbasin transfer and use;
19 (3) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
20 water in the basin of origin;
21 (4) Any reasonably foreseeable future beneficial uses of the water
22 in the basin of origin;
23 (5) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of leaving the
24 water in the basin of origin for current or future beneficial uses;
25 (6) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
26 and
27 (7) Alternative sources of water available to the basin of origin
28 for future beneficial uses.
29 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
30 overall benefits to the state and the applicant's basin are greater than
31 or equal to the adverse impacts to the state and the basin of origin. The

12 use of such appropriation to a location other than the location specified
13 in the permit, (ii) to change that appropriation to a different type of
14 appropriation as provided in subsection (3) of this section, or (iii) to
15 change the purpose for which the water is to be used under a natural-
16 flow, storage, or storage-use appropriation to a purpose not at that time
17 permitted under the appropriation shall apply for approval of such

1 transferred, (vii) if a transfer is proposed, whether other sources of
2 water are available at the original location of use and whether any
3 provisions have been made to prevent either use of a new source of water
4 at the original location or increased use of water from any existing
5 source at that location, (viii) if applicable, the legal descriptions of
6 the beginning and end of the stream reach to which the appropriation is
7 proposed to be transferred for the purpose of augmenting the flows in
8 that stream reach, (ix) if a proposed transfer is for the purpose of
9 increasing the quantity of water available for use pursuant to another
10 appropriation, the number assigned to such other appropriation by the
11 Chief Water Officer department, (x) the purpose of the current use, (xi)
12 if a change in purpose of use is proposed, the proposed purpose of use,
13 (xii) if a change in the type of appropriation is proposed, the type of
14 appropriation to which a change is desired, (xiii) if a proposed transfer
15 or change is to be temporary in nature, the duration of the proposed
16 transfer or change, and (xiv) such other information as the Chief Water
17 Officer department by rule and regulation requires.
18 (2) If a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, a
19 copy of the proposed agreement between the current appropriator and the
20 person who is to be responsible for use of water under the appropriation
21 while the transfer or change is in effect shall be submitted at the same
22 time as the application.
23 (3) Regardless of whether a transfer or a change in the purpose of
24 use is involved, the following changes in type of appropriation, if found
25 by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
26 Environment Director of Natural Resources to be consistent with section
27 46-294, may be approved subject to the following:
28 (a) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use may be
29 changed to a natural-flow appropriation for aboveground reservoir storage
30 or for intentional underground water storage;
31 (b) A natural-flow appropriation for intentional underground water
-124-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 storage may be changed to a natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-
2 stream use or for aboveground reservoir storage;
3 (c) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
4 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
5 storage may be changed to an instream appropriation subject to sections
6 46-2,107 to 46-2,119 if the Chief Water Officer director determines that
7 the resulting instream appropriation would be consistent with
8 subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of section 46-2,115;
9 (d) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
10 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
11 storage may be changed to an appropriation for induced ground water
12 recharge if the Chief Water Officer director determines that the
13 resulting appropriation for induced ground water recharge would be
14 consistent with subdivisions (2)(a)(i) and (ii) of section 46-235;
15 (e) An appropriation for the manufacturing of hydropower at a
16 facility located on a natural stream channel may be permanently changed
17 in full to an instream basin-management appropriation to be held jointly
18 by the Game and Parks Commission and any natural resources district or
19 combination of natural resources districts. The beneficial use of such
20 change is to maintain the streamflow for fish, wildlife, and recreation
21 that was available from the manufacturing of hydropower prior to the
22 change. Such changed appropriation may also be utilized by the owners of
23 the appropriation to assist in the implementation of an approved
24 integrated management plan or plans developed pursuant to sections 46-714
25 to 46-718 for each natural resources district within the river basin. Any
26 such change under this section shall be subject to review under sections
27 46-229 to 46-229.06 to ensure that the beneficial uses of the change of
28 use are still being achieved; and
29 (f) The incidental underground water storage portion, whether or not
30 previously quantified, of a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation may
31 be separated from the direct-use portion of the appropriation and may be
-125-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 changed to a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation for intentional
2 underground water storage at the same location if the historic
3 consumptive use of the direct-use portion of the appropriation is
4 transferred to another location or is terminated, but such a separation
5 and change may be approved only if, after the separation and change, (i)
6 the total permissible diversion under the appropriation will not
7 increase, (ii) the projected consequences of the separation and change
8 are consistent with the provisions of any integrated management plan
9 adopted in accordance with section 46-718 or 46-719 for the geographic
10 area involved, and (iii) if the location of the proposed intentional
11 underground water storage is in a river basin, subbasin, or reach
12 designated as overappropriated in accordance with section 46-713, the
13 integrated management plan for that river basin, subbasin, or reach has
14 gone into effect, and that plan requires that the amount of the
15 intentionally stored water that is consumed after the change will be no
16 greater than the amount of the incidentally stored water that was
17 consumed prior to the change. Approval of a separation and change
18 pursuant to this subdivision (f) shall not exempt any consumptive use
19 associated with the incidental recharge right from any reduction in water
20 use required by an integrated management plan for a river basin,
21 subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated in accordance with
22 section 46-713.
23 Whenever any change in type of appropriation is approved pursuant to
24 this subsection and as long as that change remains in effect, the
25 appropriation shall be subject to the statutes, rules, and regulations
26 that apply to the type of appropriation to which the change has been
27 made.
28 (4) The Legislature finds that induced ground water recharge
29 appropriations issued pursuant to sections 46-233 and 46-235 and instream
30 appropriations issued pursuant to section 46-2,115 are specific to the
31 location identified in the appropriation. Neither type of appropriation
-126-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 shall be transferred to a different location, changed to a different type
2 of appropriation, or changed to permit a different purpose of use.
3 (5) In addition to any other purposes for which transfers and
4 changes may be approved, such transfers and changes may be approved if
5 the purpose is (a) to maintain or augment the flow in a specific stream
6 reach for any instream use that the Chief Water Officer department has
7 determined, through rules and regulations, to be a beneficial use or (b)
8 to increase the frequency that a diversion rate or rate of flow specified
9 in another valid appropriation is achieved.
10 For any transfer or change approved pursuant to subdivision (a) of
11 this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall be provided
12 with a report at least every five years while such transfer or change is
13 in effect. The purpose of such report shall be to indicate whether the
14 beneficial instream use for which the flow is maintained or augmented
15 continues to exist. If the report indicates that it does not or if no
16 report is filed within sixty days after the Chief Water Officer's
17 department's notice to the appropriator that the deadline for filing the
18 report has passed, the Chief Water Officer department may cancel the its
19 approval of the transfer or change and such appropriation shall revert to
20 the same location of use, type of appropriation, and purpose of use as
21 prior to such approval.
22 (6) A quantified or unquantified appropriation for incidental
23 underground water storage may be transferred to a new location along with
24 the direct-use appropriation with which it is recognized if the Chief
25 Water Officer director finds such transfer to be consistent with section
26 46-294 and determines that the geologic and other relevant conditions at
27 the new location are such that incidental underground water storage will
28 occur at the new location. The Chief Water Officer director may request
29 such information from the applicant as is needed to make such
30 determination and may modify any such quantified appropriation for
31 incidental underground water storage, if necessary, to reflect the
-127-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 geologic and other conditions at the new location.
2 (7) Unless an incidental underground water storage appropriation is
3 changed as authorized by subdivision (3)(f) of this section or is
4 transferred as authorized by subsection (6) of this section or subsection
5 (1) of section 46-291, such appropriation shall be canceled or modified,
6 as appropriate, by the Chief Water Officer director to reflect any
7 reduction in water that will be stored underground as the result of a
8 transfer or change of the direct-use appropriation with which the
9 incidental underground water storage was recognized prior to the transfer
10 or change.
11 (8) Any appropriation for manufacturing of hydropower changed under
12 subdivision (3)(e) of this section shall maintain the priority date and
13 preference category of the original manufacturing appropriation and shall
14 be subject to condemnation and subordination pursuant to sections 70-668
15 and 70-669. Any person holding a subordination agreement that was
16 established prior to such change of appropriation shall be entitled to
17 enter into a new subordination agreement for terms consistent with the
18 original subordination agreement at no additional cost. Any person having
19 obtained a condemnation award that was established prior to such change
20 of appropriation shall be entitled to the same benefits created by such
21 award, and any obligations created by such award shall become the
22 obligations of the new owner of the appropriation changed under this
23 section.
24 Sec. 111. Section 46-291, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 46-291 (1) Upon receipt of an application filed under section 46-290
27 for a transfer in the location of use of an appropriation, the Chief
28 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall review it for
29 compliance with this subsection. The Chief Water Officer Director of
30 Natural Resources may approve the application without notice or hearing
31 if he or she determines that: (a) The appropriation is used and will
-128-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 continue to be used exclusively for irrigation purposes; (b) the only
2 lands involved in the proposed transfer are (i) lands within the quarter
3 section of land to which the appropriation is appurtenant, (ii) lands
4 within such quarter section of land and one or more quarter sections of
5 land each of which is contiguous to the quarter section of land to which
6 the appropriation is appurtenant, or (iii) lands within the boundaries or
7 service area of and capable of service by the same irrigation district,
8 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
9 irrigation or canal company; (c) after the transfer, the total number of
10 acres irrigated under the appropriation will be no greater than the
11 number of acres that could legally be irrigated under the appropriation
12 prior to the transfer; (d) all the land involved in the transfer is under
13 the same ownership or is within the same irrigation district, reclamation
14 district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or
15 canal company; (e) the transfer will not result in a change in the point
16 of diversion or the point of diversion will be changed but the change
17 meets the following requirements: (i) The new point of diversion is on
18 the same named stream, the same tributary, or the same river or creek as
19 the approved point of diversion; (ii) the proposed point of diversion
20 will not move above or below an existing diversion point owned by another
21 appropriator; and (iii) the proposed point of diversion will not move
22 above or below a tributary stream or a constructed river return or a
23 constructed drain; and (f) the transfer will not diminish the water
24 supply available for or otherwise adversely affect any other surface
25 water appropriator. If transfer of an appropriation with associated
26 incidental underground water storage is approved in accordance with this
27 subsection, the associated incidental underground water storage also may
28 be transferred pursuant to this subsection as long as such transfer would
29 continue to be consistent with the requirements of this subsection. If
30 necessary, the boundaries of the incidental underground water storage
31 area may be modified to reflect any change in the location of that
-129-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 storage consistent with such a transfer. Transfers shall not be approved
2 pursuant to this subsection until the Chief Water Officer department has
3 adopted and promulgated rules and regulations establishing the criteria
4 the Chief Water Officer it will use to determine whether proposed
5 transfers are consistent with subdivision (1)(f) of this section.
6 (2) If after reviewing an application filed under section 46-290 the
7 Chief Water Officer director determines that it cannot be approved
8 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, he or she shall cause a
9 notice of such application to be posted on the department's website of
10 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment, to be sent by certified
11 mail to each holder of a mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent
12 consensual security interest that is identified by the applicant pursuant
13 to subdivision (1)(b)(v) of section 46-290 and to any entity owning
14 facilities currently used or proposed to be used for purposes of
15 diversion or delivery of water under the appropriation, and to be
16 published at the applicant's expense at least once each week for three
17 consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
18 each county containing lands to which the appropriation is appurtenant
19 and, if applicable, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
20 each county containing lands to which the appropriation is proposed to be
21 transferred.
22 (3) The notice shall contain: (a) A description of the
23 appropriation; (b) the number assigned to such appropriation in the
24 records of the department; (c) the date of priority; (d) if applicable, a
25 description of the land or stream reach to which such water appropriation
26 is proposed to be transferred; (e) if applicable, the type of
27 appropriation to which the appropriation is proposed to be changed; (f)
28 if applicable, the proposed change in the purpose of use; (g) whether the
29 proposed transfer or change is to be permanent or temporary and, if
30 temporary, the duration of the proposed transfer or change; and (h) any
31 other information the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant and
-130-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 essential to provide the interested public with adequate notice of the
2 proposed transfer or change.
3 (4) The notice shall state (a) that any interested person may object
4 to and request a hearing on the application by filing such objections in
5 writing specifically stating the grounds for each objection and (b) that
6 any such objection and request shall be filed with in the Chief Water
7 Officer office of the department within two weeks after the date of final
8 publication of the notice.
9 (5) Within the time period allowed by this section for the filing of
10 objections and requests for hearings, the county board of any county
11 containing land to which the appropriation is appurtenant and, if
12 applicable, the county board of any county containing land to which the
13 appropriation is proposed to be transferred may provide the Chief Water
14 Officer department with comments about the potential economic impacts of
15 the proposed transfer or change in such county. The filing of any such
16 comments by a county board shall not make the county a party in the
17 application process, but such comments shall be considered by the Chief
18 Water Officer director in determining pursuant to section 46-294 whether
19 the proposed transfer or change is in the public interest.
20 Sec. 112. Section 46-292, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-292 The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources may
23 hold a hearing on an application filed under section 46-290 on the Chief
24 Water Officer's its own motion and shall hold a hearing if a timely
25 request therefor is filed by any interested person in accordance with
26 section 46-291. Any such hearing shall be subject to section 61-206.
27 Sec. 113. Section 46-293, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-293 (1) The Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water,
30 Energy, and Environment Director of Natural Resources shall independently
31 review each application subject to subsection (2) of section 46-291 to

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 determine whether the requirements of section 46-294 will be met if the
2 transfer or change is approved. The requirement of this subsection is not
3 altered when there are objectors who have become parties to the proposed
4 transfer or change, but if a hearing is called by the Chief Water Officer
5 Department of Natural Resources on the Chief Water Officer's its own
6 motion or as the result of a request therefor filed in accordance with
7 subsection (4) of section 46-291, any evidence considered by the Chief
8 Water Officer director in making such determinations shall be made a part
9 of the record of the hearing as provided in section 84-914.
10 (2) Either on his or her own motion or in response to objections or
11 comments received pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of section 46-291,
12 the Chief Water Officer director may require the applicant to provide
13 additional information before a hearing will be scheduled or, if no
14 hearing is to be held, before the application will receive further
15 consideration. The information requested may include economic, social, or
16 environmental impact analyses of the proposed transfer or change,
17 information about the amount of water historically consumed under the
18 appropriation, copies of any plans for mitigation of any anticipated
19 adverse impacts that would result from the proposed transfer or change,
20 and such other information as the Chief Water Officer director deems
21 necessary in order to determine whether the proposed transfer or change
22 is consistent with section 46-294.
23 Sec. 114. Section 46-294, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-294 (1) Except for applications approved in accordance with
26 subsection (1) of section 46-291, the Chief Water Officer of the
27 Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Director of Natural
28 Resources shall approve an application filed pursuant to section 46-290
29 only if the application and the proposed transfer or change meet the
30 following requirements:
31 (a) The application is complete and all other information requested
-132-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 pursuant to section 46-293 has been provided;
2 (b) The proposed use of water after the transfer or change will be a
3 beneficial use of water;
4 (c)(i) Any requested transfer in the location of use is within the
5 same river basin as defined in section 46-288 or (ii) the river basin
6 from which the appropriation is to be transferred is tributary to the
7 river basin to which the appropriation is to be transferred;
8 (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,
9 the proposed transfer or change, alone or when combined with any new or
10 increased use of any other source of water at the original location or
11 within the same irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
12 and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company for the
13 original or other purposes, will not diminish the supply of water
14 available for or otherwise adversely affect any other water appropriator
15 and will not significantly adversely affect any riparian water user who
16 files an objection in writing pursuant to section 46-291;
17 (e) The quantity of water that is transferred for diversion or other
18 use at the new location will not exceed the historic consumptive use
19 under the appropriation or portion thereof being transferred, except that
20 this subdivision does not apply to (i) a transfer in the location of use
21 if both the current use and the proposed use are for irrigation, the
22 number of acres to be irrigated will not increase after the transfer, and
23 the location of the diversion from the stream will not change or (ii) a
24 transfer or change in the purpose of use of a surface water irrigation
25 appropriation as provided for in subsection (3), (5), or (6) of section
26 46-290 if the transfer or change in purpose will not diminish the supply
27 of water available or otherwise adversely affect any other water
28 appropriator, adversely affect Nebraska's ability to meet its obligations
29 under a multistate agreement, or result in administration of the prior
30 appropriation system by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
31 Resources, which would not have otherwise occurred;
-133-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (f) The appropriation, prior to the transfer or change, is not
2 subject to termination or cancellation pursuant to sections 46-229 to
3 46-229.04;
4 (g) If a proposed transfer or change is of an appropriation that has
5 been used for irrigation and is in the name of an irrigation district,
6 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
7 irrigation or canal company or is dependent upon any such district's or
8 company's facilities for water delivery, such district or company has
9 approved the transfer or change;
10 (h) If the proposed transfer or change is of a storage-use
11 appropriation and if the owner of that appropriation is different from
12 the owner of the associated storage appropriation, the owner of the
13 storage appropriation has approved the transfer or change;
14 (i) If the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent, either
15 (i) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the transfer or
16 change is in the same preference category established by section 46-204
17 as the purpose for which the water is to be used after the transfer or
18 change or (ii) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the
19 transfer or change and the purpose for which the water is to be used
20 after the transfer or change are both purposes for which no preferences
21 are established by section 46-204;
22 (j) If the proposed transfer or change is to be temporary, it will
23 be for a duration of no less than one year and, except as provided in
24 section 46-294.02, no more than thirty years;
25 (k) The transfer or change will not be inconsistent with any
26 applicable state or federal law and will not jeopardize the state's
27 compliance with any applicable interstate water compact or decree or
28 cause difficulty in fulfilling the provisions of any other formal state
29 contract or agreement; and
30 (l) The proposed transfer or change is in the public interest. The
31 Chief Water Officer's director's considerations relative to the public
-134-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 interest shall include, but not be limited to, (i) the economic, social,
2 and environmental impacts of the proposed transfer or change and (ii)
3 whether and under what conditions other sources of water are available
4 for the uses to be made of the appropriation after the proposed transfer
5 or change. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall
6 adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to govern the Chief Water
7 Officer's director's determination of whether a proposed transfer or
8 change is in the public interest.
9 (2) The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed
10 transfer or change will comply with subdivisions (1)(a) through (l) of
11 this section, except that (a) the burden is on a riparian user to
12 demonstrate his or her riparian status and to demonstrate a significant
13 adverse effect on his or her use in order to prevent approval of an
14 application and (b) if both the current use and the proposed use after a
15 transfer are for irrigation, the number of acres to be irrigated will not
16 increase after the transfer, and the location of the diversion from the
17 stream will not change, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
18 transfer will be consistent with subdivision (1)(d) of this section.
19 (3) In approving an application, the Chief Water Officer director
20 may impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to protect the
21 public interest, to ensure consistency with any of the other criteria in
22 subsection (1) of this section, or to provide the Chief Water Officer
23 department with information needed to properly and efficiently administer
24 the appropriation while the transfer or change remains in effect. If
25 necessary to prevent diminution of supply for any other appropriator, the
26 conditions imposed by the Chief Water Officer director shall require that
27 historic return flows be maintained or replaced in quantity, timing, and
28 location. After approval of any such transfer or change, the
29 appropriation shall be subject to all water use restrictions and
30 requirements in effect at any new location of use and, if applicable, at
31 any new diversion location. An appropriation for which a transfer or
-135-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 change has been approved shall retain the same priority date as that of
2 the original appropriation. If an approved transfer or change is
3 temporary, the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation
4 shall revert to the location of use, purpose of use, or type of
5 appropriation prior to the transfer or change.
6 (4) In approving an application for a transfer, the Chief Water
7 Officer director may also authorize the overlying of water appropriations
8 on the same lands, except that if any such overlying of appropriations
9 would result in either the authorized diversion rate or the authorized
10 aggregate annual quantity that could be diverted to be greater than is
11 otherwise permitted by section 46-231, the Chief Water Officer director
12 shall limit the total diversion rate or aggregate annual quantity for the
13 appropriations overlain to the rate or quantity that he or she determines
14 is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of
15 crops on the land involved. The Chief Water Officer director may also
16 authorize a greater number of acres to be irrigated if the amount and
17 rate of water approved under the original appropriation is not increased
18 by the change of location. An increase in the number of acres to be
19 irrigated shall be approved only if (a) such an increase will not
20 diminish the supply of water available to or otherwise adversely affect
21 another water appropriator or (b) the transfer would not adversely affect
22 the water supply for any river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been
23 designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined
24 to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 and (i) the number of
25 acres authorized under the appropriation when originally approved has not
26 been increased previously, (ii) the increase in the number of acres
27 irrigated will not exceed five percent of the number of acres being
28 irrigated under the permit before the proposed transfer or a total of ten
29 acres, whichever acreage is less, and (iii) all the use will be either on
30 the quarter section to which the appropriation was appurtenant before the
31 transfer or on an adjacent quarter section.

1 Sec. 115. Section 46-294.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
2 is amended to read:
3 46-294.01 Whenever a temporary transfer is approved in accordance
4 with sections 46-290 to 46-294, the applicant shall, within sixty days
5 after the order of approval of the Chief Water Officer Department of
6 Natural Resources, cause copies of the following to be filed with the
7 county clerk or register of deeds of the county in which the land subject
8 to the appropriation prior to the transfer is located: (1) The permit by
9 which the appropriation was established; (2) the agreement by which the

24 appropriation continues to provide the beneficial uses for which the
25 permit was granted and that the appropriation is in the public interest.
26 After the hearing, the Chief Water Officer director may by order modify
27 or cancel, in whole or in part, the instream appropriation.

12 (6) If a ground water management area has been adopted by a district
13 under this section that includes one or more controls authorized by
14 subdivision (1)(f) or (1)(m) of section 46-739, the district may request
15 that the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources to conduct
16 an evaluation to determine if an immediate stay should be placed on the
17 issuance of new surface water natural-flow appropriations in the area,
18 river basin, subbasin, or reach of the management area, and the Chief
19 Water Officer department may determine that the stay is in the public
20 interest. The stay may include provisions for exceptions to be granted
21 for beneficial uses as described in subsection (3) of section 46-714 or
22 for a project that provides hydrological benefit to the area of the stay
23 and may include provisions that the stay may be rescinded based on new or
24 additional information that may become available.
25 Sec. 212. Section 46-713, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

27 46-713 (1)(a) By January 1 of each year beginning in 2006 and except
28 as otherwise provided in this section and section 46-720, the Chief Water
29 Officer Department of Natural Resources shall complete an evaluation of
30 the expected long-term availability of hydrologically connected water
31 supplies for both existing and new surface water uses and existing and
-213-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 new ground water uses in each of the state's river basins and shall issue
2 a report that describes the results of the evaluation. For purposes of
3 the evaluation and the report, a river basin may be divided into two or
4 more subbasins or reaches. A river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an
5 integrated management plan has been or is being developed pursuant to
6 sections 46-715 to 46-717 or pursuant to section 46-719 shall not be
7 evaluated unless it is being reevaluated as provided in subsection (2) of
8 this section. For each river basin, subbasin, or reach evaluated, the
9 report shall describe (i) the nature and extent of use of both surface
10 water and ground water in each river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the
11 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department
12 preliminarily considers surface water and ground water to be
13 hydrologically connected and the criteria used for that determination,
14 and (iii) the extent to which the then-current uses affect available
15 near-term and long-term water supplies. River basins, subbasins, and
16 reaches designated as overappropriated in accordance with subsection (4)
17 of this section shall not be evaluated by the Chief Water Officer
18 department. The Chief Water Officer department is not required to perform
19 an annual evaluation for a river basin, subbasin, or reach during the
20 four years following a status change in such river basin, subbasin, or
21 reach under subsection (12) of section 46-714.
22 (b) Based on the information reviewed in the evaluation process, the
23 Chief Water Officer department shall arrive at a preliminary conclusion
24 for each river basin, subbasin, and reach evaluated as to whether such
25 river basin, subbasin, or reach presently is fully appropriated without
26 the initiation of additional uses. The Chief Water Officer department
27 shall also determine if and how such preliminary conclusion would change
28 if no additional legal constraints were imposed on future development of
29 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water and reasonable
30 projections are made about the extent and location of future development
31 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach.

1 (c) In addition to the conclusion about whether a river basin,
2 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
3 department shall include in the report, for informational purposes only,
4 a summary of relevant data provided by any interested party concerning
5 the social, economic, and environmental impacts of additional
6 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water uses on resources
7 that are dependent on streamflow or ground water levels but are not
8 protected by appropriations or regulations.
9 (d) In preparing the report, the Chief Water Officer department
10 shall rely on the best scientific data, information, and methodologies
11 readily available to ensure that the conclusions and results contained in
12 the report are reliable. In its report, the Chief Water Officer
13 department shall provide sufficient documentation to allow these data,
14 information, methodologies, and conclusions to be independently
15 replicated and assessed. Upon request by the Chief Water Officer
16 department, state agencies, natural resources districts, irrigation
17 districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation districts,
18 mutual irrigation companies, canal companies, municipalities, and other
19 water users and stakeholders shall provide relevant data and information
20 in their possession. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
21 Resources shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific
22 data and other information that will be considered for making the
23 preliminary determinations required by this section.
24 (2)(a) The Chief Water Officer department shall complete a
25 reevaluation of a river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated
26 management plan has been or is being prepared if the Chief Water Officer
27 department has reason to believe that a reevaluation might lead to a
28 different determination about whether such river basin, subbasin, or
29 reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated. A decision to reevaluate
30 may be reached by the Chief Water Officer department on its own or in
31 response to a petition filed with the Chief Water Officer department by
-215-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 any interested person. To be considered sufficient to justify a
2 reevaluation, a petition shall be accompanied by supporting information
3 showing that (i) new scientific data or other information relevant to the
4 determination of whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
5 appropriated or overappropriated has become available since the last
6 evaluation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the Chief Water
7 Officer department relied on incorrect or incomplete information when the
8 river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated, or (iii) the Chief
9 Water Officer department erred in the its interpretation or application
10 of the information available when the river basin, subbasin, or reach was
11 last evaluated. If a petition determined by the Chief Water Officer
12 department to be sufficient is filed before July 1 of any year, the
13 reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved shall be
14 included in the next annual report prepared in accordance with subsection
15 (1) of this section. If any such petition is filed on or after July 1 of
16 any year, the Chief Water Officer department may defer the reevaluation
17 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved until the second annual
18 report after such filing.
19 (b) If the reevaluation results in a different determination by the
20 Chief Water Officer department, then (i) the Chief Water Officer
21 department shall notify, by certified mail, the affected natural
22 resources districts and any irrigation district, public power and
23 irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
24 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
25 subbasin, or reach of the preliminary change in the determination and
26 (ii) the Chief Water Officer department shall hold one or more public
27 hearings not more than ninety days after the publication of the notice
28 required in subdivision (b)(i) of this subsection. Notice of the hearings
29 shall be provided in the same manner as the notice required in subsection
30 (1) of section 46-714. Any interested person may appear at the hearing
31 and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
-216-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
2 (c) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subdivision (b)
3 of this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
4 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
5 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
6 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
7 (3) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed fully
8 appropriated if the Chief Water Officer department determines based upon
9 the its evaluation conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
10 and information presented at the hearing pursuant to subsection (4) of
11 section 46-714 that then-current uses of hydrologically connected surface
12 water and ground water in the river basin, subbasin, or reach cause or
13 will in the reasonably foreseeable future cause (a) the surface water
14 supply to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the beneficial or
15 useful purposes for which existing natural-flow or storage appropriations
16 were granted and the beneficial or useful purposes for which, at the time
17 of approval, any existing instream appropriation was granted, (b) the
18 streamflow to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the
19 beneficial uses from wells constructed in aquifers dependent on recharge
20 from the river or stream involved, or (c) reduction in the flow of a
21 river or stream sufficient to cause noncompliance by Nebraska with an
22 interstate compact or decree, other formal state contract or agreement,
23 or applicable state or federal laws.
24 (4)(a) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed
25 overappropriated if, on July 16, 2004, the river basin, subbasin, or
26 reach is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among three or
27 more states and if, prior to such date, the Chief Water Officer
28 department has declared a moratorium on the issuance of new surface water
29 appropriations in such river basin, subbasin, or reach and has requested
30 each natural resources district with jurisdiction in the affected area in
31 such river basin, subbasin, or reach either (i) to close or to continue

7 July 16, 2004, on the drilling of new water wells in all or part of such
8 river basin, subbasin, or reach.
9 (b) Within sixty days after July 16, 2004, the Chief Water Officer
10 department shall designate which river basins, subbasins, or reaches are
11 overappropriated. The designation shall include a description of the
12 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department has
13 determined that surface water and ground water are hydrologically
14 connected and the criteria used to make such determination.
15 Sec. 213. Section 46-714, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 46-714 (1) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
18 Resources makes a preliminary determination that a river basin, subbasin,
19 or reach not previously designated as overappropriated and not previously
20 determined to be fully appropriated has become fully appropriated, the
21 Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate stay on the
22 issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations
23 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer
24 department shall also provide prompt notice of such preliminary
25 determination to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to
26 each natural resources district that encompasses any of the geographic
27 area involved. Such notice to natural resources districts shall be by
28 certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the manager of the
29 natural resources district or his or her designee and shall include the
30 signature of the Chief Water Officer Director of Natural Resources.

1 district, there shall be a stay on issuance of water well construction
2 permits in the geographic area preliminarily determined by the Chief
3 Water Officer department to include hydrologically connected surface
4 water and ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief
5 Water Officer department shall also notify the public of the preliminary
6 determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
7 appropriated and of the affected geographic area. Such notice shall be
8 provided by publication once each week for three consecutive weeks in at
9 least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in such other newspaper
10 or newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
11 department to provide general circulation in the river basin, subbasin,
12 or reach.
13 (2) If the Chief Water Officer department preliminarily determines a
14 river basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated and has
15 identified the existence of hydrologically connected surface water and
16 ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach, stays shall also be
17 imposed:
18 (a) On the construction of any new water well in the area covered by
19 the determination unless a permit with conditions imposed by the natural
20 resources district has been issued prior to the determination. Such
21 conditions shall meet the objectives of subsection (4) of section 46-715
22 and may include, but are not limited to, conditions in accordance with
23 subsection (6) of section 46-739. Any well constructed pursuant to such
24 permit shall be completed in accordance with section 46-738; and
25 (b) On the use of an existing water well or an existing surface
26 water appropriation in the affected area to increase the number of acres
27 historically irrigated.
28 Such additional stays shall begin ten days after the first
29 publication, in a newspaper of statewide circulation, of the notice of
30 the preliminary determination that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is
31 fully appropriated.

12 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any stay imposed
13 pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall remain in
14 effect for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach until the Chief
15 Water Officer department has made a final determination regarding whether
16 the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated and, if the
17 Chief Water Officer's department's final determination is that the river
18 basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, shall remain in effect
19 as provided in subsection (11) of this section. Within the time period
20 between the dates of the preliminary and final determinations, the Chief
21 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
22 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public
23 power and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company,
24 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
25 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
26 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
27 resources districts. The Chief Water Officer department shall also hold
28 one or more public hearings not more than ninety days after the first
29 publication of the notice required by subsection (1) of this section.
30 Notice of the hearings shall be provided in the same manner as the notice
31 required by such subsection. Any interested person may appear at such
-221-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 hearing and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
2 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Chief
3 Water Officer's department's preliminary conclusions about the extent of
4 the area within which the surface water and ground water supplies for the
5 river basin, subbasin, or reach are determined to be hydrologically
6 connected, and whether the stays on new uses should be terminated.
7 (5) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subsection (4)
8 of this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
9 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
10 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
11 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach. If the final determination is
12 that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief
13 Water Officer department, at the same time, shall (a) decide whether to
14 continue or to terminate the stays on new surface water uses and on
15 increases in the number of surface water irrigated acres and (b)
16 designate the geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer
17 department considers surface water and ground water to be hydrologically
18 connected in the river basin, subbasin, or reach and describe the methods
19 and criteria used in making that determination. The Chief Water Officer
20 department shall provide notice of its decision to continue or terminate
21 the stays in the same manner as the notice required by subsection (1) of
22 this section.
23 (6) Within ninety days after a final determination by the Chief
24 Water Officer department that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
25 appropriated, an affected natural resources district may hold one or more
26 public hearings on the question of whether the stays on the issuance of
27 new water well permits, on the construction of new water wells, or on
28 increases in ground water irrigated acres should be terminated. Notice of
29 the hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
30 (7) Within forty-five days after a natural resources district's
31 final hearing pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the natural
-222-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 resources district shall decide (a) whether to terminate the stay on new
2 water wells in all or part of the natural resources district subject to
3 the stay and (b) whether to terminate the stay on increases in ground
4 water irrigated acres. If the natural resources district decides not to
5 terminate the stay on new water wells in any geographic area, it shall
6 also decide whether to exempt from such stay the construction of water
7 wells for which permits were issued prior to the issuance of the stay but
8 for which construction had not begun prior to issuance of the stay. If
9 construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior to the
10 stay is allowed, all permits that were valid when the stay went into
11 effect shall be extended by a time period equal to the length of the
12 stay.
13 (8) Whenever the Chief Water Officer department designates a river
14 basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, each previously declared
15 moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in the
16 river basin, subbasin, or reach shall continue in effect. The Chief Water
17 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of such designation
18 to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to each natural
19 resources district that encompasses any of the geographic area involved.
20 Immediately upon receipt of such notice by a natural resources district,
21 there shall be a stay on the issuance of new water well construction
22 permits in any portion of such natural resources district that is within
23 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
24 department. The Chief Water Officer department shall also notify the
25 public of its designation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach as
26 overappropriated and of the geographic area involved in such designation.
27 Such notice shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks
28 in at least one newspaper of statewide circulation and in such other
29 newspapers as are deemed appropriate by the Chief Water Officer
30 department to provide general notice in the river basin, subbasin, or
31 reach.

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (9) Beginning ten days after the first publication of notice under
2 subsection (8) of this section in a newspaper of statewide circulation,
3 there shall also be stays (a) on the construction of any new water well
4 in the hydrologically connected area if such construction has not
5 commenced prior to such date and if no permit for construction of the
6 water well has been issued previously by either the Chief Water Officer
7 department or the natural resources district, (b) on the use of an
8 existing water well in the hydrologically connected area to increase the
9 number of acres historically irrigated, and (c) on the use of an existing
10 surface water appropriation to increase the number of acres historically
11 irrigated in the affected area.
12 (10) Within ninety days after a designation by the Chief Water
13 Officer department of a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
14 overappropriated, a natural resources district that encompasses any of
15 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
16 department may hold one or more public hearings on the question of
17 whether to terminate the stays on (a) the construction of new water wells
18 within all or part of its portion of the hydrologically connected area,
19 (b) the issuance of new water well construction permits in such area, or
20 (c) the increase in ground water irrigated acres in such area. Notice of
21 any hearing for such purpose shall be provided pursuant to section
22 46-743. Prior to the scheduling of a natural resources district hearing
23 on the question of whether to terminate any such stay, the Chief Water
24 Officer department and the affected natural resources district shall
25 consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
26 and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
27 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
29 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
30 resources district.
31 (11) Any stay issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect

1 until (a) the stay has been terminated pursuant to subsection (5), (7),
2 or (10) of this section, (b) an integrated management plan for the
3 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Chief
4 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts and
5 has taken effect, (c) an integrated management plan for the affected
6 river basin, subbasin, or reach has been adopted by the Interrelated
7 Water Review Board and has taken effect, (d) the Chief Water Officer
8 department has completed a reevaluation pursuant to subsection (2) of
9 section 46-713 and has determined that the affected river basin,
10 subbasin, or reach is not fully appropriated or overappropriated, or (e)
11 the stay expires pursuant to this subsection. Such stay may be imposed
12 initially for not more than three years following the Chief Water
13 Officer's department's designation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach
14 as overappropriated or the Chief Water Officer's department's final
15 determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
16 appropriated and may be extended thereafter on an annual basis by
17 agreement of the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
18 resources district for not more than two additional years if necessary to
19 allow the development, adoption, and implementation of an integrated
20 management plan pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-719.
21 (12)(a) For purposes of this subsection, (i) a status change occurs
22 when a preliminary or final determination that a river basin, subbasin,
23 or reach is fully appropriated is reversed by the Chief Water Officer
24 department or by judicial determination and such river basin, subbasin,
25 or reach is determined not to be fully appropriated and (ii) the
26 hydrologically connected area means the geographic area within which the
27 Chief Water Officer department considers surface water and ground water
28 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach to be hydrologically connected.
29 (b) If a status change occurs, any stays previously in force by the
30 Chief Water Officer department or affected natural resources districts
31 shall remain in force until the stays imposed under this subsection are
-225-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 in place and the Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate
2 stay on the issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use
3 appropriations in the river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water
4 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of the status change
5 in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. Immediately upon
6 receipt of the notice by the affected natural resources district, there
7 shall be stays imposed as set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this
8 section, subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (3) of this
9 section. The stays imposed pursuant to this subsection shall remain in
10 effect within each affected natural resources district until such
11 district adopts rules and regulations in accordance with subdivision (c),
12 (d), or (e) of this subsection.
13 (c) Upon receipt of notice of a status change, each affected natural
14 resources district shall adopt rules and regulations within one hundred
15 twenty days after receipt of such notice for the prioritization and
16 granting of water well permits within the hydrologically connected area
17 for the four-year period following the status change. Nothing in this
18 subsection shall be construed to supersede the authority provided to
19 natural resources districts under subsection (2) of section 46-707 and
20 subdivisions (1)(f) and (1)(m) of section 46-739.
21 (d) The rules and regulations adopted by each affected natural
22 resources district in accordance with subdivision (c) of this subsection
23 shall (i) allow a limited number of total new ground water irrigated
24 acres annually, (ii) be created with the purpose of maintaining the
25 status of not fully appropriated based on the most recent basin
26 determination, (iii) be for a term of not less than four years, and (iv)
27 limit the number of new permits so that total new ground water irrigated
28 acres do not exceed the number set in the rules and regulations. The
29 Chief Water Officer department shall approve the proposed new number of
30 ground water irrigated acres within sixty days after approval by the
31 natural resources district if such district meets the conditions set
-226-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 forth in subdivision (d)(ii) of this subsection, based on the most recent
2 basin determination.
3 (e) If the proposed new number of acres is not approved by the Chief
4 Water Officer department within the applicable time period as provided in
5 subdivision (d) of this subsection, the affected natural resources
6 districts shall adopt rules and regulations that allow water well permits
7 to be issued that will result in no more than two thousand five hundred
8 irrigated acres or that will result in an increase of not more than
9 twenty percent of all historically irrigated acres within the
10 hydrologically connected area of each natural resources district within
11 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, whichever is less, for each
12 calendar year of the four-year period following the date of the
13 determination described in this subsection. Each affected natural
14 resources district may, after the initial four-year period has expired,
15 annually determine whether water well permit limitations should continue
16 and may enforce such limitations.
17 (f) During the four-year period following the status change, the
18 Chief Water Officer department shall ensure that any new appropriation
19 granted will not cause the basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully
20 appropriated based on the most recent basin determination. The Chief
21 Water Officer department, pursuant to its rules and regulations adopted
22 and promulgated under the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection
23 Act, shall not issue new natural flow surface water appropriations for
24 irrigation, within the river basin, subbasin, or reach affected by the
25 status change, that will result in a net increase of more than eight
26 hundred thirty-four irrigated acres in each natural resources district
27 during each calendar year of the four-year period following the date of
28 the determination described in this subsection.
29 Sec. 214. Section 46-715, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 46-715 (1)(a) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
-227-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 Resources has designated a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
2 overappropriated or has made a final determination that a river basin,
3 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the natural resources districts
4 encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach and the Chief Water
5 Officer department shall jointly develop an integrated management plan
6 for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The plan shall be completed,
7 adopted, and take effect within three years after such designation or
8 final determination unless the Chief Water Officer department and the
9 natural resources districts jointly agree to an extension of not more
10 than two additional years.
11 (b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin,
12 subbasin, or reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or
13 has not been finally determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly
14 with the Chief Water Officer department, develop an integrated management
15 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach located within the
16 district. The district shall notify the Chief Water Officer department of
17 its intention to develop an integrated management plan which shall be
18 developed and adopted according to sections 46-715 to 46-717 and
19 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-718. The objective of an integrated
20 management plan under this subdivision is to manage such river basin,
21 subbasin, or reach to achieve and sustain a balance between water uses
22 and water supplies for the long term. If a district develops an
23 integrated management plan under this subdivision and the Chief Water
24 Officer department subsequently determines the affected river basin,
25 subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
26 department and the affected natural resources district may amend the
27 integrated management plan.
28 (2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects of
29 existing and potential new water uses on existing surface water
30 appropriators and ground water users shall be considered. An integrated
31 management plan shall include the following: (a) Clear goals and
-228-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 objectives with a purpose of sustaining a balance between water uses and
2 water supplies so that the economic viability, social and environmental
3 health, safety, and welfare of the river basin, subbasin, or reach can be
4 achieved and maintained for both the near term and the long term; (b) a
5 map clearly delineating the geographic area subject to the integrated
6 management plan; (c) one or more of the ground water controls authorized
7 for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant to section 46-739;
8 (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized for adoption by
9 the Chief Water Officer department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a
10 plan to gather and evaluate data, information, and methodologies that
11 could be used to implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase
12 understanding of the surface water and hydrologically connected ground
13 water system, and test the validity of the conclusions and information
14 upon which the integrated management plan is based. The plan may also
15 provide for utilization of any applicable incentive programs authorized
16 by law. Nothing in the integrated management plan for a fully
17 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach shall require a natural
18 resources district to regulate ground water uses in place at the time of
19 the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary determination that the
20 river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, unless such
21 regulation is necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of a basin-
22 wide plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a natural resources district
23 may voluntarily adopt such regulations. The applicable natural resources
24 district may decide to include all water users within the district
25 boundary in an integrated management plan.
26 (3) In order to provide a process for economic development
27 opportunities and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin,
28 or reach, the integrated management plan shall include clear and
29 transparent procedures to track depletions and gains to streamflows
30 resulting from new, retired, or other changes to uses within the river
31 basin, subbasin, or reach. The procedures shall:
-229-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the best
2 available information, data, and science;
3 (b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized to
4 estimate depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes
5 location, amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to
6 new uses;
7 (c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not have
8 more than a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground
9 water users;
10 (d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and the Chief
11 Water Officer department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share
12 information on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting
13 water use in the river basin, subbasin, or reach;
14 (e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available to
15 mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
16 interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use
17 management, and use retirement;
18 (f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans after
19 consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
20 districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts,
21 municipalities, other political subdivisions, and other water users to
22 make water available for offset to enhance and encourage economic
23 development opportunities and economic sustainability in the river basin,
24 subbasin, or reach; and
25 (g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses shall
26 take to apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.
27 Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment of an
28 integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.
29 (4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed for
30 adoption in the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1) of
31 this section shall, when considered together and with any applicable
-230-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 incentive programs, (a) be consistent with the goals and objectives of
2 the plan, (b) be sufficient to ensure that the state will remain in
3 compliance with applicable state and federal laws and with any applicable
4 interstate water compact or decree or other formal state contract or
5 agreement pertaining to surface water or ground water use or supplies,
6 and (c) protect the ground water users whose water wells are dependent on
7 recharge from the river or stream involved and the surface water
8 appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion caused by
9 surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a river
10 basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily
11 determined to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713,
12 after the date of such designation or preliminary determination.
13 (5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
14 overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more
15 natural resources districts, the Chief Water Officer department and the
16 affected natural resources districts shall jointly develop a basin-wide
17 plan for the area designated as overappropriated. Such plan shall be
18 developed using the consultation and collaboration process described in
19 subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be developed concurrently with
20 the development of the integrated management plan required pursuant to
21 subsections (1) through (4) of this section, and shall be designed to
22 achieve, in the incremental manner described in subdivision (d) of this
23 subsection, the goals and objectives described in subsection (2) of this
24 section. The basin-wide plan shall be adopted after hearings by the Chief
25 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
26 (b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
27 overappropriated and subject to this subsection, the Chief Water Officer
28 department and each natural resources district encompassing such river
29 basin, subbasin, or reach shall jointly develop an integrated management
30 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach pursuant to subsections (1)
31 through (4) of this section. Each integrated management plan for a river
-231-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 basin, subbasin, or reach subject to this subsection shall be consistent
2 with any basin-wide plan developed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
3 subsection. Such integrated management plan shall be developed after
4 consultation and collaboration with irrigation districts, reclamation
5 districts, public power and irrigation districts, mutual irrigation
6 companies, canal companies, and municipalities that rely on water from
7 within the affected area and that, after being notified of the
8 commencement of the plan development process, indicate in writing their
9 desire to participate in such process. In addition, the Chief Water
10 Officer department or the affected natural resources districts may
11 include designated representatives of other stakeholders. If agreement is
12 reached by all parties involved in such consultation and collaboration
13 process, the Chief Water Officer department and each natural resources
14 district shall adopt the agreed-upon integrated management plan. If
15 agreement cannot be reached by all parties involved, the integrated
16 management plan shall be developed and adopted by the Chief Water Officer
17 department and the affected natural resources district pursuant to
18 sections 46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board
19 pursuant to section 46-719.
20 (c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
21 shall identify the overall difference between the current and fully
22 appropriated levels of development. Such determination shall take into
23 account cyclical supply, including drought, identify the portion of the
24 overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
25 development that is due to conservation measures, and identify the
26 portions of the overall difference between the current and fully
27 appropriated levels of development that are due to water use initiated
28 prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated on or after such date.
29 (d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
30 shall adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives
31 identified under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following
-232-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 steps:
2 (i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact of
3 streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water
4 wells constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to
5 the extent those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1,
6 1997, and, unless an interstate cooperative agreement for such river
7 basin, subbasin, or reach is no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow
8 depletions that would cause noncompliance by Nebraska with such
9 interstate cooperative agreement. During the first increment, the Chief
10 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
11 shall also pursue voluntary efforts, subject to the availability of
12 funds, to offset any increase in streamflow depletive effects that occur
13 after July 1, 1997, but are caused by ground water uses initiated prior
14 to such date. The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
15 resources districts may also use other appropriate and authorized
16 measures for such purpose;
17 (ii) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
18 resources districts may amend an integrated management plan subject to
19 this subsection (5) as necessary based on an annual review of the
20 progress being made toward achieving the goals for that increment;
21 (iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated
22 management plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten
23 years after the adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated
24 management plan pursuant to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the
25 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
26 district shall conduct a technical analysis of the actions taken in such
27 increment to determine the progress towards meeting the goals and
28 objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The
29 analysis shall include an examination of (A) available supplies and
30 changes in long-term availability, (B) the effects of conservation
31 practices and natural causes, including, but not limited to, drought, and
-233-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (C) the effects of the plan on reducing the overall difference between
2 the current and fully appropriated levels of development identified in
3 subdivision (5)(c) of this section. The analysis shall determine whether
4 a subsequent increment is necessary in the integrated management plan to
5 meet the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this
6 section and reduce the overall difference between the current and fully
7 appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of
8 this section;
9 (iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii) of this
10 subsection, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
11 resources districts, utilizing the consultative and collaborative process
12 described in subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall if necessary
13 identify goals for a subsequent increment of the integrated management
14 plan. Subsequent increments shall be completed, adopted, and take effect
15 not more than ten years after adoption of the previous increment; and
16 (v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii)
17 through (iv) of this subsection shall be repeated until the Chief Water
18 Officer department and the affected natural resources districts agree
19 that the goals and objectives identified pursuant to subsection (2) of
20 this section have been met and the overall difference between the current
21 and fully appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision
22 (5)(c) of this section has been addressed so that the river basin,
23 subbasin, or reach has returned to a fully appropriated condition.
24 (6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
25 fully appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure
26 that the state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a
27 formal state contract or agreement, the Chief Water Officer department,
28 in consultation with the affected districts, shall forecast on an annual
29 basis the maximum amount of water that may be available from streamflow
30 for beneficial use in the short term and long term in order to comply
31 with the requirement of subdivision (4)(b) of this section. This forecast
-234-
ER36 ER36

1 shall be made by January 1, 2008, and each January 1 thereafter.
2 Sec. 215. Section 46-716, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 46-716 (1) The surface water controls that may be included in an
5 integrated management plan and may be adopted by the Chief Water Officer
6 Department of Natural Resources are: (a) Increased monitoring and
7 enforcement of surface water diversion rates and amounts diverted
8 annually; (b) the prohibition or limitation of additional surface water
9 appropriations; (c) requirements for surface water appropriators to apply
10 or utilize reasonable conservation measures consistent with good
11 husbandry and other requirements of section 46-231 and consistent with
12 reasonable reliance by other surface water or ground water users on
13 return flows or on seepage to the aquifer; and (d) other reasonable
14 restrictions on surface water use which are consistent with the intent of
15 section 46-715 and the requirements of section 46-231.
16 (2) If during the development of the integrated management plan the
17 Chief Water Officer department determines that surface water
18 appropriators should be required to apply or utilize conservation
19 measures or that other reasonable restrictions on surface water use need
20 to be imposed, the Chief Water Officer's department's portion of the
21 integrated management plan shall allow the affected surface water
22 appropriators and surface water project sponsors a reasonable amount of
23 time, not to exceed one hundred eighty days unless extended by the Chief
24 Water Officer department, to identify the conservation measures to be
25 applied or utilized, to develop a schedule for such application and
26 utilization, and to comment on any other proposed restrictions.
27 Sec. 216. Section 46-717, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-717 (1) In developing an integrated management plan, the Chief

1 information available and shall review and consider any rules and
2 regulations in effect in any existing ground water management area that
3 encompasses all or part of the geographic area to be encompassed by the
4 plan. Consideration shall be given to the applicable scientific data and
5 other information relied upon by the Chief Water Officer department in
6 preparing the annual report required by section 46-713 and to other types
7 of data and information that may be deemed appropriate by the Chief Water
8 Officer department. The Chief Water Officer department, after seeking
9 input from the affected natural resources districts, shall specify by
10 rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other information
11 that will be considered in developing an integrated management plan. The
12 natural resources districts shall adopt similar rules and regulations
13 specifying the types of scientific data and other information necessary
14 for purposes of this section. Existing research, data, studies, or any
15 other relevant information which has been compiled by or is in possession
16 of other state or federal agencies, other natural resources districts,
17 and other political subdivisions within the State of Nebraska shall be
18 utilized. State agencies and political subdivisions shall furnish
19 information or data upon request of the Chief Water Officer department or
20 any affected natural resources district. Neither the Chief Water Officer
21 department nor the natural resources districts shall be required to
22 conduct new research or to develop new computer models to prepare an
23 integrated management plan, but such new research may be conducted or new
24 computer models developed within the limits of available funding if the
25 additional information is desired by the Chief Water Officer department
26 or the affected natural resources districts.
27 (2) During preparation of an integrated management plan for a fully
28 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach or of an integrated
29 management plan under subdivision (1)(b) of section 46-715, the Chief
30 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
31 shall consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public

2 or municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
3 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
4 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or by the affected
5 natural resources districts. They shall also actively solicit public
6 comments and opinions through public meetings and other means.
7 Sec. 217. Section 46-718, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
8 amended to read:
9 46-718 (1) If the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
10 Resources and the affected natural resources districts preparing an
11 integrated management plan reach agreement on (a) the proposed goals and
12 objectives of the plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach,
13 (b) the proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (c) the
14 surface water and ground water controls and any incentive programs that
15 are proposed for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
16 subbasin, or reach, they shall schedule one or more public hearings to
17 take testimony on the proposed integrated management plan and the
18 proposed controls. Such hearings shall be held within forty-five days
19 after reaching agreement and within or in reasonable proximity to the
20 area to be affected by implementation of the integrated management plan.
21 Notice of such hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
22 The costs of publishing the notice shall be shared between the Chief
23 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
24 All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present testimony
25 or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being considered.
26 (2) Within sixty days after the final hearing under this section,
27 the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
28 districts shall jointly decide whether to implement the plan proposed,
29 with or without modifications, and whether to adopt and implement the
30 surface water and ground water controls and incentive programs proposed
31 in the plan. If the Chief Water Officer department and the natural

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 resources districts agree to implement the plan and to adopt and
2 implement the proposed controls, the natural resources districts shall by
3 order designate a ground water management area for integrated management
4 or, if the geographic area subject to the integrated management plan is
5 already in a ground water management area, the order shall designate an
6 integrated management subarea for that area. The order shall include a
7 geographic and stratigraphic definition of the ground water management
8 area or integrated management subarea and shall adopt the controls in the
9 integrated management plan that are authorized for adoption by the
10 natural resources district pursuant to section 46-739. The Chief Water
11 Officer department shall by order adopt the controls in the integrated
12 management plan that are authorized for adoption by the Chief Water
13 Officer department pursuant to section 46-716. Neither the controls
14 adopted by the district nor those adopted by the Chief Water Officer
15 department shall include controls substantially different from those set
16 forth in the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water
17 management area or an integrated management subarea by the natural
18 resources district shall not include any area that was not identified in
19 the notice of the hearing as within the area proposed to be subject to
20 the controls in the plan. The Chief Water Officer department and the
21 natural resources district shall each cause a copy of their respective
22 orders its order to be published in the manner provided in section
23 46-744.
24 (3) If at any time during the development of a basin-wide plan or an
25 integrated management plan either the Chief Water Officer department or
26 the affected natural resources districts conclude that the parties will
27 be unable to reach a timely agreement on the basin-wide plan or on (a)
28 the goals and objectives of the integrated management plan for the
29 affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, (b) the geographic area to be
30 subject to controls, or (c) the surface water or ground water controls or

2 testimony or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being
3 considered.
4 (c) Within forty-five days after the final hearing pursuant to
5 subdivision (b) of this subsection, the Interrelated Water Review Board
6 shall by order, as applicable, adopt a basin-wide plan or an integrated
7 management plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach and, in
8 the case of an integrated management plan, shall designate a ground water
9 management area for integrated management or an integrated management
10 subarea for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. An integrated
11 management plan shall be consistent with subsection (2) of section
12 46-715, and the surface water and ground water controls and any
13 applicable incentive programs adopted as part of that plan shall be
14 consistent with subsection (4) of section 46-715. The controls adopted by
15 the board shall not be substantially different from those described in
16 the notice of hearing. The area designated as a ground water management
17 area or an integrated management subarea shall not include any area that
18 was not identified in the notice of the hearing as within the area
19 proposed to be subject to the controls in the plan.
20 (d) The order adopted under this subsection shall be published in
21 the manner prescribed in section 46-744.
22 (e) Surface water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water Review
23 Board shall be implemented and enforced by the Chief Water Officer
24 department. Ground water controls adopted by the Interrelated Water
25 Review Board shall be implemented and enforced by the affected natural
26 resources districts.
27 (3) Whether an integrated management plan is adopted pursuant to
28 section 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board pursuant to
29 subsection (2) of this section, the Chief Water Officer department or a
30 natural resources district responsible in part for implementation and
31 enforcement of an integrated management plan may propose modification of
-241-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 the goals or objectives of that plan, of the area subject to the plan, or
2 of the surface water controls, ground water controls, or incentive
3 programs adopted to implement the plan. The Chief Water Officer
4 department and the affected natural resources districts shall utilize the
5 procedures in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement
6 on and to adopt and implement proposed modifications. If agreement on
7 such modifications cannot be achieved utilizing those procedures, either
8 the Chief Water Officer department or an affected natural resources
9 district may notify the Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water
10 Review Board shall be appointed and convened in accordance with
11 subsection (1) of this section to resolve the dispute and, if applicable,
12 to adopt any modifications utilizing the procedures in subsection (2) of
13 this section.
14 (4) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
15 resources districts may also raise objections concerning the
16 implementation or enforcement of previously adopted surface water or
17 ground water controls. The Chief Water Officer department and the
18 affected natural resources districts shall utilize the procedures in
19 sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement on such
20 implementation or enforcement issues. If agreement on such issues cannot
21 be achieved utilizing such procedures, either the Chief Water Officer
22 department or an affected natural resources district may notify the
23 Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
24 appointed and convened in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
25 After permitting each party to fully express the its reasons for the its
26 position taken by each party on the disputed issues, the board may either
27 take no action or conclude (a) that one or more parties needs to modify
28 the party's its approach to implementation or enforcement and direct that
29 such modifications take place or (b) that one or more parties either has
30 not made a good faith effort to implement or enforce the portion of the
31 plan or controls for which the party it is responsible or is unable to
-242-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 fully implement and enforce such portion and that such party's
2 jurisdiction with respect to implementation and enforcement of the plan
3 and controls shall be terminated and reassigned to one or more of the
4 other parties responsible for implementation and enforcement. A decision
5 by the Interrelated Water Review Board to terminate and reassign
6 jurisdiction of any portion of the plan or controls shall take effect
7 immediately upon that decision. Notice of such reassignment shall be
8 published at least once in one or more newspapers as necessary to provide
9 general circulation in the area affected by such reassignment.
10 (5) The board may be reconvened in accordance with subsection (1) of
11 this section at a later date upon request to the Governor by the party
12 for which jurisdiction for implementation and enforcement was terminated
13 if such party desires to have the party's its jurisdiction reinstated,
14 but no such request shall be honored until at least one year after the
15 termination and not more than once per year thereafter. The board may
16 reinstate jurisdiction to that party only upon a clear showing by such
17 party that the party it is willing and able to fully implement and
18 enforce the plan and any applicable controls. Notice that a party's
19 jurisdiction has been reinstated shall be provided in the same manner
20 that notice of the earlier termination was given.
21 Sec. 219. Section 46-720, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-720 (1) The Legislature finds that, prior to July 16, 2004,
24 actions were taken by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed
25 prior to July 1, 2025, and by one or more natural resources districts
26 pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed immediately prior
27 to July 16, 2004 such date, for the purpose of addressing circumstances
28 that are, after July 16, 2004 such date, to be addressed in accordance
29 with sections 46-713 to 46-719. It is the intent of the Legislature that
30 actions taken pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed
31 immediately prior to July 16, 2004, should not be negated and that
-243-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 transition from the authorities and responsibilities granted by such
2 section to those granted by sections 46-713 to 46-719 should occur in as
3 efficient a manner as possible. Such transition shall be therefor
4 governed by subsections (2) through (5) of this section, and all
5 references in such subsections to section 46-656.28 shall be construed to
6 mean section 46-656.28 as such section existed immediately prior to July
7 16, 2004.
8 (2) If, prior to July 16, 2004, (a) a natural resources district
9 requested pursuant to subsection (1) of section 46-656.28 that affected
10 appropriators, affected surface water project sponsors, and the
11 department consult and that studies and a hearing be held but (b) the
12 Director of Natural Resources, as such position existed, had has not made
13 a preliminary determination relative to that request pursuant to
14 subsection (2) of section 46-656.28, no further action on the district's
15 request shall be required of the department. If under the same
16 circumstances a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain water
17 wells has been imposed by the district pursuant to subsection (16) of
18 section 46-656.28 and remains in effect immediately prior to July 16,
19 2004, such temporary suspension shall remain in effect for thirty days
20 after the department issues its first annual report under section 46-713,
21 except that (i) such temporary suspension shall not apply to water wells
22 for which a permit has been obtained pursuant to the Municipal and Rural
23 Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act and (ii) to the extent any
24 such temporary suspension is in effect for all or part of a
25 hydrologically connected area for a river basin, subbasin, or reach
26 designated as overappropriated by the department, such temporary
27 suspension shall remain in effect only until it is superseded by the
28 stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section 46-714. To
29 the extent that any such temporary suspension applies to a geographic
30 area preliminarily considered by the department to have ground water
31 hydrologically connected to the surface water of a fully appropriated
-244-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 river basin, subbasin, or reach, such temporary suspension shall be
2 superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of
3 section 46-714.
4 (3)(a) If prior to July 16, 2004, (i) the director has made a
5 preliminary determination pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28
6 that there is reason to believe that the use of hydrologically connected
7 ground water and surface water in a specific geographic area is
8 contributing to or is in the reasonably foreseeable future likely to
9 contribute to any conflict, dispute, or difficulty listed in such
10 subsection, (ii) the director has not made a determination pursuant to
11 subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint action plan should not
12 be prepared, and (iii) preparation of a joint action plan pursuant to
13 subsections (5) through (9) of such section has not been completed, the
14 geographic area involved shall become subject to sections 46-713 to
15 46-719 on July 16, 2004, and the department need not evaluate such
16 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
17 46-713.
18 (b) For purposes of this subsection and section 46-714 and except as
19 otherwise provided in this section, (i) July 16, 2004, shall result in
20 the imposition in any geographic area subject to this subsection of the
21 stays required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714, (ii) such
22 stays shall be imposed in the manner required by such section, and (iii)
23 July 16, 2004, shall be treated as if it were the date of a departmental
24 preliminary determination pursuant to section 46-713 that such area is a
25 geographic area within which ground water and surface water of a fully
26 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach are hydrologically
27 connected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if a
28 temporary suspension in the drilling of certain new water wells has
29 previously been imposed by the affected natural resources district, (A)
30 the stays on construction of new water wells and on the increase in
31 ground water irrigated acres shall be limited in geographic extent to
-245-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 only that part of the affected area within which the temporary suspension
2 was in effect unless the director determines that inclusion of additional
3 area is necessary because ground water and surface water are
4 hydrologically connected in such additional area and (B) the stays on
5 construction of certain new water wells shall not apply to a water well
6 constructed in accordance with the terms of a water well construction
7 permit approved by the district prior to July 16, 2004, unless such well
8 was subject to the district's temporary suspension. If, prior to July 16,
9 2004, the director has held a hearing on a report issued pursuant to
10 subsection (3) of section 46-656.28 but has not yet determined whether a
11 joint action plan should be prepared, no departmental hearing shall be
12 required pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 before a final
13 determination is made about whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach
14 involved is fully appropriated. If, prior to July 16, 2004, the director
15 has determined pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a
16 joint action plan should be prepared, such determination shall have the
17 same effect as a final departmental determination pursuant to subsection
18 (5) of section 46-714 that the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach
19 is fully appropriated and no separate determination to that effect shall
20 be required. If, after July 16, 2004, the department determines that all
21 or part of the area subject to this subsection is in an overappropriated
22 river basin, subbasin, or reach, that portion of the area shall
23 thereafter be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Ground Water
24 Management and Protection Act applicable to an overappropriated river
25 basin, subbasin, or reach and stays that have previously taken effect in
26 accordance with this subsection shall continue in effect as stays for an
27 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach without additional
28 action or publication of notice by the department. Any temporary
29 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells that has been imposed
30 in the geographic area involved by a natural resources district pursuant
31 to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28 prior to July 16, 2004, shall
-246-

1 remain in effect until superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to
2 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714.
3 (4) If, prior to July 16, 2004, preparation of a joint action plan
4 has been completed pursuant to subsections (5) through (9) of section
5 46-656.28 but the plan has not yet been adopted pursuant to subsection
6 (11) of such section, the department need not evaluate the affected
7 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
8 46-713. The department and the affected natural resources district shall
9 review the completed joint action plan for its compliance with sections
10 46-715 to 46-717. If the joint action plan is determined to be in
11 compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 or if agreement is reached on
12 the revisions necessary to bring it into such compliance, the department
13 and the district shall adopt the plan and implement the controls as
14 provided in section 46-718. If the joint action plan is determined not to
15 be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 and agreement on the
16 proposed plan or the proposed controls cannot be reached pursuant to
17 section 46-718, section 46-719 shall apply. Except to the extent that any
18 portion of the affected area is designated as all or part of an
19 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach, any temporary
20 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells imposed in the affected
21 geographic area by a natural resources district pursuant to subsection
22 (16) of section 46-656.28 shall remain in effect until (a) the department
23 and the affected district have jointly decided to implement the plan,
24 with or without modifications, and controls have been adopted and taken
25 effect or (b) the Interrelated Water Review Board, pursuant to section
26 46-719, has adopted an integrated management plan for the affected river
27 basin, subbasin, or reach and the controls adopted by the board have
28 taken effect. To the extent that any portion of the affected area is
29 designated as all or part of an overappropriated river basin, subbasin,
30 or reach, any temporary suspension in the drilling of water wells shall
31 be superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of

3 and implemented pursuant to subsections (10) through (12) of section
4 46-656.28 and is in effect immediately prior to such date, the department
5 need not evaluate the geographic area subject to the plan in the
6 department's first annual report issued pursuant to section 46-713. For
7 purposes of the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act, (a)
8 the plan adopted shall be considered an integrated management plan
9 adopted pursuant to section 46-718, (b) the management area designated
10 shall be considered an integrated management area or subarea designated
11 pursuant to section 46-718, and (c) the controls adopted shall be
12 considered controls adopted pursuant to section 46-718 and shall remain
13 in effect until amended or repealed pursuant to section 46-718 or 46-719.

17 district's considerations shall include, but not be limited to, whether
18 it reasonably appears that such action will mitigate or eliminate the
19 condition which led to designation of the management area or will improve
20 the administration of the area.
21 (3) Upon request by the district or when any of the controls being
22 proposed are for the purpose of integrated management of hydrologically
23 connected ground water and surface water, the Chief Water Officer
24 Director of Natural Resources shall review and comment on the adoption,
25 amendment, or repeal of any authorized control in a management area. The
26 Chief Water Officer director may hold a public hearing to consider
27 testimony regarding the control prior to commenting on the adoption,
28 amendment, or repeal of the control. The Chief Water Officer director
29 shall consult with the district and fix a time, place, and date for such
30 hearing. In reviewing and commenting on an authorized control in a
31 management area, the Chief Water Officer's director's considerations

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 shall include, but not be limited to, those enumerated in subsection (2)
2 of this section.
3 (4) If because of varying ground water uses, varying surface water
4 uses, different irrigation distribution systems, or varying climatic,
5 hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions existing within a management
6 area the uniform application throughout such area of one or more controls
7 would fail to carry out the intent of the Nebraska Ground Water
8 Management and Protection Act in a reasonably effective and equitable
9 manner, the controls adopted by the district pursuant to this section may
10 contain different provisions for different categories of ground water use
11 or portions of the management area which differ from each other because
12 of varying climatic, hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions. Any
13 differences in such provisions shall recognize and be directed toward
14 such varying ground water uses or varying conditions. Except as otherwise
15 provided in this section, if the district adopts different controls for
16 different categories of ground water use, those controls shall be
17 consistent with section 46-613 and shall, for each such category, be
18 uniform for all portions of the area which have substantially similar
19 climatic, hydrologic, geologic, and soil conditions.
20 (5) The district may establish different water allocations for
21 different irrigation distribution systems.
22 (6)(a) The district may establish different provisions for different
23 hydrologic relationships between ground water and surface water.
24 (b) For management areas a purpose of which is the integrated
25 management of hydrologically connected ground water and surface water,
26 the district may establish different provisions for water wells either
27 permitted or constructed before the designation of a management area for
28 integrated management of hydrologically connected ground water and
29 surface water and for water wells either permitted or constructed on or
30 after the designation date or any other later date or dates established
31 by the district. Permits for construction of new wells not completed by

1 the date of the determination of fully appropriated shall be subject to
2 any conditions imposed by the applicable natural resources district.
3 (c) For a management area in a river basin or part of a river basin
4 that is or was the subject of litigation over an interstate water compact
5 or decree in which the State of Nebraska is a named defendant, the
6 district may establish different provisions for restriction of water
7 wells constructed after January 1, 2001, if such litigation was commenced
8 before or on May 22, 2001. If such litigation is commenced after May 22,
9 2001, the district may establish different provisions for restriction of
10 water wells constructed after the date on which such litigation is
11 commenced in federal court. An appeal from a decision of the district
12 under this subdivision shall be in accordance with the hearing procedures
13 established in the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act.
14 (d) Except as otherwise authorized by law, the district shall make a
15 replacement water well as defined in section 46-602, or as further
16 defined in district rules and regulations, subject to the same provisions
17 as the water well it replaces.
18 (7) If the district has included controls delineated in subdivision
19 (1)(m) of this section in its management plan, but has not implemented
20 such controls within two years after the initial public hearing on the
21 controls, the district shall hold a public hearing, as provided in
22 section 46-712, regarding the controls before implementing them.
23 (8) In addition to the controls listed in subsection (1) of this
24 section, a district in which a management area has been designated may
25 also adopt and implement one or more of the following measures if it
26 determines that any such measures would help the district and water users
27 achieve the goals and objectives of the management area: (a) It may
28 sponsor nonmandatory educational programs; and (b) it may establish and
29 implement financial or other incentive programs. As a condition for
30 participation in an incentive program, the district may require water
31 users or landowners to enter into and perform such agreements or
-260-

11 allocation shall specify the total number of acre-inches that are
12 allocated per irrigated acre per year, except that the district may allow
13 a ground water user to average his or her allocation over any reasonable
14 period of time. A ground water user may use his or her allocation on all
15 or any part of the irrigated acres to which the allocation applies or in
16 any other manner approved by the district.
17 (2) Except as permitted pursuant to subsections (4) through (6) of
18 section 46-739, if annual rotation or reduction of irrigated acres is
19 adopted for use of ground water for irrigation purposes in a management
20 area, the nonuse of irrigated acres shall be a uniform percentage
21 reduction of each landowner's irrigated acres within the management area
22 or a subarea of the management area. Such uniform reduction may be
23 adjusted for each landowner based upon crops grown on his or her land to
24 reflect the varying consumptive requirements between crops.
25 (3) Unless an integrated management plan, a rule, or an order is
26 established, adopted, or issued prior to November 1, 2005, no integrated
27 management plan, rule, or order shall limit the use of ground water by a
28 municipality, within an area determined by the Chief Water Officer

8 amended to read:
9 57-1614 (1) The commission shall take action to ensure that a
10 storage facility does not cause pollution or create a nuisance. For the
11 purposes of this provision and in applying other laws, carbon dioxide
12 streams stored, and which remain in storage under a commission permit,
13 are not a pollutant and do not constitute a nuisance.
14 (2) The commission's authority in subsection (1) of this section
15 does not limit the jurisdiction held by the Department of Water, Energy,
16 and Environment Environment and Energy. Nothing else in the Nebraska
17 Geologic Storage of Carbon Dioxide Act limits the jurisdiction held by
18 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy.

31 hearing.
-329-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (3) The certificate may only be issued after the commission has
2 consulted with the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
3 Environment and Energy and the Underground Injection Control program
4 permitting authority.
5 (4) The certificate may only be issued if the storage operator:

7 facility;
8 (b) Shows that it has addressed all pending claims regarding the
9 storage facility's operation;
10 (c) Shows that it has received an authorization of site closure from
11 the applicable underground injection control program permitting authority
12 for each storage facility injection well; and
13 (d) Shows that any wells, equipment, and facilities to be used in
14 the post-closure period are in good condition and retain mechanical
15 integrity.
16 (5) Once a certificate is issued:
17 (a) Title to the storage facility and to the stored carbon dioxide
18 transfers, without payment of any compensation, to the State of Nebraska;
19 (b) Title acquired by the state includes all rights and interests
20 in, and all responsibilities associated with, the stored carbon dioxide;
21 (c) The storage operator and all persons who generated any injected
22 carbon dioxide streams are released from all regulatory requirements
23 associated with the storage facility;
24 (d) Any financial assurance provided by the storage operator shall
25 be released; and
26 (e) Monitoring and managing the storage facility is the state's
27 responsibility to be overseen by the commission.
28 Sec. 321. Section 58-202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 58-202 (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
31 (a) The high cost of agricultural loans and the general
-330-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 unavailability of such loans at favorable rates and terms for farmers,
2 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises have
3 resulted in decreased crop, livestock, and business productivity and
4 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
5 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
6 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
7 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
8 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
9 citizens of this state; and
10 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
11 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
12 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
13 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
14 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
15 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
16 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
17 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
18 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
19 construction industry;
20 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
21 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
22 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
23 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
24 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
25 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
26 facilities; and
27 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
28 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
29 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
30 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
31 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
-331-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
2 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
3 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
4 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
5 food and shelter;
6 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
7 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
8 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
9 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
10 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
11 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
12 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
13 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
14 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
15 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
16 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
17 facilities to produce and supply energy;
18 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
19 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
20 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
21 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
22 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
23 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
24 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
25 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
26 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
27 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
28 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
29 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
30 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
31 suppliers.

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
2 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
3 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
4 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
5 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
6 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
7 and social liabilities to the entire state;
8 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
9 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
10 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
11 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
12 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
13 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
14 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
15 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
16 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
17 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
18 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
19 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
20 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
21 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
22 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
23 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
24 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
25 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
26 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
27 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
28 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
29 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
30 and protect the public health and welfare;
31 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
-333-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
2 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
3 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
4 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
5 needed within this state; and
6 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
7 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
8 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
9 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
10 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
11 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
12 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
13 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
14 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
15 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
16 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
17 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
18 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
19 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
20 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
21 safe drinking water facilities is great;
22 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
23 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
24 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
25 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
26 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
27 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
28 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
29 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
30 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
31 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
-334-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
2 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
3 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
4 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
5 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
6 and
7 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
8 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
9 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
10 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
11 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
12 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
13 section shall prohibit the provision of loans , including loans made
14 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act, to a municipality as
15 defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction, development,
16 rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of wastewater
17 treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.
18 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
19 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
20 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
21 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
22 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
23 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
24 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
25 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
26 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
27 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
28 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
29 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
30 educational benefits and services;
31 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
-335-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
2 and
3 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
4 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
5 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
6 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
7 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
8 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
9 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
10 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
11 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
12 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
13 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
14 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
15 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
16 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
17 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
18 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
19 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
20 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
21 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
22 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
23 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
24 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
25 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
26 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
27 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
28 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
29 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
30 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
31 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
-336-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
2 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
3 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
4 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
5 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
6 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
7 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
8 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
9 public health and welfare;
10 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
11 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
12 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
13 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
14 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
15 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
16 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
17 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the
18 financing of solid waste disposal areas and facilities and in the removal
19 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
20 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
21 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
22 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
23 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
24 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save
25 lives, to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
26 (b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for
27 use by Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska
28 Public Safety Communication System Act;
29 (c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
30 required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies.
31 Since the maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the
-337-
ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 cost of purchasing and operating multiple communication infrastructures
2 is prohibitive, it is imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in
3 their efforts to obtain real and personal property to establish, operate,
4 maintain, and manage public safety communication systems; and
5 (d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
6 political subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal
7 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition,
8 construction, and operation of real and personal property of public
9 safety communication systems.
10 (9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27,
11 2005, and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects,
12 there is a need to increase both the limit on individual net worth and
13 the limit on the aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the
14 authority. Such adjustments are necessary to address the inadequate
15 supply of and pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan
16 financing at interest rates and terms that are consistent with the needs
17 of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural
18 enterprises.
19 (10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
20 (a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy
21 the problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
22 insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
23 powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
24 funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal
25 sources;
26 (b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance
27 Authority Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies
28 and private entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such
29 public-private and intergovernmental cooperation; and
30 (c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made
31 available to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of
-338-

23 and other byproducts of ethanol production which (i) is not in production
24 on or before September 1, 2001, or (ii) has not received credits prior to
25 June 1, 1999. A new ethanol facility does not mean an expansion of an
26 existing ethanol plant that does not result in the physical construction
27 of an entire ethanol processing facility or which shares or uses in a
28 significant manner any existing plant's systems or processes and does not
29 include the expansion of production capacity constructed after June 30,
30 2004, of a plant qualifying for credits under this subsection. This

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 there exists a serious threat to the health and safety of citizens
2 because substances contained in leaking storage tanks are often potential
3 ground water contaminants and major fire and explosive hazards.
4 For the reasons stated in this section, the Legislature deems it
5 necessary to provide a program of storage tank registration and
6 inspection as a preventative measure and a comprehensive leak cleanup
7 program as a responsive measure. Primary responsibility for the Petroleum
8 Products and Hazardous Substances Storage and Handling Act shall be with
9 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment Environment and Energy.
10 However, preventative measures described in such act shall also be
11 carried out by the State Fire Marshal. The State Fire Marshal's actions
12 shall be pursuant to an interagency agreement with the department.

18 develop a plan for remedial action to be approved by the department. The
19 department shall inform the owner or operator of its approval or
20 disapproval of a plan for remedial action within one hundred twenty days
21 after receipt of a remedial action plan which contains all required
22 information. If after one hundred twenty days the department fails to
23 either deny, approve, or amend the remedial action plan submitted, the
24 proposed plan shall be deemed approved; and
25 (3) The approved remedial action plan shall then be carried out by
26 the owner or operator of the tank causing the release. All expenses
27 incurred during the remedial action shall be paid by the owner or
28 operator subject to reimbursement pursuant to the Petroleum Release

2 (3) A certificate of completion shall be revoked if the department
3 demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that any approval
4 provided under this section was obtained by fraud or material
5 misrepresentation, knowing failure to disclose material information, or
6 false certification to the department. The department shall file a copy
7 of the notice of revocation of any certificate of completion in the real
8 estate records of the county in which the remedial action took place
9 within ten days after such revocation.
10 (4) If a responsible person transfers property to an affiliate in
11 order for that affiliate to obtain a benefit to which the transferor
12 would not otherwise be eligible under this section or to avoid an
13 obligation under this section, the affiliate shall be subject to the same
14 obligations and obtain the same level of benefits as those available to
15 the transferor under this section.
16 (5)(a) A covenant not to sue arising under subsection (1) of this
17 section, unless voided pursuant to such subsection, shall bar suit
18 against any person who acquires title to property to which a certificate
19 of completion applies for all claims of the state or any other person in
20 connection with petroleum products which were the subject of an approved
21 remedial action plan and (b) a person who purchased a site before May 31,
22 2001, is released, upon the issuance of a certificate of completion under
23 this section or upon the issuance of a no further action letter on or
24 after May 31, 2001, pursuant to section 81-15,186, from all liability to
25 the state for cleanup of contamination that was released at the site
26 covered by the certificate of completion or the no further action letter
27 before the purchase date, except as provided in subsection (4) of this
28 section, for releases or consequences that the person contributed to or
29 caused, for failure by such person to comply with the monitoring,
30 institutional, or technological controls, if any, upon which the
31 certificate of completion is conditioned, or in the event the certificate

4 sue or eligible to be released from liability pursuant to the issuance of
5 a certificate of completion or a no further action letter under
6 subsection (5) of this section who is ordered by the department to take
7 remedial action shall be eligible for reimbursement as a responsible
8 person pursuant to section 66-1525 and shall not be required to pay the
9 first cost or percent of the remaining cost as provided in subsection (1)
10 of section 66-1523 unless such person contributed to or caused the
11 release or failed to comply with the monitoring, institutional, or

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 specifications for such improvement have been approved by the Chief Water
2 Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment. When such a
3 special project involves a public water system as defined in section
4 71-5301, the Director of Water, Energy, and Environment shall Director of
5 Natural Resources and the Department of Environment and Energy, if
6 applicable, except that if such special project involves a public water
7 system as defined in section 71-5301, only the Department of Environment
8 and Energy shall be required to review such plans and specifications and
9 approve the same if in compliance with the Nebraska Safe Drinking Water
10 Act and departmental rules and regulations adopted and promulgated under
11 the act. All prescribed conditions having been complied with, each
12 landowner within the improvement project area shall, within any limits
13 otherwise prescribed by law, subscribe to a number of benefit units in
14 proportion to the extent he or she desires to participate in the benefits
15 of the special project. As long as the capacity of the district's
16 facilities permit, participating landowners may subscribe to additional
17 units, within any limits otherwise prescribed by law, upon payment of a
18 unit fee for each such unit. The unit fees made and charged pursuant to
19 this section shall be levied and fixed by rules and regulations of the
20 district. The service provided may be withheld during the time such
21 charges levied upon such parcel of land are delinquent and unpaid. Such
22 charges shall be cumulative, and the service provided by the project may
23 be withheld until all delinquent charges for the operation and
24 maintenance of such works of improvement are paid for past years as well
25 as for the current year. All such charges, due and delinquent according
26 to the rules and regulations of such district and unpaid on June 1 after
27 becoming due and delinquent, may be certified by the governing authority
28 of such district to the county clerk of such county in which are situated
29 the lands against which such charges have been levied, and when so
30 certified such charges shall be entered upon the tax list and spread upon
31 the tax roll the same as other special assessment taxes are levied and

2 along with other real estate taxes, and shall be collectible at the same
3 time, in the same manner, and in the same proceeding as other real estate
4 taxes are levied.
5 (3) When the special project would not result in the provision of
6 revenue-producing continuing services, the board shall apportion the
7 benefits thereof accruing to the several tracts of land within the
8 district which will be benefited thereby, on a system of units. The land
9 least benefited shall be apportioned one unit of assessment, and each
10 tract receiving a greater benefit shall be apportioned a greater number
11 of units or fraction thereof, according to the benefits received. Nothing
12 contained in this section shall prevent the district from establishing
13 separate areas within the improvement project area so as to permit future
14 allocation of costs for particular portions of the work to specific
15 subareas. This subarea method of allocation shall not be used in any
16 improvement project area which has heretofore made a final apportionment
17 of units of benefits and shall not thereafter be changed except by
18 compliance with the procedure prescribed in this section.
19 (4) A notice shall be inserted for at least one week in a newspaper
20 published or of general circulation in the improvement project area
21 stating the time when and the place where the directors shall meet for
22 the purpose of hearing all parties interested in the apportionment of
23 benefits by reason of the improvement, at which time and place such
24 parties may appear in person or by counsel or may file written objections
25 thereto. The directors shall then proceed to hear and consider the same
26 and shall make the apportionments fair and just according to benefits
27 received from the improvement. The directors, having completed the
28 apportionment of benefits, shall make a detailed report of the same and
29 file such report with the county clerk. The board of directors shall
30 include in such report a statement of the actual expenses incurred by the
31 district to that time which relate to the proposed project and the actual

2 cause to be published, once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
3 newspaper published or of general circulation in the improvement project
4 area, a notice that the report required in this subsection has been filed
5 and notice shall also be sent to each party appearing to have a direct
6 legal interest in such apportionment, which notice shall include the
7 description of the lands in which each party notified appears to have
8 such interest, the units of benefit assigned to such lands, the amount of
9 actual costs assessable to date to such lands, and the estimated total
10 costs of the project assessable to such lands upon completion thereof, as
11 provided by sections 25-520.01 to 25-520.03. If the owners of record
12 title representing more than fifty percent of the estimated total
13 assessments file with the board within thirty days of the final
14 publication of such notice written objections to the project proposed,
15 such project and work in connection therewith shall be suspended, such
16 project shall not be done in such project area, and all expenses relating
17 to such project incurred by and accrued to the district may, at the
18 direction of the board of directors, be assessed upon the lands which
19 were to have been benefited by the completion of such improvement project
20 in accordance with the apportionment of benefits determined and
21 procedures established in this section. Upon completing the establishment
22 of an improvement project area or altering the boundaries of an existing

1 the original apportionment of benefits as a basis to ascertain the
2 assessment to each tract of land benefited, to carry out a reasonable
3 program of operation and maintenance upon the construction or capital
4 improvements involved in such project. The chairperson and secretary
5 shall thereupon return lists of such tracts with the amounts chargeable
6 to each of the county clerks of each county in which assessed lands are
7 located, who shall place the same on duplicate tax lists against the
8 lands and lots so assessed. Such assessments shall be collected and
9 accounted for by the county treasurer at the same time as general real
10 estate taxes, and such assessments shall be and remain a perpetual lien
11 against such real estate until paid. All provisions of law for the sale,
12 redemption, and foreclosure in ordinary tax matters shall apply to such
13 special assessments.

4 Sec. 31. Section 2-4602, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
5 amended to read:
6 2-4602 The Legislature recognizes that erosion and sedimentation are
7 serious problems throughout the state. Changes in farm and ranch
8 enterprises, operations, and ownership, demands made upon farm and ranch
9 enterprises which do not encourage sound resource utilization, rapid
10 shifts in land use from agricultural and rural to nonagricultural and
11 urban uses, construction of streets, highways, pipelines, recreation
12 areas, schools and universities, public utilities and facilities,
13 conversion of grasslands to croplands, and other land-disturbing
14 activities have caused excessive wind erosion and water runoff and
15 accelerated the process of soil erosion and sediment deposition. This has
16 resulted in the pollution of the waters of the state and damage to
17 domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, fish and wildlife, and
18 other resources. It is declared to be the policy of the state to
19 strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities
20 and programs of the state for both rural and urban lands, to improve
21 water quality, and to establish and implement, through the Director of
22 Water, Energy, and Environment Natural Resources and the Nebraska Natural
23 Resources Commission, a statewide, comprehensive, and coordinated erosion
24 and sediment control program to reduce damage from wind erosion and storm
25 water runoff, to retard nonpoint pollution from sediment and related
26 pollutants, and to conserve and protect land, air, and other resources of
27 the state. This program shall be carried out by the natural resources
28 districts in cooperation with the counties, municipalities, and other
29 local governments and political subdivisions of the state and other
30 public and private entities.

3 of land to which it is applied unless a change of location has been
4 approved by the board of directors pursuant to sections 46-2,127 to
5 46-2,129 or by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources

5 Officer director may issue an order canceling the appropriation to the
6 extent agreed to by the owner or owners and shall provide a copy of such

9 (3) For any owner whose name and address are not known to the Chief
10 Water Officer department and cannot reasonably be obtained by the Chief

26 verified field investigation report of an employee of the department, or
27 such other report or information that is relied upon by the Chief Water

31 appropriation or unused part thereof shall be declared forfeited and
-87-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 annulled. If an interested person appears and contests the same, the
2 Chief Water Officer department shall hear evidence, and if it appears
3 that such water has not been put to a beneficial use or has ceased to be
4 used for such purpose for more than five consecutive years, the same
5 shall be declared canceled and annulled unless the Chief Water Officer
6 department finds that (a) there has been sufficient cause for such nonuse
7 as provided for in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of this section or (b)
8 subsection (5) or (6) of this section applies.
9 (2) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
10 thirty consecutive years if:
11 (a) Such nonuse was caused by the unavailability of water for that
12 use. For a river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been designated as
13 overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined by the Chief
14 Water Officer department to be fully appropriated pursuant to section
15 46-714, the period of time within which sufficient cause for nonuse
16 because of the unavailability of water may be deemed to exist may be
17 extended beyond thirty years by the Chief Water Officer department upon
18 petition therefor by the owner of the appropriation if the Chief Water
19 Officer department determines that an integrated management plan being
20 implemented in the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved is likely to
21 result in restoration of a usable water supply for the appropriation; or
22 (b) The land subject to the appropriation is under an acreage
23 reserve program or production quota or is otherwise withdrawn from use as
24 required for participation in any federal, state, or natural resources
25 district program, or such land was previously under such a program but
26 currently is not under such a program and there have been not more than
27 five consecutive years of nonuse on such land subsequent to when that
28 land was last under such program.
29 (3) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist
30 indefinitely if such nonuse was the result of one or more of the
31 following:
-88-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (a) For any tract of land under separate ownership, the available
2 supply was used but on only part of the land under the appropriation
3 because of an inadequate water supply;
4 (b) The appropriation is a storage appropriation and there was an
5 inadequate water supply to provide the water for the storage
6 appropriation or less than the full amount of the storage appropriation
7 was needed to keep the reservoir full; or
8 (c) The appropriation is a storage-use appropriation and there was
9 an inadequate water supply to provide the water for the appropriation or
10 use of the storage water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions.
11 (4) Sufficient cause for nonuse shall be deemed to exist for up to
12 fifteen consecutive years if such nonuse was a result of one or more of
13 the following:
14 (a) Federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations temporarily
15 prevented or restricted such use;
16 (b) Use of the water was unnecessary because of climatic conditions;
17 (c) Circumstances were such that a prudent person, following the
18 principles of good husbandry, would not have been expected to use the
19 water;
20 (d) The works, diversions, or other facilities essential to use the
21 water were destroyed by a cause not within the control of the owner of
22 the appropriation and good faith efforts to repair or replace the works,
23 diversions, or facilities have been and are being made;
24 (e) The owner of the appropriation was in active involuntary service
25 in the armed forces of the United States or was in active voluntary
26 service during a time of crisis; or
27 (f) Legal proceedings prevented or restricted use of the water.
28 The Chief Water Officer department may specify by rule and
29 regulation other circumstances that shall be deemed to constitute
30 sufficient cause for nonuse for up to fifteen years.

1 district, a reclamation district, a public power and irrigation district,
2 a mutual irrigation company or canal company, or the United States Bureau
3 of Reclamation and the Chief Water Officer director determines that water
4 under that appropriation has not been used on a specific parcel of land
5 for more than five years and that no sufficient cause for such nonuse
6 exists, the right to use water under that appropriation on that parcel
7 shall be terminated and notice of the termination shall be posted on the
8 department's website and shall be given in the manner provided in
9 subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The district or company
10 holding such right shall have five years after the determination, or five
11 years after an order of cancellation issued by the Chief Water Officer
12 department following the filing of a voluntary relinquishment of the
13 water appropriation that has been signed by the landowner and the
14 appropriator of record, to assign the right to use that portion of the
15 appropriation to other land within the district or the area served by the
16 company, to file an application for a transfer in accordance with section
17 46-290, or to transfer the right in accordance with sections 46-2,127 to
18 46-2,129. The Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its order of
19 cancellation within sixty days after receipt of the voluntary
20 relinquishment unless the relinquishment is conditioned by the landowner
21 upon an action of a governmental agency. If the relinquishment contains
22 such a provision, the Chief Water Officer department shall issue the its
23 order of cancellation within sixty days after receipt of notification
24 that such action has been completed. The Chief Water Officer department
25 shall be notified of any such assignment within thirty days after such
26 assignment. If the district or company does not assign the right to use
27 that portion of the appropriation to other land, does not file an
28 application for a transfer within the five-year period, or does not
29 notify the Chief Water Officer department within thirty days after any
30 such assignment, that portion of the appropriation shall be canceled
31 without further proceedings by the Chief Water Officer department and the
-90-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 district or company involved shall be so notified by the Chief Water
2 Officer department. During the time within which assignment of a portion
3 of an appropriation is pending, the allowable diversion rate for the
4 appropriation involved shall be reduced, as necessary, to avoid
5 inconsistency with the rate allowed by section 46-231 or with any greater
6 rate previously approved for such appropriation by the Chief Water
7 Officer director in accordance with section 46-229.06.
8 (6) When it is determined by the Chief Water Officer director that
9 an appropriation, for which the location of use has been temporarily
10 transferred in accordance with sections 46-290 to 46-294, has not been
11 used at the new location for more than five years and that no sufficient
12 cause for such nonuse exists, the right to use that appropriation at the
13 temporary location of use shall be terminated. Notice of that termination
14 shall be posted on the department's website and shall be given in the
15 manner provided in subsection (2), (3), or (4) of section 46-229.03. The
16 right to reinitiate use of that appropriation at the location of use
17 prior to the temporary transfer shall continue to exist for five years
18 after the Chief Water Officer's director's determination, but if such use
19 is not reinitiated at that location within such five-year period, the
20 appropriation shall be subject to cancellation in accordance with
21 sections 46-229 to 46-229.04.
22 (7) If at the time of a hearing conducted in accordance with
23 subsection (1) of this section there is an application for incidental or
24 intentional underground water storage pending before the Chief Water
25 Officer department and filed by the owner of the appropriation, the
26 proceedings shall be consolidated.
27 Sec. 81. Section 46-229.05, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

1 amended to read:
2 46-229.06 When a departmental proceeding that is conducted pursuant
3 to sections 46-229 to 46-229.04 concerns the partial cancellation of an
4 appropriation, the Chief Water Officer department may receive evidence on
5 the question of whether, following such partial cancellation, a reduction
6 in the rate of diversion to the maximum rate prescribed in section 46-231
7 would result in an authorized diversion rate less than the rate
8 necessary, in the interests of good husbandry, for the production of
9 crops on the lands that remain subject to the appropriation. If the Chief
10 Water Officer director determines, based on a preponderance of the
11 evidence, that such rate would be less than the rate necessary, in the
12 interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops, he or she may
13 approve a diversion rate for the remaining portion of the appropriation
14 greater than the maximum rate authorized by section 46-231. Such
15 increased rate can be no greater than the rate authorized for the
16 appropriation prior to the partial cancellation and no greater than the
17 rate determined by the Chief Water Officer director to be necessary, in
18 the interests of good husbandry, for the production of crops on the lands
19 that remain subject to the appropriation.
20 Sec. 83. Section 46-230, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-230 (1) As the adjudication of a stream progresses and as each
23 claim is finally adjudicated, the Chief Water Officer director shall make
24 and cause to be entered of record in his or her office an order
25 determining and establishing the priorities of right to use the water of
26 such stream, the amount of the appropriation of the persons claiming
27 water from such stream and the character of use for which each
28 appropriation is found to have been made, and the address of the owner of
29 each water appropriation.
30 (2) Whenever requested by the Chief Water Officer department, the
31 owner of any appropriation not held by an irrigation district,

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
2 irrigation or canal company shall provide the Chief Water Officer
3 department with the name, address, and telephone number of each then-
4 current owner of the appropriation and with the name, address, and
5 telephone number of any tenant or other person who is authorized by the
6 owner to receive opening and closing notices and other departmental
7 communications relating to the appropriation. Each appropriation owner
8 shall also notify the Chief Water Officer department any time there is a
9 change in any of such names, addresses, or telephone numbers. Notice of
10 ownership changes may be provided to the Chief Water Officer department
11 in the manner provided in section 76-2,124 or in any other manner
12 authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. If notice of an
13 ownership change is provided other than in accordance with such section,
14 the notice shall include such evidence of ownership as the Chief Water
15 Officer director may require. Notice of all other changes may be provided
16 in any manner authorized by the Chief Water Officer department. Upon
17 receipt of any new information, the Chief Water Officer department shall
18 update the Chief Water Officer's its records. The Chief Water Officer
19 department shall not collect a fee for the filing of any such information
20 or for updating the Chief Water Officer's its records.
21 Sec. 84. Section 46-231, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-231 Each appropriation shall be determined in its priority and
24 amount by the time at which it is made and the amount of water which the
25 works are constructed to carry. An appropriator shall at no time be
26 entitled to the use of more than he or she can beneficially use for the
27 purposes for which the appropriation has been made, and the amount of any
28 appropriation made by means of enlargement of the distributing works
29 shall be determined in like manner.
30 An allotment from the natural flow of streams for irrigation shall
31 not exceed one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of
-93-

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 land and shall not exceed three acre-feet in the aggregate during one
2 calendar year for each acre of land for which such appropriation has been
3 made, and an allotment shall not exceed the least amount of water that
4 experience may indicate is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry,
5 for the production of crops. Such limitations do not apply to storage
6 waters or to water appropriations transferred pursuant to sections
7 46-2,122 to 46-2,125 and 46-2,127 to 46-2,129.
8 When storage water is being used in addition to the natural flow,
9 the person in charge of the ditch or canal shall, upon his or her request
10 and within twenty-four hours thereof, be notified in writing by the user
11 of such storage waters of the time of withdrawal from natural streams to
12 be distributed according to law.
13 When an appropriation is for irrigation purposes and the amount is
14 so small that a proper distribution and application is impractical, as
15 much water as the applicant can use without waste may be allotted for a
16 limited time so fixed by the Chief Water Officer department as to give
17 each appropriator his or her just share without violating other rights,
18 so long as (1) the volume of water used in a twenty-four-hour period does
19 not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been allowed at
20 the approved fixed continuous rate for a twenty-four-hour period or (2)
21 the volume of water used in a seven-day, Monday-through-Sunday period
22 does not exceed the amount of water that would otherwise have been
23 allowed at the approved fixed continuous rate for a seven-day period. The
24 Chief Water Officer department shall determine schedules among
25 appropriators to assure that other rights are not violated.
26 Sec. 85. Section 46-233, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
27 amended to read:
28 46-233 (1) The United States and every person intending to
29 appropriate any of the public waters of the State of Nebraska shall,
30 before (a) commencing the construction, enlargement, or extension of any
31 works for such purpose, (b) performing any work in connection with such

1 construction, enlargement, or extension, or (c) taking any water from any
2 constructed works, make an application to the Chief Water Officer
3 department for a permit to make such appropriation. A permit may be
4 obtained to appropriate public waters for intentional underground water
5 storage and recovery of such water. A public water supplier may make
6 application to appropriate public waters for induced ground water
7 recharge.
8 (2) The application shall be upon a form prescribed and furnished by
9 the Chief Water Officer department without cost to an applicant. Such
10 application shall set forth (a) the name and post office address of the
11 applicant, (b) the source from which such appropriation shall be made,
12 (c) the amount of the appropriation desired, as nearly as it may be
13 estimated, (d) the location of any proposed work in connection with the
14 appropriation, (e) the estimated time required for its completion, which
15 estimated time shall include the period required for the construction of
16 ditches, pumps, and other features or devices, (f) the time estimated at
17 which the application of the water for the beneficial purposes shall be
18 made, which time shall be limited to a reasonable time following the
19 estimated time of completion of the work when prosecuted with diligence,
20 (g) the purpose for which water is to be applied and (i) if for induced
21 ground water recharge by a public water supplier, a statement of the

2 A public water supplier making application for induced ground water
3 recharge may submit with its application a statement of the amount of
4 induced ground water recharge water which the public water supplier
5 presently uses as well as the amount of induced ground water recharge
6 water it anticipates using in the next twenty-five-year period. Such
7 statement shall also quantify the total amount of water the public water
8 supplier presently uses from the well field as well as the total amount
9 of water it anticipates using from the well field in the next twenty-
10 five-year period.
11 (3) Upon receipt of an application containing the information set
12 forth in this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall (a) make
13 a record of the receipt of the application, (b) cause the application to
14 be recorded in its office, and (c) make a careful examination of the
15 application to ascertain whether it sets forth all the facts necessary to
16 enable the Chief Water Officer department to determine the nature and
17 amount of the proposed appropriation. If such an examination shows the
18 application in any way defective, it shall be returned to the applicant
19 for correction, with a statement of the correction required, within
20 ninety days after its receipt. Ninety days shall be allowed for the
21 refiling of the application, and in default of such refiling, the
22 application shall stand dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (4)
23 of this section, if so filed and corrected as required within such time,
24 the application shall, upon being accepted and allowed, take priority as
25 of the date of the original filing, subject to compliance with the future
26 provisions of the law and the rules and regulations thereunder. During
27 the pendency of any application or upon its approval, the Chief Water
28 Officer department, upon proper authorization and request of the
29 applicant, may assign the application a later priority date.

13 (e) January 1, 1993, for water supply wells and facilities
14 constructed and placed in service on or after January 1, 1990, and on or
15 before September 9, 1993.
16 (5) Prior to taking action on an application for induced ground
17 water recharge, the Chief Water Officer director shall publish notice of
18 such application at the applicant's expense at least once each week for
19 three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
20 of the stream segment and also in a newspaper of statewide circulation.
21 The notice shall state that any person having an interest may, in
22 writing, object to the application. Any such objection shall be filed
23 with the Chief Water Officer department within two weeks after the final
24 publication of the notice.
25 (6) After the Chief Water Officer director has accepted the
26 application made under subsection (2) of this section as a completed
27 application and published notice as required under subsection (5) of this
28 section, the Chief Water Officer director shall, if he or she determines
29 that a hearing is necessary, set a time and place for a public hearing on
30 the application. The hearing shall be held within reasonable proximity to
31 the area in which the wells are or would be located. At the hearing the
-97-

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 applicant shall present all hydrological data and other evidence
2 supporting its application. All interested parties shall be allowed to
3 testify and present evidence relative to the application.
4 (7) An unapproved application pending on August 26, 1983, may be
5 amended to include appropriation for intentional underground water
6 storage and recovery of such water.
7 (8) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer department
8 for a temporary permit to appropriate water. The same standards for
9 granting a permanent appropriation shall apply for granting such
10 temporary permit except when the temporary permit is for road
11 construction or other public use construction and the amount of water
12 requested is less than ten acre-feet in total volume. For temporary
13 permits for public-use construction, the applicant shall include on the
14 application the location of the diversion, the location of use, a
15 description of the project, the amount of water requested, and the person
16 to contact. Temporary permits for public-use construction and for less
17 than ten acre-feet in total volume may be granted without any
18 determination of unappropriated water and shall be considered to be in
19 the public interest. The requirement of filing a map or plans with the
20 application for a temporary permit may be waived at the discretion of the
21 Chief Water Officer director. In granting a temporary permit, the Chief
22 Water Officer director shall specify a date on which the right to
23 appropriate water under the permit shall expire. Under no circumstances
24 shall such date be longer than one calendar year after the date the
25 temporary permit was granted. Temporary permits shall be administered
26 during times of shortage based on priority. The right to appropriate
27 water shall automatically terminate on the date specified by the Chief
28 Water Officer director on the temporary permit without further action by
29 the Chief Water Officer department.
30 (9) Water may be diverted from any stream, reservoir, or canal by
31 any fire department or emergency response services for the purpose of

3 well for this purpose is allowed without the prior permission of the
4 Chief Water Officer department, but the Chief Water Officer department
5 shall be informed of any such installation, its location, and the party
6 responsible for its installation and maintenance within thirty days after
7 the installation.
8 Sec. 86. Section 46-233.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
9 amended to read:
10 46-233.01 (1) Application may be made to the Chief Water Officer
11 department for a permit to appropriate any of the public surface waters
12 of the State of Nebraska to be diverted or stored in Nebraska for use in
13 any other state.
14 (2) In determining whether to grant such application, the Chief
15 Water Officer director shall consider the following factors:
16 (a) Whether unappropriated water exists in the source of supply
17 named in the application;
18 (b) Whether such application and appropriation when perfected are
19 not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
20 (c) Whether denial of the application is demanded by the public
21 interest; and
22 (d) Whether the proposed use is a beneficial use of water.
23 (3) When determining whether denial of such application is demanded
24 by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer director shall consider
25 the following factors:
26 (a) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
27 use;
28 (b) Any adverse economic, environmental, and other impacts of the
29 proposed use;
30 (c) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
31 water;
-99-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317

1 (d) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of not allowing
2 the appropriation and preserving the water supply for beneficial uses
3 within the state;
4 (e) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
5 and
6 (f) Any other factors consistent with the purposes of this section
7 that the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant to protecting the
8 interests of the state and its citizens.
9 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
10 overall benefits to Nebraska are greater than the adverse impacts to
11 Nebraska. The Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying
12 an application shall specify the reasons for such action, including a
13 discussion of the required factors for consideration, and shall document
14 such decision by reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any
15 other sources used by the Chief Water Officer director in making the
16 decision.
17 Sec. 87. Section 46-234, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
18 amended to read:
19 46-234 If there is no unappropriated water in the source of supply
20 or if a prior appropriation has been perfected to water the same land to
21 be watered by the applicant, the Chief Water Officer department may
22 refuse such application. An application may also be refused (1) if
23 existing facilities other than those owned or operated by the applicant
24 are to be utilized and the applicant fails to show, by documentary
25 evidence, agreements with the owner and operator of the facilities to
26 allow the applicant to use such facilities or (2) when denial is demanded
27 by the public interest. The party making such application shall not
28 prosecute such work so long as such refusal continues in force. An
29 application for appropriation shall not be exclusive of any of the lands
30 included therein until the owner or owners of such land give consent to
31 the same in proper form duly acknowledged. No application made or canal

1 constructed, prior to the application of the water and the perfection of
2 an appropriation therefor or the filing of the consent, shall prevent
3 other applications from being allowed and other canals from being
4 constructed to irrigate the same lands or any of them. In case of an
5 application for an appropriation of water for the development of water
6 power, the Chief Water Officer department shall promptly act upon such
7 application and limit the time within which such appropriation shall be
8 perfected to the period within which the proposed power project can be
9 completed by uninterrupted and expeditious construction.
10 Sec. 88. Section 46-235, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
11 amended to read:
12 46-235 (1) For applications other than those to appropriate public
13 waters for induced ground water recharge, if there is unappropriated
14 water in the source of supply named in the application, if such
15 application and appropriation when perfected are not otherwise
16 detrimental to the public welfare, and if denial of the application is
17 not demanded by the public interest, the Chief Water Officer department
18 shall approve the application and shall make a record in its office and
19 return the application to the applicant, who shall on receipt thereof be
20 authorized to proceed with the work and to take such measures as may be
21 necessary to perfect such application into an appropriation. The priority
22 of such application and appropriation when perfected shall date from the
23 filing of the application with in the Chief Water Officer office of the
24 department, and the date of filing shall be regarded as the priority
25 number thereof. The Chief Water Officer department may, upon examination
26 of such application, approve it for a shorter period of time for
27 perfecting the proposed appropriation or for a smaller amount of water or
28 of land than applied for. The Chief Water Officer department may also
29 impose such other reasonable conditions as the Chief Water Officer it
30 deems appropriate to protect the public interest. An applicant aggrieved
31 by the action of the Chief Water Officer department shall, upon proper

1 showing, be granted a hearing before the Chief Water Officer department,
2 which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
3 procedure adopted by the Chief Water Officer department, and a full and
4 complete record shall be kept of all such proceedings. When a complete
5 record of the case has been made up, the Chief Water Officer department
6 shall render an opinion of facts and of law based upon the evidence
7 before the Chief Water Officer it.
8 (2)(a) An application for an induced ground water recharge
9 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
10 service before September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief Water
11 Officer director if he or she finds that:
12 (i) The appropriation is necessary to maintain the well or wells for
13 the use or uses for which the appropriation has been requested;
14 (ii) The rate and timing of the flow is the amount reasonably
15 necessary to maintain the well or wells for the uses for which the
16 appropriation has been requested; and
17 (iii) The application is in the public interest and is not
18 detrimental to the public welfare. There shall be a rebuttable
19 presumption that wells which are the subject of an application pursuant
20 to subdivision (2)(a) of this section are in the public interest and are
21 not detrimental to the public welfare.
22 (b) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application for
23 a well or wells constructed before September 9, 1993, but may
24 specifically deny the applicant the right to request regulation of junior
25 appropriators if the Chief Water Officer director, at the time of
26 approval, finds that the well or wells, at the time of their
27 construction, were not located, designed, or constructed so as to take
28 reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the area to minimize the
29 frequency and amount of the demand for flows for induced ground water
30 recharge. Thereafter a public water supplier holding an approved
31 application which has been denied the right to request regulation of
-102-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 junior appropriators may petition the Chief Water Officer director for a
2 hearing to present evidence showing the Chief Water Officer director that
3 the well or wells have been modified, relocated, or reconstructed to take
4 reasonable advantage of the aquifer conditions in the area. If the Chief
5 Water Officer director determines that the well or wells have been so
6 modified, relocated, or reconstructed, the Chief Water Officer director
7 shall cause to be modified the approval of the application to allow for
8 the regulation of junior appropriators, subject to the restrictions or
9 conditions applicable to public water suppliers.
10 (c) An application for an induced ground water recharge
11 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed and placed in
12 service before September 9, 1993, shall not be subject to the
13 requirements of sections 46-288 and 46-289.
14 (3) An application for an induced ground water recharge
15 appropriation for public water supplier wells constructed or to be
16 constructed on or after September 9, 1993, shall be approved by the Chief
17 Water Officer director if he or she makes the findings required by
18 subdivision (2)(a) of this section and further finds that:
19 (a) There is unappropriated water available for the appropriation;
20 and
21 (b) The well or wells involved have been or will be located and
22 constructed to take reasonable advantage of aquifer conditions in the
23 area to minimize the frequency and amount of the demand for flows for
24 induced ground water recharge.
25 (4)(a) The Chief Water Officer director may approve the application
26 filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section for a smaller amount of
27 water than requested by the applicant. The Chief Water Officer director
28 may also impose reasonable conditions on the manner and timing of the
29 appropriation which the Chief Water Officer director deems necessary to
30 protect the public interest. The Chief Water Officer director may grant
31 an appropriation for specific months of the year if so demanded by the

2 application, he or she shall issue a written order, which written order
3 shall include the findings required by this section, the amount of the
4 appropriation, and any conditions or limitations imposed under this
5 section.
6 (b) In determining whether an application for an appropriation for
7 induced ground water recharge is in the public interest, the Chief Water
8 Officer's director's considerations shall include, but not be limited to,
9 the possible adverse effects on existing surface water or ground water
10 users and the economic, social, and environmental value of such uses,
11 including, but not limited to, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife,
12 public water supply, induced ground water recharge for public water
13 supply systems, and water quality maintenance.
14 (c) The stream segment and the determination of a reasonable and
15 necessary amount of water required for induced ground water recharge
16 purposes throughout the reach shall be defined specifically by the Chief
17 Water Officer director in the order issued under this section.
18 Sec. 89. Section 46-235.01, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
19 amended to read:
20 46-235.01 A public water supplier which has received an
21 appropriation for induced ground water recharge pursuant to section
22 46-235 may, from time to time and within twenty-five years after the
23 priority assigned pursuant to section 46-233, petition the Chief Water
24 Officer department for a hearing to present evidence showing that all or
25 part of the original projection for additional water needs specified
26 pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-233 corresponds with the actual
27 use. To the extent the public water supplier is making beneficial use of
28 all or a portion of the water projected in the original application, the
29 right to use such additional water shall vest and the priority date of
30 such anticipated water use shall date back to the priority date assigned
31 pursuant to section 46-233. A public water supplier may not request such

2 application.
3 Sec. 90. Section 46-235.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
4 amended to read:
5 46-235.02 (1) Just compensation shall be required if a public water
6 supplier exercises a preference to the injury of a senior appropriator.
7 (2) Just compensation shall be provided by a public water supplier
8 to any injured junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected
9 prior to September 9, 1993, if and to the extent such injury resulted
10 from regulation of junior appropriators requested by the public water
11 supplier to provide water for any purpose other than domestic. Such
12 compensation shall not be required to a junior appropriator if the
13 regulation requested is to provide water for domestic purposes only. At
14 the time any junior appropriator whose appropriation was perfected prior
15 to September 9, 1993, is regulated at the request of a public water
16 supplier, the Chief Water Officer department shall determine for each
17 such appropriator the extent to which the regulation is for domestic
18 purposes and the extent to which it is for other purposes.
19 (3) A cause of action for just compensation shall accrue at the time
20 a junior appropriator is regulated by the Chief Water Officer department.
21 Sec. 91. Section 46-235.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-235.03 Natural resources districts shall have the authority to
24 impose restrictions or controls on public water suppliers as specified in
25 the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act. Such
26 restrictions or controls may limit the withdrawal of ground water to a
27 greater degree or extent than is otherwise permitted or allowed by a
28 permit issued by the Chief Water Officer department.
29 Sec. 92. Section 46-235.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
30 amended to read:
31 46-235.04 (1) Induced ground water recharge appropriations shall be

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 administered in the same manner as prescribed by Chapter 46, article 2,
2 for other appropriations. Appropriations for induced ground water
3 recharge may be canceled and annulled as provided in sections 46-229.02
4 to 46-229.05.
5 (2) The Chief Water Officer department may approve the transfer of
6 priority dates among water wells, including replacement water wells,
7 located within a single well field that are subject to an induced
8 recharge appropriation, or are part of an application for such an
9 appropriation, to improve the well field's efficiency of operation with
10 respect to river flow. The transfers shall be approved if the Chief Water
11 Officer department finds that (a) the transfers would not increase the
12 quantity of induced ground water recharge under the original priority
13 date or application, (b) the amount of water withdrawn from water wells
14 under the original priority date or application would not increase, (c)
15 the quantity of streamflow needed to sustain well field operation under
16 the original priority date would decrease, (d) the transfer would not
17 impair the rights of other appropriators, and (e) the transfer is in the
18 public interest in the same manner as provided in section 46-235. The
19 Chief Water Officer department may assign multiple priority dates to a
20 single water well that replaces two or more water wells which are
21 abandoned. Replacement water wells installed pursuant to this subsection
22 must be installed within the same well field as the abandoned water well.
23 Notice shall be furnished and any hearing held as provided in sections
24 46-291 and 46-292. For purposes of this subsection, single well field
25 means those contiguous tracts of land owned or leased by the applicant
26 containing two or more water wells subject to induced recharge.
27 Sec. 93. Section 46-236, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-236 An application for appropriation of water for water power

2 46-237 (1) Within six months after approval and allowance of an
3 application other than an application to appropriate public waters for
4 induced ground water recharge, the applicant shall file with in the Chief
5 Water Officer office of the department a map or plat which shall conform
6 to the rules and regulations of the department as to material, size,
7 coloring, and scale. Such map or plat shall show the source from which
8 the proposed appropriation is to be taken and all proposed dams, dikes,
9 reservoirs, canals, powerhouses, and other structures for the purpose of
10 storing, conveying, or using water for any purpose whatsoever and their
11 true courses or positions in connection with the boundary lines and
12 corners of lands which they occupy. The lands to be irrigated shall be
13 identified in the manner prescribed by the department. No rights shall be
14 deemed to have been acquired until the provisions of this section have
15 been complied with. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section,
16 failure to so comply shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all
17 rights thereunder.
18 (2) For any appropriation with a priority date earlier than 1958 but
19 for which either the appropriator has failed to comply with the
20 requirements of subsection (1) of this section or a map or plat required
21 by such subsection has been lost or destroyed through no fault of the
22 appropriator, the lack of such compliance or of such map or plat shall
23 not be the basis for an a departmental adjudication or cancellation of
24 the appropriation by the Chief Water Officer and the appropriation shall
25 not be subject to legal challenge by any party on that basis.
26 (3) The Chief Water Officer department may notify any appropriator
27 subject to subsection (2) of this section of the need to file a map or
28 plat of lands under such appropriation. Unless the Chief Water Officer
29 department grants an extension for good cause shown, the appropriator

11 intended to divert the water and the actual construction of any water
12 power plant and reservoir or reservoirs for storage in connection
13 therewith and shall vigorously, diligently, and uninterruptedly prosecute
14 such work to completion unless temporarily interrupted by some
15 unavoidable and natural cause. A failure to comply with this section
16 shall work a forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the
17 appropriation. The cost of promotion and engineering work shall not be
18 considered a part of the cost of construction, and the progress of the
19 construction work shall be such that one-tenth of the total work shall be
20 completed within one year from the date of approval of the application.
21 The construction of all work required in connection with the proposed
22 project shall be prosecuted in the manner described in this section and
23 with such a force as shall assure the average rate of constructional
24 progress necessary to complete such work or works within the time
25 stipulated in the approval of such application, notwithstanding the
26 ordinary delays and casualties that must be expected and provided
27 against. A failure to carry on the construction of either an irrigation
28 project or a water power project as outlined in this section shall work a
29 forfeiture of the appropriation and all rights under the appropriation,
30 and the Chief Water Officer department shall cancel such appropriation.
31 The Chief Water Officer department shall have free access to all records,

2 below the crest of the lowest open outlet or overflow shall be exempt
3 from subsection (1) of this section as long as there will be (a) no
4 diversion or withdrawal of water from the reservoir for any purpose other
5 than for watering range livestock and (b) no release from the reservoir
6 to provide water for a downstream diversion or withdrawal for any purpose
7 other than for watering range livestock. This subsection does not exempt

22 facility does not have the right to store water in such reservoir or
23 facility during the time that such water is required downstream in
24 ditches for direct irrigation or for any reservoir or facility holding a
25 senior right. Every person who owns, controls, or operates a reservoir or
26 intentional underground water storage facility, except political
27 subdivisions of this state, shall be required to pass through the outlets
28 of such reservoir or facility, whether presently existing or hereafter
29 constructed, a portion of the measured inflows to furnish water for

9 may take out the same amount of water, less a reasonable deduction for
10 losses in transit, to be determined by the Chief Water Officer
11 department, if no prior appropriator for beneficial use is prejudiced by
12 such diversion.
13 (6) An application for storage and recovery of water intentionally

3 appropriators shall not be adversely affected by such exchange of water.
4 (3) The owner of a storage reservoir shall have a preferred right to
5 make such application for a period of six months from the time limited
6 for the completion of such reservoir. The date of the expiration of such
7 period shall be endorsed upon the application when allowed. If an
8 application is made by a person other than the owner of a reservoir at
9 any time, the application shall not be approved by the Chief Water
10 Officer department until the applicant shows, by documentary evidence,
11 sufficient interest in such storage reservoir to entitle the applicant to
12 enough water for the purpose set forth in the application.
13 (4) Application may be made for a permit to appropriate water from a
14 storage reservoir, subject to subsection (3) of this section, or an
15 intentional underground water storage facility, subject to subsection (6)

17 wildlife if the appropriation will not prejudice the rights of any prior
18 appropriator for a beneficial use.
19 (5) An unapproved application for a permit pursuant to this section
20 which is pending on August 26, 1983, may be amended to include use of
21 stored water for intentional underground water storage.
22 Sec. 99. Section 46-250, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

26 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources, and upon its approval,
27 change the point at which the water under any water appropriation of
28 record is diverted from a natural stream or reservoir, change the line of
29 any flume, ditch, or aqueduct, or change a storage site. No reclamation
30 district or power appropriator may change the established return flow
31 point without the approval of the Chief Water Officer department.

7 withdrawal of some or all of such water for out-of-stream beneficial
8 uses, at any point without regard to any prior appropriation of water
9 from such stream, due allowance being made for losses in transit to be
10 determined by the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources.
11 The Chief Water Officer department shall monitor movement of the water by
12 measurements or other means and shall be responsible for assuring that
13 such quantities are not subsequently diverted or withdrawn by others
14 unless they are authorized to do so by the person conducting the water.
15 (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section,

19 be made on forms provided by the Chief Water Officer department.
20 Applications shall include plans and specifications detailing the
21 intended times, amounts, and streamreach locations and such other
22 information as required by the Chief Water Officer department. The water
23 subject to such a permit shall be deemed appropriated for the use
24 specified in the permit. Permitholders shall be liable for any damages
25 resulting from the overflow of such stream or channel when water so
26 conducted contributed to such overflow.
27 (3) Any person actually engaged in the construction or operation of
28 any water power plant may, without filing with the Chief Water Officer
29 department and upon payment of all damages, use any such stream or

1 of an Act of Congress approved June 17, 1902, being An Act providing for
2 the reclamation of arid lands (32 Stat. L. 388), and all acts amendatory
3 thereof and supplemental thereto. When the officers of the United States
4 Bureau of Reclamation determine that any water so developed or stored is
5 in excess of the needs of the project as then completed or is flood or
6 unused water, the United States may contract to furnish such developed,
7 stored, flood, or unused water, under the terms and conditions imposed by
8 Act of Congress and the rules and regulations of the United States, to
9 any person who may have theretofore been granted a permit to appropriate
10 a portion of the normal flow of any stream, if the water so appropriated

15 state, but not so as to raise the waters thereof above the ordinary high
16 water mark, and may take out the same again at any point desired, without
17 regard to the prior rights of others to water from the same stream; but
18 due allowance shall be made for losses in transit, the amount of such
19 allowance to be determined by the Chief Water Officer Department of
20 Natural Resources. The Chief Water Officer department shall supervise and
21 enforce the distribution of such water so delivered with like authority
22 and under the same provisions as in the case of general appropriators.
23 Sec. 107. Section 46-286, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
24 amended to read:
25 46-286 An ephemeral natural stream shall mean that portion of a
26 natural stream in which water flows only after a precipitation event or
27 when augmented by surface water runoff caused by the pumping of ground
28 water for irrigation. The portion of a natural stream that is shown as an
29 intermittent stream on the most recent United States Geological Survey
30 topographic quadrangle map published prior to July 18, 2008, shall be
31 considered an ephemeral natural stream unless the Chief Water Officer

1 Department of Natural Resources has investigated the stream and
2 determined that the stream or a reach of the stream is perennial or
3 intermittent and subject to Chapter 46, article 2. The Chief Water
4 Officer's department's determination for the purposes of this section
5 shall be adopted and promulgated in rule or regulation.
6 Sec. 108. Section 46-288, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 46-288 For purposes of this section and section 46-289, unless the
9 context otherwise requires:
10 (1) Basin of origin shall mean the river basin in which the point or
11 proposed point of diversion of water is located;
12 (2) Beneficial use shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable
13 and efficient use of water for domestic, municipal, agricultural,
14 industrial, commercial, power production, subirrigation, fish and
15 wildlife, ground water recharge, interstate compact, water quality
16 maintenance, or recreational purposes. Nothing in this subdivision shall
17 be construed to affect the preferences for use of surface water as
18 provided in section 46-204;
19 (3) Interbasin transfer shall mean the diversion of water in one
20 river basin and the transportation of such water to another river basin
21 for storage or utilization for a beneficial use; and
22 (4) River basin shall mean any of the following natural hydrologic
23 basins of the state as shown on maps located in the Department of Water,
24 Energy, and Environment Natural Resources: (a) The White River and Hat
25 Creek basin; (b) the Niobrara River basin; (c) the Platte River basin,
26 including the North Platte and South Platte River basins, except that for
27 purposes of transfer between the North and South Platte River basins each
28 shall be considered a separate river basin; (d) the Loup River basin; (e)
29 the Elkhorn River basin; (f) the Republican River basin; (g) the Little
30 Blue River basin; (h) the Big Blue River basin; (i) the Nemaha River

1 Sec. 109. Section 46-289, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 46-289 The Legislature finds, recognizes, and declares that the
4 transfer of water to outside the boundaries of a river basin may have
5 impacts on the water and other resources in the basin and that such
6 impacts differ from those caused by uses of water within the same basin
7 in part because any unused water will not be returned to the stream from
8 which it is taken for further use in that river basin. The Legislature
9 therefor recognizes the need to delineate factors for consideration by
10 the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
11 Environment Director of Natural Resources when evaluating an application
12 made pursuant to section 46-233 which involves an interbasin transfer of
13 water in order to determine whether denial of such application is
14 demanded by the public interest. Those considerations shall include, but
15 not be limited to, the following factors:
16 (1) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of the proposed
17 interbasin transfer and use;
18 (2) Any adverse impacts of the proposed interbasin transfer and use;
19 (3) Any current beneficial uses being made of the unappropriated
20 water in the basin of origin;
21 (4) Any reasonably foreseeable future beneficial uses of the water
22 in the basin of origin;
23 (5) The economic, environmental, and other benefits of leaving the
24 water in the basin of origin for current or future beneficial uses;
25 (6) Alternative sources of water supply available to the applicant;
26 and
27 (7) Alternative sources of water available to the basin of origin
28 for future beneficial uses.
29 The application shall be deemed in the public interest if the
30 overall benefits to the state and the applicant's basin are greater than
31 or equal to the adverse impacts to the state and the basin of origin. The

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 Chief Water Officer's director's order granting or denying an application
2 shall specify the reasons for such action, including a discussion of the
3 required factors for consideration, and shall document such decision by
4 reference to the hearing record, if any, and to any other sources used by
5 the Chief Water Officer director in making the decision.
6 Sec. 110. Section 46-290, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
7 amended to read:
8 46-290 (1)(a) Except as provided in this section and sections
9 46-2,120 to 46-2,130, any person having a permit to appropriate water for
10 beneficial purposes issued pursuant to sections 46-233 to 46-235,
11 46-240.01, 46-241, 46-242, or 46-637 and who desires (i) to transfer the
12 use of such appropriation to a location other than the location specified
13 in the permit, (ii) to change that appropriation to a different type of
14 appropriation as provided in subsection (3) of this section, or (iii) to
15 change the purpose for which the water is to be used under a natural-
16 flow, storage, or storage-use appropriation to a purpose not at that time
17 permitted under the appropriation shall apply for approval of such
18 transfer or change to the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
19 Resources.
20 (b) The application for such approval shall contain (i) the number
21 assigned to such appropriation by the Chief Water Officer department,
22 (ii) the name and address of the present holder of the appropriation,
23 (iii) if applicable, the name and address of the person or entity to whom
24 the appropriation would be transferred or who will be the user of record
25 after a change in the location of use, type of appropriation, or purpose
26 of use under the appropriation, (iv) the legal description of the land to
27 which the appropriation is now appurtenant, (v) the name and address of
28 each holder of a mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent consensual
29 security interest against the tract or tracts of land to which the
30 appropriation is now appurtenant, (vi) if applicable, the legal
31 description of the land to which the appropriation is proposed to be
-123-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 transferred, (vii) if a transfer is proposed, whether other sources of
2 water are available at the original location of use and whether any
3 provisions have been made to prevent either use of a new source of water
4 at the original location or increased use of water from any existing
5 source at that location, (viii) if applicable, the legal descriptions of
6 the beginning and end of the stream reach to which the appropriation is
7 proposed to be transferred for the purpose of augmenting the flows in
8 that stream reach, (ix) if a proposed transfer is for the purpose of
9 increasing the quantity of water available for use pursuant to another
10 appropriation, the number assigned to such other appropriation by the
11 Chief Water Officer department, (x) the purpose of the current use, (xi)
12 if a change in purpose of use is proposed, the proposed purpose of use,
13 (xii) if a change in the type of appropriation is proposed, the type of
14 appropriation to which a change is desired, (xiii) if a proposed transfer
15 or change is to be temporary in nature, the duration of the proposed
16 transfer or change, and (xiv) such other information as the Chief Water
17 Officer department by rule and regulation requires.
18 (2) If a proposed transfer or change is to be temporary in nature, a
19 copy of the proposed agreement between the current appropriator and the
20 person who is to be responsible for use of water under the appropriation
21 while the transfer or change is in effect shall be submitted at the same
22 time as the application.
23 (3) Regardless of whether a transfer or a change in the purpose of
24 use is involved, the following changes in type of appropriation, if found
25 by the Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water, Energy, and
26 Environment Director of Natural Resources to be consistent with section
27 46-294, may be approved subject to the following:
28 (a) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use may be
29 changed to a natural-flow appropriation for aboveground reservoir storage
30 or for intentional underground water storage;
31 (b) A natural-flow appropriation for intentional underground water
-124-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 storage may be changed to a natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-
2 stream use or for aboveground reservoir storage;
3 (c) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
4 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
5 storage may be changed to an instream appropriation subject to sections
6 46-2,107 to 46-2,119 if the Chief Water Officer director determines that
7 the resulting instream appropriation would be consistent with
8 subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of section 46-2,115;
9 (d) A natural-flow appropriation for direct out-of-stream use, for
10 aboveground reservoir storage, or for intentional underground water
11 storage may be changed to an appropriation for induced ground water
12 recharge if the Chief Water Officer director determines that the
13 resulting appropriation for induced ground water recharge would be
14 consistent with subdivisions (2)(a)(i) and (ii) of section 46-235;
15 (e) An appropriation for the manufacturing of hydropower at a
16 facility located on a natural stream channel may be permanently changed
17 in full to an instream basin-management appropriation to be held jointly
18 by the Game and Parks Commission and any natural resources district or
19 combination of natural resources districts. The beneficial use of such
20 change is to maintain the streamflow for fish, wildlife, and recreation
21 that was available from the manufacturing of hydropower prior to the
22 change. Such changed appropriation may also be utilized by the owners of
23 the appropriation to assist in the implementation of an approved
24 integrated management plan or plans developed pursuant to sections 46-714
25 to 46-718 for each natural resources district within the river basin. Any
26 such change under this section shall be subject to review under sections
27 46-229 to 46-229.06 to ensure that the beneficial uses of the change of
28 use are still being achieved; and
29 (f) The incidental underground water storage portion, whether or not
30 previously quantified, of a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation may
31 be separated from the direct-use portion of the appropriation and may be
-125-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 changed to a natural-flow or storage-use appropriation for intentional
2 underground water storage at the same location if the historic
3 consumptive use of the direct-use portion of the appropriation is
4 transferred to another location or is terminated, but such a separation
5 and change may be approved only if, after the separation and change, (i)
6 the total permissible diversion under the appropriation will not
7 increase, (ii) the projected consequences of the separation and change
8 are consistent with the provisions of any integrated management plan
9 adopted in accordance with section 46-718 or 46-719 for the geographic
10 area involved, and (iii) if the location of the proposed intentional
11 underground water storage is in a river basin, subbasin, or reach
12 designated as overappropriated in accordance with section 46-713, the
13 integrated management plan for that river basin, subbasin, or reach has
14 gone into effect, and that plan requires that the amount of the
15 intentionally stored water that is consumed after the change will be no
16 greater than the amount of the incidentally stored water that was
17 consumed prior to the change. Approval of a separation and change
18 pursuant to this subdivision (f) shall not exempt any consumptive use
19 associated with the incidental recharge right from any reduction in water
20 use required by an integrated management plan for a river basin,
21 subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated in accordance with
22 section 46-713.
23 Whenever any change in type of appropriation is approved pursuant to
24 this subsection and as long as that change remains in effect, the
25 appropriation shall be subject to the statutes, rules, and regulations
26 that apply to the type of appropriation to which the change has been
27 made.
28 (4) The Legislature finds that induced ground water recharge
29 appropriations issued pursuant to sections 46-233 and 46-235 and instream
30 appropriations issued pursuant to section 46-2,115 are specific to the
31 location identified in the appropriation. Neither type of appropriation
-126-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 shall be transferred to a different location, changed to a different type
2 of appropriation, or changed to permit a different purpose of use.
3 (5) In addition to any other purposes for which transfers and
4 changes may be approved, such transfers and changes may be approved if
5 the purpose is (a) to maintain or augment the flow in a specific stream
6 reach for any instream use that the Chief Water Officer department has
7 determined, through rules and regulations, to be a beneficial use or (b)
8 to increase the frequency that a diversion rate or rate of flow specified
9 in another valid appropriation is achieved.
10 For any transfer or change approved pursuant to subdivision (a) of
11 this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall be provided
12 with a report at least every five years while such transfer or change is
13 in effect. The purpose of such report shall be to indicate whether the
14 beneficial instream use for which the flow is maintained or augmented
15 continues to exist. If the report indicates that it does not or if no
16 report is filed within sixty days after the Chief Water Officer's
17 department's notice to the appropriator that the deadline for filing the
18 report has passed, the Chief Water Officer department may cancel the its
19 approval of the transfer or change and such appropriation shall revert to
20 the same location of use, type of appropriation, and purpose of use as
21 prior to such approval.
22 (6) A quantified or unquantified appropriation for incidental
23 underground water storage may be transferred to a new location along with
24 the direct-use appropriation with which it is recognized if the Chief
25 Water Officer director finds such transfer to be consistent with section
26 46-294 and determines that the geologic and other relevant conditions at
27 the new location are such that incidental underground water storage will
28 occur at the new location. The Chief Water Officer director may request
29 such information from the applicant as is needed to make such
30 determination and may modify any such quantified appropriation for
31 incidental underground water storage, if necessary, to reflect the
-127-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 geologic and other conditions at the new location.
2 (7) Unless an incidental underground water storage appropriation is
3 changed as authorized by subdivision (3)(f) of this section or is
4 transferred as authorized by subsection (6) of this section or subsection
5 (1) of section 46-291, such appropriation shall be canceled or modified,
6 as appropriate, by the Chief Water Officer director to reflect any
7 reduction in water that will be stored underground as the result of a
8 transfer or change of the direct-use appropriation with which the
9 incidental underground water storage was recognized prior to the transfer
10 or change.
11 (8) Any appropriation for manufacturing of hydropower changed under
12 subdivision (3)(e) of this section shall maintain the priority date and
13 preference category of the original manufacturing appropriation and shall
14 be subject to condemnation and subordination pursuant to sections 70-668
15 and 70-669. Any person holding a subordination agreement that was
16 established prior to such change of appropriation shall be entitled to
17 enter into a new subordination agreement for terms consistent with the
18 original subordination agreement at no additional cost. Any person having
19 obtained a condemnation award that was established prior to such change
20 of appropriation shall be entitled to the same benefits created by such
21 award, and any obligations created by such award shall become the
22 obligations of the new owner of the appropriation changed under this
23 section.
24 Sec. 111. Section 46-291, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
25 amended to read:
26 46-291 (1) Upon receipt of an application filed under section 46-290
27 for a transfer in the location of use of an appropriation, the Chief
28 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall review it for
29 compliance with this subsection. The Chief Water Officer Director of
30 Natural Resources may approve the application without notice or hearing
31 if he or she determines that: (a) The appropriation is used and will
-128-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 continue to be used exclusively for irrigation purposes; (b) the only
2 lands involved in the proposed transfer are (i) lands within the quarter
3 section of land to which the appropriation is appurtenant, (ii) lands
4 within such quarter section of land and one or more quarter sections of
5 land each of which is contiguous to the quarter section of land to which
6 the appropriation is appurtenant, or (iii) lands within the boundaries or
7 service area of and capable of service by the same irrigation district,
8 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
9 irrigation or canal company; (c) after the transfer, the total number of
10 acres irrigated under the appropriation will be no greater than the
11 number of acres that could legally be irrigated under the appropriation
12 prior to the transfer; (d) all the land involved in the transfer is under
13 the same ownership or is within the same irrigation district, reclamation
14 district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or
15 canal company; (e) the transfer will not result in a change in the point
16 of diversion or the point of diversion will be changed but the change
17 meets the following requirements: (i) The new point of diversion is on
18 the same named stream, the same tributary, or the same river or creek as
19 the approved point of diversion; (ii) the proposed point of diversion
20 will not move above or below an existing diversion point owned by another
21 appropriator; and (iii) the proposed point of diversion will not move
22 above or below a tributary stream or a constructed river return or a
23 constructed drain; and (f) the transfer will not diminish the water
24 supply available for or otherwise adversely affect any other surface
25 water appropriator. If transfer of an appropriation with associated
26 incidental underground water storage is approved in accordance with this
27 subsection, the associated incidental underground water storage also may
28 be transferred pursuant to this subsection as long as such transfer would
29 continue to be consistent with the requirements of this subsection. If
30 necessary, the boundaries of the incidental underground water storage
31 area may be modified to reflect any change in the location of that
-129-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 storage consistent with such a transfer. Transfers shall not be approved
2 pursuant to this subsection until the Chief Water Officer department has
3 adopted and promulgated rules and regulations establishing the criteria
4 the Chief Water Officer it will use to determine whether proposed
5 transfers are consistent with subdivision (1)(f) of this section.
6 (2) If after reviewing an application filed under section 46-290 the
7 Chief Water Officer director determines that it cannot be approved
8 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, he or she shall cause a
9 notice of such application to be posted on the department's website of
10 the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment, to be sent by certified
11 mail to each holder of a mortgage, trust deed, or other equivalent
12 consensual security interest that is identified by the applicant pursuant
13 to subdivision (1)(b)(v) of section 46-290 and to any entity owning
14 facilities currently used or proposed to be used for purposes of
15 diversion or delivery of water under the appropriation, and to be
16 published at the applicant's expense at least once each week for three
17 consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
18 each county containing lands to which the appropriation is appurtenant
19 and, if applicable, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in
20 each county containing lands to which the appropriation is proposed to be
21 transferred.
22 (3) The notice shall contain: (a) A description of the
23 appropriation; (b) the number assigned to such appropriation in the
24 records of the department; (c) the date of priority; (d) if applicable, a
25 description of the land or stream reach to which such water appropriation
26 is proposed to be transferred; (e) if applicable, the type of
27 appropriation to which the appropriation is proposed to be changed; (f)
28 if applicable, the proposed change in the purpose of use; (g) whether the
29 proposed transfer or change is to be permanent or temporary and, if
30 temporary, the duration of the proposed transfer or change; and (h) any
31 other information the Chief Water Officer director deems relevant and

2 proposed transfer or change.
3 (4) The notice shall state (a) that any interested person may object
4 to and request a hearing on the application by filing such objections in
5 writing specifically stating the grounds for each objection and (b) that
6 any such objection and request shall be filed with in the Chief Water
7 Officer office of the department within two weeks after the date of final
8 publication of the notice.
9 (5) Within the time period allowed by this section for the filing of
10 objections and requests for hearings, the county board of any county
11 containing land to which the appropriation is appurtenant and, if
12 applicable, the county board of any county containing land to which the
13 appropriation is proposed to be transferred may provide the Chief Water
14 Officer department with comments about the potential economic impacts of
15 the proposed transfer or change in such county. The filing of any such
16 comments by a county board shall not make the county a party in the
17 application process, but such comments shall be considered by the Chief
18 Water Officer director in determining pursuant to section 46-294 whether
19 the proposed transfer or change is in the public interest.
20 Sec. 112. Section 46-292, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
21 amended to read:
22 46-292 The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources may
23 hold a hearing on an application filed under section 46-290 on the Chief
24 Water Officer's its own motion and shall hold a hearing if a timely
25 request therefor is filed by any interested person in accordance with
26 section 46-291. Any such hearing shall be subject to section 61-206.
27 Sec. 113. Section 46-293, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-293 (1) The Chief Water Officer of the Department of Water,

1 determine whether the requirements of section 46-294 will be met if the
2 transfer or change is approved. The requirement of this subsection is not
3 altered when there are objectors who have become parties to the proposed
4 transfer or change, but if a hearing is called by the Chief Water Officer
5 Department of Natural Resources on the Chief Water Officer's its own
6 motion or as the result of a request therefor filed in accordance with
7 subsection (4) of section 46-291, any evidence considered by the Chief
8 Water Officer director in making such determinations shall be made a part
9 of the record of the hearing as provided in section 84-914.
10 (2) Either on his or her own motion or in response to objections or
11 comments received pursuant to subsection (4) or (5) of section 46-291,
12 the Chief Water Officer director may require the applicant to provide
13 additional information before a hearing will be scheduled or, if no
14 hearing is to be held, before the application will receive further
15 consideration. The information requested may include economic, social, or
16 environmental impact analyses of the proposed transfer or change,
17 information about the amount of water historically consumed under the
18 appropriation, copies of any plans for mitigation of any anticipated
19 adverse impacts that would result from the proposed transfer or change,
20 and such other information as the Chief Water Officer director deems
21 necessary in order to determine whether the proposed transfer or change
22 is consistent with section 46-294.

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 pursuant to section 46-293 has been provided;
2 (b) The proposed use of water after the transfer or change will be a
3 beneficial use of water;
4 (c)(i) Any requested transfer in the location of use is within the
5 same river basin as defined in section 46-288 or (ii) the river basin
6 from which the appropriation is to be transferred is tributary to the
7 river basin to which the appropriation is to be transferred;
8 (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,
9 the proposed transfer or change, alone or when combined with any new or
10 increased use of any other source of water at the original location or
11 within the same irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
12 and irrigation district, or mutual irrigation or canal company for the
13 original or other purposes, will not diminish the supply of water
14 available for or otherwise adversely affect any other water appropriator
15 and will not significantly adversely affect any riparian water user who
16 files an objection in writing pursuant to section 46-291;
17 (e) The quantity of water that is transferred for diversion or other
18 use at the new location will not exceed the historic consumptive use
19 under the appropriation or portion thereof being transferred, except that
20 this subdivision does not apply to (i) a transfer in the location of use
21 if both the current use and the proposed use are for irrigation, the

24 transfer or change in the purpose of use of a surface water irrigation
25 appropriation as provided for in subsection (3), (5), or (6) of section
26 46-290 if the transfer or change in purpose will not diminish the supply
27 of water available or otherwise adversely affect any other water
28 appropriator, adversely affect Nebraska's ability to meet its obligations
29 under a multistate agreement, or result in administration of the prior

1 (f) The appropriation, prior to the transfer or change, is not
2 subject to termination or cancellation pursuant to sections 46-229 to
3 46-229.04;
4 (g) If a proposed transfer or change is of an appropriation that has
5 been used for irrigation and is in the name of an irrigation district,
6 reclamation district, public power and irrigation district, or mutual
7 irrigation or canal company or is dependent upon any such district's or
8 company's facilities for water delivery, such district or company has
9 approved the transfer or change;
10 (h) If the proposed transfer or change is of a storage-use
11 appropriation and if the owner of that appropriation is different from
12 the owner of the associated storage appropriation, the owner of the
13 storage appropriation has approved the transfer or change;
14 (i) If the proposed transfer or change is to be permanent, either
15 (i) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the transfer or
16 change is in the same preference category established by section 46-204
17 as the purpose for which the water is to be used after the transfer or
18 change or (ii) the purpose for which the water is to be used before the
19 transfer or change and the purpose for which the water is to be used
20 after the transfer or change are both purposes for which no preferences
21 are established by section 46-204;
22 (j) If the proposed transfer or change is to be temporary, it will
23 be for a duration of no less than one year and, except as provided in
24 section 46-294.02, no more than thirty years;
25 (k) The transfer or change will not be inconsistent with any
26 applicable state or federal law and will not jeopardize the state's
27 compliance with any applicable interstate water compact or decree or
28 cause difficulty in fulfilling the provisions of any other formal state
29 contract or agreement; and
30 (l) The proposed transfer or change is in the public interest. The
31 Chief Water Officer's director's considerations relative to the public
-134-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 interest shall include, but not be limited to, (i) the economic, social,
2 and environmental impacts of the proposed transfer or change and (ii)
3 whether and under what conditions other sources of water are available
4 for the uses to be made of the appropriation after the proposed transfer
5 or change. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural Resources shall
6 adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to govern the Chief Water
7 Officer's director's determination of whether a proposed transfer or
8 change is in the public interest.
9 (2) The applicant has the burden of proving that the proposed
10 transfer or change will comply with subdivisions (1)(a) through (l) of
11 this section, except that (a) the burden is on a riparian user to
12 demonstrate his or her riparian status and to demonstrate a significant
13 adverse effect on his or her use in order to prevent approval of an
14 application and (b) if both the current use and the proposed use after a
15 transfer are for irrigation, the number of acres to be irrigated will not
16 increase after the transfer, and the location of the diversion from the
17 stream will not change, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
18 transfer will be consistent with subdivision (1)(d) of this section.
19 (3) In approving an application, the Chief Water Officer director
20 may impose any reasonable conditions deemed necessary to protect the
21 public interest, to ensure consistency with any of the other criteria in
22 subsection (1) of this section, or to provide the Chief Water Officer
23 department with information needed to properly and efficiently administer
24 the appropriation while the transfer or change remains in effect. If
25 necessary to prevent diminution of supply for any other appropriator, the
26 conditions imposed by the Chief Water Officer director shall require that
27 historic return flows be maintained or replaced in quantity, timing, and
28 location. After approval of any such transfer or change, the
29 appropriation shall be subject to all water use restrictions and
30 requirements in effect at any new location of use and, if applicable, at
31 any new diversion location. An appropriation for which a transfer or
-135-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 change has been approved shall retain the same priority date as that of
2 the original appropriation. If an approved transfer or change is
3 temporary, the location of use, purpose of use, or type of appropriation
4 shall revert to the location of use, purpose of use, or type of
5 appropriation prior to the transfer or change.
6 (4) In approving an application for a transfer, the Chief Water
7 Officer director may also authorize the overlying of water appropriations
8 on the same lands, except that if any such overlying of appropriations
9 would result in either the authorized diversion rate or the authorized
10 aggregate annual quantity that could be diverted to be greater than is
11 otherwise permitted by section 46-231, the Chief Water Officer director
12 shall limit the total diversion rate or aggregate annual quantity for the
13 appropriations overlain to the rate or quantity that he or she determines
14 is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of
15 crops on the land involved. The Chief Water Officer director may also
16 authorize a greater number of acres to be irrigated if the amount and
17 rate of water approved under the original appropriation is not increased
18 by the change of location. An increase in the number of acres to be
19 irrigated shall be approved only if (a) such an increase will not
20 diminish the supply of water available to or otherwise adversely affect
21 another water appropriator or (b) the transfer would not adversely affect
22 the water supply for any river basin, subbasin, or reach that has been
23 designated as overappropriated pursuant to section 46-713 or determined
24 to be fully appropriated pursuant to section 46-714 and (i) the number of
25 acres authorized under the appropriation when originally approved has not
26 been increased previously, (ii) the increase in the number of acres
27 irrigated will not exceed five percent of the number of acres being
28 irrigated under the permit before the proposed transfer or a total of ten
29 acres, whichever acreage is less, and (iii) all the use will be either on
30 the quarter section to which the appropriation was appurtenant before the
31 transfer or on an adjacent quarter section.

9 office of the department within six weeks after the date of final
10 publication of the notice. The appropriator of record shall, within the
11 six-week period, file written documentation of the continued use of the
12 appropriation. If no requests for hearing are received and if the Chief
13 Water Officer director is satisfied with the information provided by the

16 director shall issue an order stating such findings. If requested by any
17 interested person, or on his or her own motion based on the comments and
18 information filed, the Chief Water Officer director shall schedule a
19 hearing. If a hearing is held, the purpose of the hearing shall be to
20 receive evidence regarding whether the water appropriated under the

23 hearing shall proceed under the rebuttable presumption that the
24 appropriation continues to provide the beneficial uses for which the
25 permit was granted and that the appropriation is in the public interest.
26 After the hearing, the Chief Water Officer director may by order modify
27 or cancel, in whole or in part, the instream appropriation.

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 the continued economic prosperity and well-being of the state, including
2 the present and future development of agriculture in the state;
3 (2) Hydrologically connected ground water and surface water may need
4 to be managed differently from unconnected ground water and surface water
5 in order to permit equity among water users and to optimize the
6 beneficial use of interrelated ground water and surface water supplies;
7 (3) Natural resources districts already have significant legal
8 authority to regulate activities which contribute to declines in ground
9 water levels and to nonpoint source contamination of ground water and are
10 the preferred entities to regulate, through ground water management
11 areas, ground water related activities which are contributing to or are,
12 in the reasonably foreseeable future, likely to contribute to conflicts
13 between ground water users and surface water appropriators or to water
14 supply shortages in fully appropriated or overappropriated river basins,
15 subbasins, or reaches;
16 (4) The Legislature recognizes that ground water use or surface
17 water use in one natural resources district may have adverse affects on
18 water supplies in another district or in an adjoining state. The
19 Legislature intends and expects that each natural resources district
20 within which water use is causing external impacts will accept
21 responsibility for ground water management in accordance with the
22 Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act in the same manner
23 and to the same extent as if the impacts were contained within that
24 district;

19 an annual evaluation for a river basin, subbasin, or reach during the
20 four years following a status change in such river basin, subbasin, or
21 reach under subsection (12) of section 46-714.
22 (b) Based on the information reviewed in the evaluation process, the
23 Chief Water Officer department shall arrive at a preliminary conclusion
24 for each river basin, subbasin, and reach evaluated as to whether such
25 river basin, subbasin, or reach presently is fully appropriated without
26 the initiation of additional uses. The Chief Water Officer department
27 shall also determine if and how such preliminary conclusion would change
28 if no additional legal constraints were imposed on future development of
29 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water and reasonable
30 projections are made about the extent and location of future development
31 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach.

1 (c) In addition to the conclusion about whether a river basin,
2 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
3 department shall include in the report, for informational purposes only,
4 a summary of relevant data provided by any interested party concerning
5 the social, economic, and environmental impacts of additional
6 hydrologically connected surface water and ground water uses on resources
7 that are dependent on streamflow or ground water levels but are not
8 protected by appropriations or regulations.
9 (d) In preparing the report, the Chief Water Officer department
10 shall rely on the best scientific data, information, and methodologies
11 readily available to ensure that the conclusions and results contained in
12 the report are reliable. In its report, the Chief Water Officer
13 department shall provide sufficient documentation to allow these data,
14 information, methodologies, and conclusions to be independently
15 replicated and assessed. Upon request by the Chief Water Officer
16 department, state agencies, natural resources districts, irrigation
17 districts, reclamation districts, public power and irrigation districts,
18 mutual irrigation companies, canal companies, municipalities, and other
19 water users and stakeholders shall provide relevant data and information
20 in their possession. The Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
21 Resources shall specify by rule and regulation the types of scientific
22 data and other information that will be considered for making the
23 preliminary determinations required by this section.
24 (2)(a) The Chief Water Officer department shall complete a
25 reevaluation of a river basin, subbasin, or reach for which an integrated
26 management plan has been or is being prepared if the Chief Water Officer
27 department has reason to believe that a reevaluation might lead to a
28 different determination about whether such river basin, subbasin, or
29 reach is fully appropriated or overappropriated. A decision to reevaluate
30 may be reached by the Chief Water Officer department on its own or in
31 response to a petition filed with the Chief Water Officer department by
-215-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 any interested person. To be considered sufficient to justify a
2 reevaluation, a petition shall be accompanied by supporting information
3 showing that (i) new scientific data or other information relevant to the
4 determination of whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
5 appropriated or overappropriated has become available since the last
6 evaluation of such river basin, subbasin, or reach, (ii) the Chief Water
7 Officer department relied on incorrect or incomplete information when the
8 river basin, subbasin, or reach was last evaluated, or (iii) the Chief
9 Water Officer department erred in the its interpretation or application
10 of the information available when the river basin, subbasin, or reach was
11 last evaluated. If a petition determined by the Chief Water Officer
12 department to be sufficient is filed before July 1 of any year, the
13 reevaluation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved shall be
14 included in the next annual report prepared in accordance with subsection
15 (1) of this section. If any such petition is filed on or after July 1 of
16 any year, the Chief Water Officer department may defer the reevaluation
17 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach involved until the second annual
18 report after such filing.
19 (b) If the reevaluation results in a different determination by the
20 Chief Water Officer department, then (i) the Chief Water Officer
21 department shall notify, by certified mail, the affected natural
22 resources districts and any irrigation district, public power and
23 irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
24 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
25 subbasin, or reach of the preliminary change in the determination and
26 (ii) the Chief Water Officer department shall hold one or more public
27 hearings not more than ninety days after the publication of the notice
28 required in subdivision (b)(i) of this subsection. Notice of the hearings
29 shall be provided in the same manner as the notice required in subsection
30 (1) of section 46-714. Any interested person may appear at the hearing
31 and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
-216-

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
2 (c) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subdivision (b)
3 of this subsection, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
4 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
5 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
6 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach.
7 (3) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed fully
8 appropriated if the Chief Water Officer department determines based upon
9 the its evaluation conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
10 and information presented at the hearing pursuant to subsection (4) of
11 section 46-714 that then-current uses of hydrologically connected surface
12 water and ground water in the river basin, subbasin, or reach cause or
13 will in the reasonably foreseeable future cause (a) the surface water
14 supply to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the beneficial or
15 useful purposes for which existing natural-flow or storage appropriations
16 were granted and the beneficial or useful purposes for which, at the time
17 of approval, any existing instream appropriation was granted, (b) the
18 streamflow to be insufficient to sustain over the long term the
19 beneficial uses from wells constructed in aquifers dependent on recharge
20 from the river or stream involved, or (c) reduction in the flow of a
21 river or stream sufficient to cause noncompliance by Nebraska with an
22 interstate compact or decree, other formal state contract or agreement,
23 or applicable state or federal laws.
24 (4)(a) A river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed
25 overappropriated if, on July 16, 2004, the river basin, subbasin, or
26 reach is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among three or
27 more states and if, prior to such date, the Chief Water Officer
28 department has declared a moratorium on the issuance of new surface water
29 appropriations in such river basin, subbasin, or reach and has requested
30 each natural resources district with jurisdiction in the affected area in
31 such river basin, subbasin, or reach either (i) to close or to continue

5 suspend or to continue in effect a temporary suspension, previously
6 adopted pursuant to section 46-656.28 as such section existed prior to
7 July 16, 2004, on the drilling of new water wells in all or part of such
8 river basin, subbasin, or reach.
9 (b) Within sixty days after July 16, 2004, the Chief Water Officer
10 department shall designate which river basins, subbasins, or reaches are
11 overappropriated. The designation shall include a description of the
12 geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer department has
13 determined that surface water and ground water are hydrologically
14 connected and the criteria used to make such determination.
15 Sec. 213. Section 46-714, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 46-714 (1) Whenever the Chief Water Officer Department of Natural
18 Resources makes a preliminary determination that a river basin, subbasin,
19 or reach not previously designated as overappropriated and not previously
20 determined to be fully appropriated has become fully appropriated, the
21 Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate stay on the
22 issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use appropriations
23 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water Officer
24 department shall also provide prompt notice of such preliminary
25 determination to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to
26 each natural resources district that encompasses any of the geographic
27 area involved. Such notice to natural resources districts shall be by
28 certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the manager of the
29 natural resources district or his or her designee and shall include the

13 (2) If the Chief Water Officer department preliminarily determines a
14 river basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated and has
15 identified the existence of hydrologically connected surface water and
16 ground water in such river basin, subbasin, or reach, stays shall also be
17 imposed:
18 (a) On the construction of any new water well in the area covered by
19 the determination unless a permit with conditions imposed by the natural
20 resources district has been issued prior to the determination. Such
21 conditions shall meet the objectives of subsection (4) of section 46-715
22 and may include, but are not limited to, conditions in accordance with
23 subsection (6) of section 46-739. Any well constructed pursuant to such
24 permit shall be completed in accordance with section 46-738; and
25 (b) On the use of an existing water well or an existing surface
26 water appropriation in the affected area to increase the number of acres
27 historically irrigated.

1 hearing and present written or oral testimony and evidence concerning the
2 appropriation status of the river basin, subbasin, or reach, the Chief
3 Water Officer's department's preliminary conclusions about the extent of
4 the area within which the surface water and ground water supplies for the
5 river basin, subbasin, or reach are determined to be hydrologically
6 connected, and whether the stays on new uses should be terminated.
7 (5) Within thirty days after the final hearing under subsection (4)
8 of this section, the Chief Water Officer department shall notify the
9 appropriate natural resources districts of the Chief Water Officer's
10 department's final determination with respect to the appropriation status
11 of the river basin, subbasin, or reach. If the final determination is
12 that the river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the Chief
13 Water Officer department, at the same time, shall (a) decide whether to
14 continue or to terminate the stays on new surface water uses and on
15 increases in the number of surface water irrigated acres and (b)
16 designate the geographic area within which the Chief Water Officer
17 department considers surface water and ground water to be hydrologically
18 connected in the river basin, subbasin, or reach and describe the methods
19 and criteria used in making that determination. The Chief Water Officer
20 department shall provide notice of its decision to continue or terminate
21 the stays in the same manner as the notice required by subsection (1) of

LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 resources district shall decide (a) whether to terminate the stay on new
2 water wells in all or part of the natural resources district subject to
3 the stay and (b) whether to terminate the stay on increases in ground
4 water irrigated acres. If the natural resources district decides not to
5 terminate the stay on new water wells in any geographic area, it shall
6 also decide whether to exempt from such stay the construction of water
7 wells for which permits were issued prior to the issuance of the stay but
8 for which construction had not begun prior to issuance of the stay. If
9 construction of water wells for which permits were issued prior to the
10 stay is allowed, all permits that were valid when the stay went into
11 effect shall be extended by a time period equal to the length of the
12 stay.
13 (8) Whenever the Chief Water Officer department designates a river
14 basin, subbasin, or reach as overappropriated, each previously declared
15 moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in the
16 river basin, subbasin, or reach shall continue in effect. The Chief Water
17 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of such designation
18 to all licensed water well contractors in the state and to each natural
19 resources district that encompasses any of the geographic area involved.

2 subsection (8) of this section in a newspaper of statewide circulation,
3 there shall also be stays (a) on the construction of any new water well
4 in the hydrologically connected area if such construction has not
5 commenced prior to such date and if no permit for construction of the
6 water well has been issued previously by either the Chief Water Officer
7 department or the natural resources district, (b) on the use of an
8 existing water well in the hydrologically connected area to increase the
9 number of acres historically irrigated, and (c) on the use of an existing
10 surface water appropriation to increase the number of acres historically
11 irrigated in the affected area.
12 (10) Within ninety days after a designation by the Chief Water
13 Officer department of a river basin, subbasin, or reach as
14 overappropriated, a natural resources district that encompasses any of
15 the hydrologically connected area designated by the Chief Water Officer
16 department may hold one or more public hearings on the question of
17 whether to terminate the stays on (a) the construction of new water wells
18 within all or part of its portion of the hydrologically connected area,
19 (b) the issuance of new water well construction permits in such area, or
20 (c) the increase in ground water irrigated acres in such area. Notice of
21 any hearing for such purpose shall be provided pursuant to section
22 46-743. Prior to the scheduling of a natural resources district hearing
23 on the question of whether to terminate any such stay, the Chief Water
24 Officer department and the affected natural resources district shall
25 consult with any irrigation district, reclamation district, public power
26 and irrigation district, mutual irrigation company, canal company, or
27 municipality that relies on water from the affected river basin,
28 subbasin, or reach and with other water users and stakeholders as deemed
29 appropriate by the Chief Water Officer department or the natural
30 resources district.

9 section 46-713 and has determined that the affected river basin,
10 subbasin, or reach is not fully appropriated or overappropriated, or (e)
11 the stay expires pursuant to this subsection. Such stay may be imposed
12 initially for not more than three years following the Chief Water
13 Officer's department's designation of the river basin, subbasin, or reach
14 as overappropriated or the Chief Water Officer's department's final
15 determination that a river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully
16 appropriated and may be extended thereafter on an annual basis by
17 agreement of the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
18 resources district for not more than two additional years if necessary to
19 allow the development, adoption, and implementation of an integrated
20 management plan pursuant to sections 46-715 to 46-719.
21 (12)(a) For purposes of this subsection, (i) a status change occurs
22 when a preliminary or final determination that a river basin, subbasin,
23 or reach is fully appropriated is reversed by the Chief Water Officer
24 department or by judicial determination and such river basin, subbasin,
25 or reach is determined not to be fully appropriated and (ii) the
26 hydrologically connected area means the geographic area within which the
27 Chief Water Officer department considers surface water and ground water
28 in such river basin, subbasin, or reach to be hydrologically connected.
29 (b) If a status change occurs, any stays previously in force by the
30 Chief Water Officer department or affected natural resources districts
31 shall remain in force until the stays imposed under this subsection are

1 in place and the Chief Water Officer department shall place an immediate
2 stay on the issuance of any new natural-flow, storage, or storage-use
3 appropriations in the river basin, subbasin, or reach. The Chief Water
4 Officer department shall also provide prompt notice of the status change
5 in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. Immediately upon
6 receipt of the notice by the affected natural resources district, there
7 shall be stays imposed as set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this
8 section, subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (3) of this
9 section. The stays imposed pursuant to this subsection shall remain in
10 effect within each affected natural resources district until such
11 district adopts rules and regulations in accordance with subdivision (c),
12 (d), or (e) of this subsection.
13 (c) Upon receipt of notice of a status change, each affected natural
14 resources district shall adopt rules and regulations within one hundred
15 twenty days after receipt of such notice for the prioritization and
16 granting of water well permits within the hydrologically connected area
17 for the four-year period following the status change. Nothing in this
18 subsection shall be construed to supersede the authority provided to
19 natural resources districts under subsection (2) of section 46-707 and
20 subdivisions (1)(f) and (1)(m) of section 46-739.

1 forth in subdivision (d)(ii) of this subsection, based on the most recent
2 basin determination.
3 (e) If the proposed new number of acres is not approved by the Chief
4 Water Officer department within the applicable time period as provided in
5 subdivision (d) of this subsection, the affected natural resources
6 districts shall adopt rules and regulations that allow water well permits
7 to be issued that will result in no more than two thousand five hundred
8 irrigated acres or that will result in an increase of not more than
9 twenty percent of all historically irrigated acres within the
10 hydrologically connected area of each natural resources district within
11 the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach, whichever is less, for each
12 calendar year of the four-year period following the date of the
13 determination described in this subsection. Each affected natural
14 resources district may, after the initial four-year period has expired,
15 annually determine whether water well permit limitations should continue
16 and may enforce such limitations.
17 (f) During the four-year period following the status change, the
18 Chief Water Officer department shall ensure that any new appropriation
19 granted will not cause the basin, subbasin, or reach to be fully
20 appropriated based on the most recent basin determination. The Chief
21 Water Officer department, pursuant to its rules and regulations adopted
22 and promulgated under the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection
23 Act, shall not issue new natural flow surface water appropriations for
24 irrigation, within the river basin, subbasin, or reach affected by the
25 status change, that will result in a net increase of more than eight
26 hundred thirty-four irrigated acres in each natural resources district
27 during each calendar year of the four-year period following the date of
28 the determination described in this subsection.

3 subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, the natural resources districts
4 encompassing such river basin, subbasin, or reach and the Chief Water
5 Officer department shall jointly develop an integrated management plan
6 for such river basin, subbasin, or reach. The plan shall be completed,
7 adopted, and take effect within three years after such designation or
8 final determination unless the Chief Water Officer department and the
9 natural resources districts jointly agree to an extension of not more
10 than two additional years.
11 (b) A natural resources district encompassing a river basin,
12 subbasin, or reach that has not been designated as overappropriated or
13 has not been finally determined to be fully appropriated may, jointly
14 with the Chief Water Officer department, develop an integrated management
15 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach located within the
16 district. The district shall notify the Chief Water Officer department of
17 its intention to develop an integrated management plan which shall be
18 developed and adopted according to sections 46-715 to 46-717 and
19 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-718. The objective of an integrated
20 management plan under this subdivision is to manage such river basin,
21 subbasin, or reach to achieve and sustain a balance between water uses
22 and water supplies for the long term. If a district develops an
23 integrated management plan under this subdivision and the Chief Water
24 Officer department subsequently determines the affected river basin,
25 subbasin, or reach to be fully appropriated, the Chief Water Officer
26 department and the affected natural resources district may amend the
27 integrated management plan.
28 (2) In developing an integrated management plan, the effects of
29 existing and potential new water uses on existing surface water
30 appropriators and ground water users shall be considered. An integrated
31 management plan shall include the following: (a) Clear goals and
-228-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 objectives with a purpose of sustaining a balance between water uses and
2 water supplies so that the economic viability, social and environmental
3 health, safety, and welfare of the river basin, subbasin, or reach can be
4 achieved and maintained for both the near term and the long term; (b) a
5 map clearly delineating the geographic area subject to the integrated
6 management plan; (c) one or more of the ground water controls authorized
7 for adoption by natural resources districts pursuant to section 46-739;
8 (d) one or more of the surface water controls authorized for adoption by
9 the Chief Water Officer department pursuant to section 46-716; and (e) a
10 plan to gather and evaluate data, information, and methodologies that
11 could be used to implement sections 46-715 to 46-717, increase
12 understanding of the surface water and hydrologically connected ground
13 water system, and test the validity of the conclusions and information
14 upon which the integrated management plan is based. The plan may also
15 provide for utilization of any applicable incentive programs authorized
16 by law. Nothing in the integrated management plan for a fully
17 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach shall require a natural
18 resources district to regulate ground water uses in place at the time of
19 the Chief Water Officer's department's preliminary determination that the
20 river basin, subbasin, or reach is fully appropriated, unless such
21 regulation is necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of a basin-
22 wide plan pursuant to section 46-755, but a natural resources district
23 may voluntarily adopt such regulations. The applicable natural resources
24 district may decide to include all water users within the district
25 boundary in an integrated management plan.
26 (3) In order to provide a process for economic development
27 opportunities and economic sustainability within a river basin, subbasin,
28 or reach, the integrated management plan shall include clear and
29 transparent procedures to track depletions and gains to streamflows
30 resulting from new, retired, or other changes to uses within the river
31 basin, subbasin, or reach. The procedures shall:
-229-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (a) Utilize generally accepted methodologies based on the best
2 available information, data, and science;
3 (b) Include a generally accepted methodology to be utilized to
4 estimate depletions and gains to streamflows, which methodology includes
5 location, amount, and time regarding gains to streamflows as offsets to
6 new uses;
7 (c) Identify means to be utilized so that new uses will not have
8 more than a de minimis effect upon existing surface water users or ground
9 water users;
10 (d) Identify procedures the natural resources district and the Chief
11 Water Officer department will use to report, consult, and otherwise share
12 information on new uses, changes in uses, or other activities affecting
13 water use in the river basin, subbasin, or reach;
14 (e) Identify, to the extent feasible, potential water available to
15 mitigate new uses, including, but not limited to, water rights leases,
16 interference agreements, augmentation projects, conjunctive use
17 management, and use retirement;
18 (f) Develop, to the extent feasible, an outline of plans after
19 consultation with and an opportunity to provide input from irrigation
20 districts, public power and irrigation districts, reclamation districts,
21 municipalities, other political subdivisions, and other water users to
22 make water available for offset to enhance and encourage economic
23 development opportunities and economic sustainability in the river basin,
24 subbasin, or reach; and
25 (g) Clearly identify procedures that applicants for new uses shall
26 take to apply for approval of a new water use and corresponding offset.
27 Nothing in this subsection shall require revision or amendment of an
28 integrated management plan approved on or before August 30, 2009.
29 (4) The ground water and surface water controls proposed for
30 adoption in the integrated management plan pursuant to subsection (1) of
31 this section shall, when considered together and with any applicable
-230-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 incentive programs, (a) be consistent with the goals and objectives of
2 the plan, (b) be sufficient to ensure that the state will remain in
3 compliance with applicable state and federal laws and with any applicable
4 interstate water compact or decree or other formal state contract or
5 agreement pertaining to surface water or ground water use or supplies,
6 and (c) protect the ground water users whose water wells are dependent on
7 recharge from the river or stream involved and the surface water
8 appropriators on such river or stream from streamflow depletion caused by
9 surface water uses and ground water uses begun, in the case of a river
10 basin, subbasin, or reach designated as overappropriated or preliminarily
11 determined to be fully appropriated in accordance with section 46-713,
12 after the date of such designation or preliminary determination.
13 (5)(a) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
14 overappropriated, when the designated area lies within two or more
15 natural resources districts, the Chief Water Officer department and the
16 affected natural resources districts shall jointly develop a basin-wide
17 plan for the area designated as overappropriated. Such plan shall be
18 developed using the consultation and collaboration process described in
19 subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall be developed concurrently with
20 the development of the integrated management plan required pursuant to
21 subsections (1) through (4) of this section, and shall be designed to
22 achieve, in the incremental manner described in subdivision (d) of this
23 subsection, the goals and objectives described in subsection (2) of this
24 section. The basin-wide plan shall be adopted after hearings by the Chief
25 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
26 (b) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach designated as
27 overappropriated and subject to this subsection, the Chief Water Officer
28 department and each natural resources district encompassing such river
29 basin, subbasin, or reach shall jointly develop an integrated management
30 plan for such river basin, subbasin, or reach pursuant to subsections (1)
31 through (4) of this section. Each integrated management plan for a river
-231-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 basin, subbasin, or reach subject to this subsection shall be consistent
2 with any basin-wide plan developed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
3 subsection. Such integrated management plan shall be developed after
4 consultation and collaboration with irrigation districts, reclamation
5 districts, public power and irrigation districts, mutual irrigation
6 companies, canal companies, and municipalities that rely on water from
7 within the affected area and that, after being notified of the
8 commencement of the plan development process, indicate in writing their
9 desire to participate in such process. In addition, the Chief Water
10 Officer department or the affected natural resources districts may
11 include designated representatives of other stakeholders. If agreement is
12 reached by all parties involved in such consultation and collaboration
13 process, the Chief Water Officer department and each natural resources
14 district shall adopt the agreed-upon integrated management plan. If
15 agreement cannot be reached by all parties involved, the integrated
16 management plan shall be developed and adopted by the Chief Water Officer
17 department and the affected natural resources district pursuant to
18 sections 46-715 to 46-718 or by the Interrelated Water Review Board
19 pursuant to section 46-719.
20 (c) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
21 shall identify the overall difference between the current and fully
22 appropriated levels of development. Such determination shall take into
23 account cyclical supply, including drought, identify the portion of the
24 overall difference between the current and fully appropriated levels of
25 development that is due to conservation measures, and identify the
26 portions of the overall difference between the current and fully
27 appropriated levels of development that are due to water use initiated
28 prior to July 1, 1997, and to water use initiated on or after such date.
29 (d) Any integrated management plan developed under this subsection
30 shall adopt an incremental approach to achieve the goals and objectives
31 identified under subdivision (2)(a) of this section using the following
-232-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 steps:
2 (i) The first incremental goals shall be to address the impact of
3 streamflow depletions to (A) surface water appropriations and (B) water
4 wells constructed in aquifers dependent upon recharge from streamflow, to
5 the extent those depletions are due to water use initiated after July 1,
6 1997, and, unless an interstate cooperative agreement for such river
7 basin, subbasin, or reach is no longer in effect, to prevent streamflow
8 depletions that would cause noncompliance by Nebraska with such
9 interstate cooperative agreement. During the first increment, the Chief
10 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts
11 shall also pursue voluntary efforts, subject to the availability of
12 funds, to offset any increase in streamflow depletive effects that occur
13 after July 1, 1997, but are caused by ground water uses initiated prior
14 to such date. The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
15 resources districts may also use other appropriate and authorized
16 measures for such purpose;
17 (ii) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
18 resources districts may amend an integrated management plan subject to
19 this subsection (5) as necessary based on an annual review of the
20 progress being made toward achieving the goals for that increment;
21 (iii) During the ten years following adoption of an integrated
22 management plan developed under this subsection (5) or during the ten
23 years after the adoption of any subsequent increment of the integrated
24 management plan pursuant to subdivision (d)(iv) of this subsection, the
25 Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
26 district shall conduct a technical analysis of the actions taken in such
27 increment to determine the progress towards meeting the goals and
28 objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The
29 analysis shall include an examination of (A) available supplies and
30 changes in long-term availability, (B) the effects of conservation
31 practices and natural causes, including, but not limited to, drought, and
-233-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (C) the effects of the plan on reducing the overall difference between
2 the current and fully appropriated levels of development identified in
3 subdivision (5)(c) of this section. The analysis shall determine whether
4 a subsequent increment is necessary in the integrated management plan to
5 meet the goals and objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this
6 section and reduce the overall difference between the current and fully
7 appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision (5)(c) of
8 this section;
9 (iv) Based on the determination made in subdivision (d)(iii) of this
10 subsection, the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
11 resources districts, utilizing the consultative and collaborative process
12 described in subdivision (b) of this subsection, shall if necessary
13 identify goals for a subsequent increment of the integrated management
14 plan. Subsequent increments shall be completed, adopted, and take effect
15 not more than ten years after adoption of the previous increment; and
16 (v) If necessary, the steps described in subdivisions (d)(ii)
17 through (iv) of this subsection shall be repeated until the Chief Water
18 Officer department and the affected natural resources districts agree
19 that the goals and objectives identified pursuant to subsection (2) of
20 this section have been met and the overall difference between the current
21 and fully appropriated levels of development identified in subdivision
22 (5)(c) of this section has been addressed so that the river basin,
23 subbasin, or reach has returned to a fully appropriated condition.
24 (6) In any river basin, subbasin, or reach that is designated as
25 fully appropriated or overappropriated and whenever necessary to ensure
26 that the state is in compliance with an interstate compact or decree or a
27 formal state contract or agreement, the Chief Water Officer department,
28 in consultation with the affected districts, shall forecast on an annual
29 basis the maximum amount of water that may be available from streamflow
30 for beneficial use in the short term and long term in order to comply
31 with the requirement of subdivision (4)(b) of this section. This forecast
-234-

2 Sec. 215. Section 46-716, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
3 amended to read:
4 46-716 (1) The surface water controls that may be included in an
5 integrated management plan and may be adopted by the Chief Water Officer
6 Department of Natural Resources are: (a) Increased monitoring and
7 enforcement of surface water diversion rates and amounts diverted
8 annually; (b) the prohibition or limitation of additional surface water
9 appropriations; (c) requirements for surface water appropriators to apply
10 or utilize reasonable conservation measures consistent with good
11 husbandry and other requirements of section 46-231 and consistent with
12 reasonable reliance by other surface water or ground water users on
13 return flows or on seepage to the aquifer; and (d) other reasonable
14 restrictions on surface water use which are consistent with the intent of
15 section 46-715 and the requirements of section 46-231.
16 (2) If during the development of the integrated management plan the
17 Chief Water Officer department determines that surface water
18 appropriators should be required to apply or utilize conservation
19 measures or that other reasonable restrictions on surface water use need
20 to be imposed, the Chief Water Officer's department's portion of the
21 integrated management plan shall allow the affected surface water
22 appropriators and surface water project sponsors a reasonable amount of
23 time, not to exceed one hundred eighty days unless extended by the Chief
24 Water Officer department, to identify the conservation measures to be
25 applied or utilized, to develop a schedule for such application and
26 utilization, and to comment on any other proposed restrictions.
27 Sec. 216. Section 46-717, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
28 amended to read:
29 46-717 (1) In developing an integrated management plan, the Chief
30 Water Officer Department of Natural Resources and the affected natural
31 resources districts shall utilize the best scientific data and other

1 information available and shall review and consider any rules and
2 regulations in effect in any existing ground water management area that
3 encompasses all or part of the geographic area to be encompassed by the
4 plan. Consideration shall be given to the applicable scientific data and
5 other information relied upon by the Chief Water Officer department in
6 preparing the annual report required by section 46-713 and to other types
7 of data and information that may be deemed appropriate by the Chief Water
8 Officer department. The Chief Water Officer department, after seeking
9 input from the affected natural resources districts, shall specify by
10 rule and regulation the types of scientific data and other information
11 that will be considered in developing an integrated management plan. The
12 natural resources districts shall adopt similar rules and regulations
13 specifying the types of scientific data and other information necessary
14 for purposes of this section. Existing research, data, studies, or any
15 other relevant information which has been compiled by or is in possession
16 of other state or federal agencies, other natural resources districts,
17 and other political subdivisions within the State of Nebraska shall be
18 utilized. State agencies and political subdivisions shall furnish
19 information or data upon request of the Chief Water Officer department or
20 any affected natural resources district. Neither the Chief Water Officer
21 department nor the natural resources districts shall be required to
22 conduct new research or to develop new computer models to prepare an
23 integrated management plan, but such new research may be conducted or new
24 computer models developed within the limits of available funding if the
25 additional information is desired by the Chief Water Officer department
26 or the affected natural resources districts.
27 (2) During preparation of an integrated management plan for a fully
28 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach or of an integrated
29 management plan under subdivision (1)(b) of section 46-715, the Chief

12 objectives of the plan for the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach,
13 (b) the proposed geographic area to be subject to controls, and (c) the
14 surface water and ground water controls and any incentive programs that
15 are proposed for adoption and implementation in the river basin,
16 subbasin, or reach, they shall schedule one or more public hearings to
17 take testimony on the proposed integrated management plan and the
18 proposed controls. Such hearings shall be held within forty-five days
19 after reaching agreement and within or in reasonable proximity to the
20 area to be affected by implementation of the integrated management plan.
21 Notice of such hearings shall be published as provided in section 46-743.
22 The costs of publishing the notice shall be shared between the Chief
23 Water Officer department and the affected natural resources districts.
24 All interested persons may appear at the hearings and present testimony
25 or provide other evidence relevant to the issues being considered.
26 (2) Within sixty days after the final hearing under this section,
27 the Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural resources
28 districts shall jointly decide whether to implement the plan proposed,
29 with or without modifications, and whether to adopt and implement the
30 surface water and ground water controls and incentive programs proposed
31 in the plan. If the Chief Water Officer department and the natural

31 enforcement of an integrated management plan may propose modification of
-241-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 the goals or objectives of that plan, of the area subject to the plan, or
2 of the surface water controls, ground water controls, or incentive
3 programs adopted to implement the plan. The Chief Water Officer
4 department and the affected natural resources districts shall utilize the
5 procedures in sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement
6 on and to adopt and implement proposed modifications. If agreement on
7 such modifications cannot be achieved utilizing those procedures, either
8 the Chief Water Officer department or an affected natural resources
9 district may notify the Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water
10 Review Board shall be appointed and convened in accordance with
11 subsection (1) of this section to resolve the dispute and, if applicable,
12 to adopt any modifications utilizing the procedures in subsection (2) of
13 this section.
14 (4) The Chief Water Officer department and the affected natural
15 resources districts may also raise objections concerning the
16 implementation or enforcement of previously adopted surface water or
17 ground water controls. The Chief Water Officer department and the
18 affected natural resources districts shall utilize the procedures in
19 sections 46-715 to 46-718 in an attempt to reach agreement on such
20 implementation or enforcement issues. If agreement on such issues cannot
21 be achieved utilizing such procedures, either the Chief Water Officer
22 department or an affected natural resources district may notify the
23 Governor of the dispute. The Interrelated Water Review Board shall be
24 appointed and convened in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
25 After permitting each party to fully express the its reasons for the its
26 position taken by each party on the disputed issues, the board may either
27 take no action or conclude (a) that one or more parties needs to modify
28 the party's its approach to implementation or enforcement and direct that
29 such modifications take place or (b) that one or more parties either has
30 not made a good faith effort to implement or enforce the portion of the
31 plan or controls for which the party it is responsible or is unable to
-242-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 fully implement and enforce such portion and that such party's
2 jurisdiction with respect to implementation and enforcement of the plan
3 and controls shall be terminated and reassigned to one or more of the
4 other parties responsible for implementation and enforcement. A decision
5 by the Interrelated Water Review Board to terminate and reassign
6 jurisdiction of any portion of the plan or controls shall take effect
7 immediately upon that decision. Notice of such reassignment shall be
8 published at least once in one or more newspapers as necessary to provide
9 general circulation in the area affected by such reassignment.
10 (5) The board may be reconvened in accordance with subsection (1) of
11 this section at a later date upon request to the Governor by the party
12 for which jurisdiction for implementation and enforcement was terminated
13 if such party desires to have the party's its jurisdiction reinstated,
14 but no such request shall be honored until at least one year after the
15 termination and not more than once per year thereafter. The board may
16 reinstate jurisdiction to that party only upon a clear showing by such
17 party that the party it is willing and able to fully implement and
18 enforce the plan and any applicable controls. Notice that a party's
19 jurisdiction has been reinstated shall be provided in the same manner
20 that notice of the earlier termination was given.
21 Sec. 219. Section 46-720, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
22 amended to read:
23 46-720 (1) The Legislature finds that, prior to July 16, 2004,
24 actions were taken by the Department of Natural Resources as it existed
25 prior to July 1, 2025, and by one or more natural resources districts
26 pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed immediately prior
27 to July 16, 2004 such date, for the purpose of addressing circumstances
28 that are, after July 16, 2004 such date, to be addressed in accordance
29 with sections 46-713 to 46-719. It is the intent of the Legislature that
30 actions taken pursuant to section 46-656.28, as such section existed
31 immediately prior to July 16, 2004, should not be negated and that
-243-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 transition from the authorities and responsibilities granted by such
2 section to those granted by sections 46-713 to 46-719 should occur in as
3 efficient a manner as possible. Such transition shall be therefor
4 governed by subsections (2) through (5) of this section, and all
5 references in such subsections to section 46-656.28 shall be construed to
6 mean section 46-656.28 as such section existed immediately prior to July
7 16, 2004.
8 (2) If, prior to July 16, 2004, (a) a natural resources district
9 requested pursuant to subsection (1) of section 46-656.28 that affected
10 appropriators, affected surface water project sponsors, and the
11 department consult and that studies and a hearing be held but (b) the
12 Director of Natural Resources, as such position existed, had has not made
13 a preliminary determination relative to that request pursuant to
14 subsection (2) of section 46-656.28, no further action on the district's
15 request shall be required of the department. If under the same
16 circumstances a temporary suspension in the drilling of certain water
17 wells has been imposed by the district pursuant to subsection (16) of
18 section 46-656.28 and remains in effect immediately prior to July 16,
19 2004, such temporary suspension shall remain in effect for thirty days
20 after the department issues its first annual report under section 46-713,
21 except that (i) such temporary suspension shall not apply to water wells
22 for which a permit has been obtained pursuant to the Municipal and Rural
23 Domestic Ground Water Transfers Permit Act and (ii) to the extent any
24 such temporary suspension is in effect for all or part of a
25 hydrologically connected area for a river basin, subbasin, or reach
26 designated as overappropriated by the department, such temporary
27 suspension shall remain in effect only until it is superseded by the
28 stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of section 46-714. To
29 the extent that any such temporary suspension applies to a geographic
30 area preliminarily considered by the department to have ground water
31 hydrologically connected to the surface water of a fully appropriated
-244-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 river basin, subbasin, or reach, such temporary suspension shall be
2 superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of
3 section 46-714.
4 (3)(a) If prior to July 16, 2004, (i) the director has made a
5 preliminary determination pursuant to subsection (2) of section 46-656.28
6 that there is reason to believe that the use of hydrologically connected
7 ground water and surface water in a specific geographic area is
8 contributing to or is in the reasonably foreseeable future likely to
9 contribute to any conflict, dispute, or difficulty listed in such
10 subsection, (ii) the director has not made a determination pursuant to
11 subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a joint action plan should not
12 be prepared, and (iii) preparation of a joint action plan pursuant to
13 subsections (5) through (9) of such section has not been completed, the
14 geographic area involved shall become subject to sections 46-713 to
15 46-719 on July 16, 2004, and the department need not evaluate such
16 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
17 46-713.
18 (b) For purposes of this subsection and section 46-714 and except as
19 otherwise provided in this section, (i) July 16, 2004, shall result in
20 the imposition in any geographic area subject to this subsection of the
21 stays required by subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714, (ii) such
22 stays shall be imposed in the manner required by such section, and (iii)
23 July 16, 2004, shall be treated as if it were the date of a departmental
24 preliminary determination pursuant to section 46-713 that such area is a
25 geographic area within which ground water and surface water of a fully
26 appropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach are hydrologically
27 connected. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if a
28 temporary suspension in the drilling of certain new water wells has
29 previously been imposed by the affected natural resources district, (A)
30 the stays on construction of new water wells and on the increase in
31 ground water irrigated acres shall be limited in geographic extent to
-245-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 only that part of the affected area within which the temporary suspension
2 was in effect unless the director determines that inclusion of additional
3 area is necessary because ground water and surface water are
4 hydrologically connected in such additional area and (B) the stays on
5 construction of certain new water wells shall not apply to a water well
6 constructed in accordance with the terms of a water well construction
7 permit approved by the district prior to July 16, 2004, unless such well
8 was subject to the district's temporary suspension. If, prior to July 16,
9 2004, the director has held a hearing on a report issued pursuant to
10 subsection (3) of section 46-656.28 but has not yet determined whether a
11 joint action plan should be prepared, no departmental hearing shall be
12 required pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-714 before a final
13 determination is made about whether the river basin, subbasin, or reach
14 involved is fully appropriated. If, prior to July 16, 2004, the director
15 has determined pursuant to subsection (4) of section 46-656.28 that a
16 joint action plan should be prepared, such determination shall have the
17 same effect as a final departmental determination pursuant to subsection
18 (5) of section 46-714 that the affected river basin, subbasin, or reach
19 is fully appropriated and no separate determination to that effect shall
20 be required. If, after July 16, 2004, the department determines that all
21 or part of the area subject to this subsection is in an overappropriated
22 river basin, subbasin, or reach, that portion of the area shall
23 thereafter be subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Ground Water
24 Management and Protection Act applicable to an overappropriated river
25 basin, subbasin, or reach and stays that have previously taken effect in
26 accordance with this subsection shall continue in effect as stays for an
27 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach without additional
28 action or publication of notice by the department. Any temporary
29 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells that has been imposed
30 in the geographic area involved by a natural resources district pursuant
31 to subsection (16) of section 46-656.28 prior to July 16, 2004, shall
-246-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 remain in effect until superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to
2 subsections (1) and (2) of section 46-714.
3 (4) If, prior to July 16, 2004, preparation of a joint action plan
4 has been completed pursuant to subsections (5) through (9) of section
5 46-656.28 but the plan has not yet been adopted pursuant to subsection
6 (11) of such section, the department need not evaluate the affected
7 geographic area in its first annual report issued pursuant to section
8 46-713. The department and the affected natural resources district shall
9 review the completed joint action plan for its compliance with sections
10 46-715 to 46-717. If the joint action plan is determined to be in
11 compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 or if agreement is reached on
12 the revisions necessary to bring it into such compliance, the department
13 and the district shall adopt the plan and implement the controls as
14 provided in section 46-718. If the joint action plan is determined not to
15 be in compliance with sections 46-715 to 46-717 and agreement on the
16 proposed plan or the proposed controls cannot be reached pursuant to
17 section 46-718, section 46-719 shall apply. Except to the extent that any
18 portion of the affected area is designated as all or part of an
19 overappropriated river basin, subbasin, or reach, any temporary
20 suspension in the drilling of certain water wells imposed in the affected
21 geographic area by a natural resources district pursuant to subsection
22 (16) of section 46-656.28 shall remain in effect until (a) the department
23 and the affected district have jointly decided to implement the plan,
24 with or without modifications, and controls have been adopted and taken
25 effect or (b) the Interrelated Water Review Board, pursuant to section
26 46-719, has adopted an integrated management plan for the affected river
27 basin, subbasin, or reach and the controls adopted by the board have
28 taken effect. To the extent that any portion of the affected area is
29 designated as all or part of an overappropriated river basin, subbasin,
30 or reach, any temporary suspension in the drilling of water wells shall
31 be superseded by the stays imposed pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) of

2 (5) If, before July 16, 2004, a joint action plan has been adopted
3 and implemented pursuant to subsections (10) through (12) of section
4 46-656.28 and is in effect immediately prior to such date, the department
5 need not evaluate the geographic area subject to the plan in the
6 department's first annual report issued pursuant to section 46-713. For
7 purposes of the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act, (a)
8 the plan adopted shall be considered an integrated management plan
9 adopted pursuant to section 46-718, (b) the management area designated
10 shall be considered an integrated management area or subarea designated
11 pursuant to section 46-718, and (c) the controls adopted shall be
12 considered controls adopted pursuant to section 46-718 and shall remain
13 in effect until amended or repealed pursuant to section 46-718 or 46-719.

21 46-722 If, as a result of information provided pursuant to section
22 46-721 or studies conducted by or otherwise available to the department
23 Department of Environment and Energy and following preliminary
24 investigation, the director Director of Environment and Energy makes a
25 preliminary determination (1) that there is reason to believe that
26 contamination of ground water is occurring or likely to occur in an area
27 of the state in the reasonably foreseeable future and (2) that the
28 natural resources district or districts in which the area is located have
29 not designated a management area or have not implemented adequate
30 controls to prevent such contamination from occurring, the department
31 shall, in cooperation with any appropriate state agency and district,

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 requirements of section 46-739.01;
2 (l) It may require, when conditions so permit, that new or
3 replacement water wells to be used for domestic or other purposes shall
4 be constructed to such a depth that they are less likely to be affected
5 by seasonal water level declines caused by other water wells in the same
6 area;
7 (m) It may close all or a portion of the management area to the
8 issuance of additional permits or may condition the issuance of
9 additional permits on compliance with other rules and regulations adopted
10 and promulgated by the district to achieve the purpose or purposes for
11 which the management area was designated; and
12 (n) It may adopt and promulgate such other reasonable rules and
13 regulations as are necessary to carry out the purpose for which a
14 management area was designated.
15 (2) In adopting, amending, or repealing any control authorized by
16 subsection (1) of this section or sections 46-740 and 46-741, the
17 district's considerations shall include, but not be limited to, whether
18 it reasonably appears that such action will mitigate or eliminate the
19 condition which led to designation of the management area or will improve
20 the administration of the area.
21 (3) Upon request by the district or when any of the controls being
22 proposed are for the purpose of integrated management of hydrologically
23 connected ground water and surface water, the Chief Water Officer
24 Director of Natural Resources shall review and comment on the adoption,
25 amendment, or repeal of any authorized control in a management area. The
26 Chief Water Officer director may hold a public hearing to consider
27 testimony regarding the control prior to commenting on the adoption,
28 amendment, or repeal of the control. The Chief Water Officer director
29 shall consult with the district and fix a time, place, and date for such
30 hearing. In reviewing and commenting on an authorized control in a
31 management area, the Chief Water Officer's director's considerations

MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 shall include, but not be limited to, those enumerated in subsection (2)
2 of this section.
3 (4) If because of varying ground water uses, varying surface water
4 uses, different irrigation distribution systems, or varying climatic,
5 hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions existing within a management
6 area the uniform application throughout such area of one or more controls
7 would fail to carry out the intent of the Nebraska Ground Water
8 Management and Protection Act in a reasonably effective and equitable
9 manner, the controls adopted by the district pursuant to this section may
10 contain different provisions for different categories of ground water use
11 or portions of the management area which differ from each other because
12 of varying climatic, hydrologic, geologic, or soil conditions. Any
13 differences in such provisions shall recognize and be directed toward
14 such varying ground water uses or varying conditions. Except as otherwise
15 provided in this section, if the district adopts different controls for
16 different categories of ground water use, those controls shall be
17 consistent with section 46-613 and shall, for each such category, be
18 uniform for all portions of the area which have substantially similar
19 climatic, hydrologic, geologic, and soil conditions.
20 (5) The district may establish different water allocations for
21 different irrigation distribution systems.
22 (6)(a) The district may establish different provisions for different
23 hydrologic relationships between ground water and surface water.
24 (b) For management areas a purpose of which is the integrated
25 management of hydrologically connected ground water and surface water,
26 the district may establish different provisions for water wells either
27 permitted or constructed before the designation of a management area for
28 integrated management of hydrologically connected ground water and
29 surface water and for water wells either permitted or constructed on or
30 after the designation date or any other later date or dates established
31 by the district. Permits for construction of new wells not completed by

1 the date of the determination of fully appropriated shall be subject to
2 any conditions imposed by the applicable natural resources district.
3 (c) For a management area in a river basin or part of a river basin
4 that is or was the subject of litigation over an interstate water compact
5 or decree in which the State of Nebraska is a named defendant, the
6 district may establish different provisions for restriction of water
7 wells constructed after January 1, 2001, if such litigation was commenced
8 before or on May 22, 2001. If such litigation is commenced after May 22,
9 2001, the district may establish different provisions for restriction of
10 water wells constructed after the date on which such litigation is
11 commenced in federal court. An appeal from a decision of the district
12 under this subdivision shall be in accordance with the hearing procedures
13 established in the Nebraska Ground Water Management and Protection Act.
14 (d) Except as otherwise authorized by law, the district shall make a
15 replacement water well as defined in section 46-602, or as further
16 defined in district rules and regulations, subject to the same provisions
17 as the water well it replaces.
18 (7) If the district has included controls delineated in subdivision
19 (1)(m) of this section in its management plan, but has not implemented
20 such controls within two years after the initial public hearing on the
21 controls, the district shall hold a public hearing, as provided in
22 section 46-712, regarding the controls before implementing them.
23 (8) In addition to the controls listed in subsection (1) of this
24 section, a district in which a management area has been designated may
25 also adopt and implement one or more of the following measures if it
26 determines that any such measures would help the district and water users
27 achieve the goals and objectives of the management area: (a) It may
28 sponsor nonmandatory educational programs; and (b) it may establish and
29 implement financial or other incentive programs. As a condition for
30 participation in an incentive program, the district may require water
31 users or landowners to enter into and perform such agreements or
-260-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 covenants concerning the use of land or water as are necessary to produce
2 the benefits for which the incentive program is established and shall
3 further condition participation upon satisfaction of the requirements of
4 section 46-739.01.
5 Sec. 235. Section 46-740, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
6 amended to read:

8 irrigation purposes in a management area, the permissible withdrawal of
9 ground water shall be allocated equally per irrigated acre except as
10 permitted by subsections (4) through (6) of section 46-739. Such
11 allocation shall specify the total number of acre-inches that are
12 allocated per irrigated acre per year, except that the district may allow
13 a ground water user to average his or her allocation over any reasonable
14 period of time. A ground water user may use his or her allocation on all
15 or any part of the irrigated acres to which the allocation applies or in
16 any other manner approved by the district.
17 (2) Except as permitted pursuant to subsections (4) through (6) of
18 section 46-739, if annual rotation or reduction of irrigated acres is
19 adopted for use of ground water for irrigation purposes in a management
20 area, the nonuse of irrigated acres shall be a uniform percentage
21 reduction of each landowner's irrigated acres within the management area
22 or a subarea of the management area. Such uniform reduction may be
23 adjusted for each landowner based upon crops grown on his or her land to
24 reflect the varying consumptive requirements between crops.
25 (3) Unless an integrated management plan, a rule, or an order is
26 established, adopted, or issued prior to November 1, 2005, no integrated
27 management plan, rule, or order shall limit the use of ground water by a
28 municipality, within an area determined by the Chief Water Officer
29 Department of Natural Resources to be fully appropriated pursuant to

6 (2) The department Department of Natural Resources shall permit a
7 requested increase in the twenty-five-acre limitation for a new livestock
8 waste control facility for an animal feeding operation for which an
9 inspection was requested prior to January 1, 2000, unless the department
10 determines that the detriment to existing water users that would result
11 from permitting the acreage increase would outweigh the detriment to the
12 operator of the animal feeding operation if the increase were not
13 permitted.
14 (3) For other new livestock waste control facilities, the department
15 Department of Natural Resources may permit an increase in the twenty-
16 five-acre limitation if it determines that (a) the applicant has no
17 reasonable way to limit the amount of the additional runoff acreage to
18 twenty-five acres or less at the proposed location of the livestock waste
19 control facility, (b) the applicant has no reasonable alternative for
20 relocating the livestock waste control facility so that the additional
21 runoff acreage would not exceed twenty-five acres, and (c) either (i) an
22 increase in the permitted runoff acreage would not reduce water supplies
23 to the detriment of existing water users or (ii)(A) the requested
24 facility is for a proposed expansion of an animal feeding operation in
25 existence and in compliance with the Livestock Waste Management Act as of
26 January 1, 2003, (B) the amount of the runoff acreage permitted in excess
27 of the twenty-five-acre limitation is not more than fifteen percent of
28 total permitted feedlot area, and (C) any detriment to existing water
29 users that would result from permitting the acreage increase would be
30 outweighed by the detriment to the operator of the animal feeding
31 operation if the increase were not permitted.

8 amended to read:
9 57-1614 (1) The commission shall take action to ensure that a
10 storage facility does not cause pollution or create a nuisance. For the
11 purposes of this provision and in applying other laws, carbon dioxide
12 streams stored, and which remain in storage under a commission permit,
13 are not a pollutant and do not constitute a nuisance.
14 (2) The commission's authority in subsection (1) of this section
15 does not limit the jurisdiction held by the Department of Water, Energy,
16 and Environment Environment and Energy. Nothing else in the Nebraska
17 Geologic Storage of Carbon Dioxide Act limits the jurisdiction held by

31 hearing.
-329-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (3) The certificate may only be issued after the commission has
2 consulted with the Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
3 Environment and Energy and the Underground Injection Control program
4 permitting authority.
5 (4) The certificate may only be issued if the storage operator:

27 responsibility to be overseen by the commission.
28 Sec. 321. Section 58-202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
29 amended to read:
30 58-202 (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
31 (a) The high cost of agricultural loans and the general
-330-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 unavailability of such loans at favorable rates and terms for farmers,
2 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises have
3 resulted in decreased crop, livestock, and business productivity and
4 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
5 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
6 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
7 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
8 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
9 citizens of this state; and
10 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
11 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
12 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
13 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
14 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
15 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
16 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
17 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
18 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
19 construction industry;
20 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
21 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
22 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
23 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
24 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
25 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
26 facilities; and
27 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
28 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
29 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
30 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
31 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
-331-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
2 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
3 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
4 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
5 food and shelter;
6 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
7 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
8 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
9 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
10 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
11 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
12 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
13 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
14 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
15 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
16 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
17 facilities to produce and supply energy;
18 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
19 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
20 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
21 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
22 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
23 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
24 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
25 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
26 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
27 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
28 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
29 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
30 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
31 suppliers.
-332-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
2 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
3 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
4 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
5 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
6 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
7 and social liabilities to the entire state;
8 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
9 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
10 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
11 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
12 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
13 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
14 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
15 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
16 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
17 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
18 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
19 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
20 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
21 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
22 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
23 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
24 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
25 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
26 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
27 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
28 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
29 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
30 and protect the public health and welfare;
31 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
-333-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
2 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
3 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
4 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
5 needed within this state; and
6 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
7 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
8 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
9 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
10 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
11 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
12 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
13 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
14 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
15 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
16 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
17 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
18 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
19 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
20 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
21 safe drinking water facilities is great;
22 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
23 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
24 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
25 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
26 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
27 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
28 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
29 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
30 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
31 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
-334-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
2 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
3 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
4 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
5 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
6 and
7 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
8 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
9 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
10 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
11 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
12 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
13 section shall prohibit the provision of loans , including loans made
14 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act, to a municipality as
15 defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction, development,
16 rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of wastewater
17 treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.
18 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
19 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
20 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
21 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
22 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
23 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
24 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
25 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
26 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
27 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
28 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
29 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
30 educational benefits and services;
31 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
-335-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
2 and
3 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
4 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
5 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
6 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
7 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
8 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
9 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
10 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
11 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
12 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
13 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
14 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
15 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
16 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
17 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
18 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
19 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
20 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
21 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
22 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
23 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
24 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
25 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
26 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
27 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
28 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
29 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
30 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
31 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
-336-

ER36 ER36
LB317 LB317
MJP - 04/10/2025 MJP - 04/10/2025
1 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
2 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
3 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
4 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
5 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
6 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
7 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
8 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
9 public health and welfare;
10 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
11 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
12 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
13 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
14 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
15 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
16 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
17 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the
18 financing of solid waste disposal areas and facilities and in the removal
19 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
20 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
21 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
22 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
23 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
24 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save

19 department shall inform the owner or operator of its approval or
20 disapproval of a plan for remedial action within one hundred twenty days
21 after receipt of a remedial action plan which contains all required
22 information. If after one hundred twenty days the department fails to

24 proposed plan shall be deemed approved; and
25 (3) The approved remedial action plan shall then be carried out by
26 the owner or operator of the tank causing the release. All expenses
27 incurred during the remedial action shall be paid by the owner or

16 action with regard to the release of a petroleum product for which the
17 responsible person has complied with the requirements of this subsection.

4 provided under this section was obtained by fraud or material
5 misrepresentation, knowing failure to disclose material information, or
6 false certification to the department. The department shall file a copy
7 of the notice of revocation of any certificate of completion in the real
8 estate records of the county in which the remedial action took place

13 obligation under this section, the affiliate shall be subject to the same
14 obligations and obtain the same level of benefits as those available to
15 the transferor under this section.
16 (5)(a) A covenant not to sue arising under subsection (1) of this
17 section, unless voided pursuant to such subsection, shall bar suit
18 against any person who acquires title to property to which a certificate
19 of completion applies for all claims of the state or any other person in
20 connection with petroleum products which were the subject of an approved
21 remedial action plan and (b) a person who purchased a site before May 31,
22 2001, is released, upon the issuance of a certificate of completion under
23 this section or upon the issuance of a no further action letter on or
24 after May 31, 2001, pursuant to section 81-15,186, from all liability to
25 the state for cleanup of contamination that was released at the site
26 covered by the certificate of completion or the no further action letter
27 before the purchase date, except as provided in subsection (4) of this
28 section, for releases or consequences that the person contributed to or
29 caused, for failure by such person to comply with the monitoring,
30 institutional, or technological controls, if any, upon which the
31 certificate of completion is conditioned, or in the event the certificate

5 a certificate of completion or a no further action letter under
6 subsection (5) of this section who is ordered by the department to take
7 remedial action shall be eligible for reimbursement as a responsible
8 person pursuant to section 66-1525 and shall not be required to pay the
9 first cost or percent of the remaining cost as provided in subsection (1)
10 of section 66-1523 unless such person contributed to or caused the
11 release or failed to comply with the monitoring, institutional, or

8 State of Nebraska, the Department of Administrative Services, the
9 University of Nebraska, and any other state agency making such purchases
10 shall give preference to and purchase products, materials, and supplies
11 which are manufactured or produced from recycled material or which can be
12 readily reused or recycled after their normal use. Preference shall also
13 be given to the purchase of corn-based biodegradable plastics and road
14 deicers, depending on the availability and suitability of such products.
15 Such preference shall not operate when it would result in the purchase of
16 products, materials, or supplies which are of inadequate quality or
17 substantially higher cost.
