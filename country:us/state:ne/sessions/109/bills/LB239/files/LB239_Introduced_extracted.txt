1 Section 1. Section 83-1216, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 83-1216 (1) The department shall administer the medicaid home and
4 community-based services waivers upon application approval by the federal
5 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The amount of funding for any
6 person receiving services shall be determined using an objective
7 assessment process developed by the department and approved by the
8 federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The objective
9 assessment formula shall be published on the department's website and
10 shall be subject to approval by the Governor's developmental disability
11 advisory board or the interested parties stakeholder group as required by
12 the access rule. The tool shall not decrease an individual's budget to
13 the point that the individual is removed from a setting. Residential
14 settings shall be provided as an option to those in funding priority one,
15 two, three, and five. Residential settings shall also be an option for
16 those in funding priority four and six under the consideration of the
17 objective assessment process. A request for a redetermination from an
18 individual, family member, or guardian under this tool shall be completed
19 within thirty days. The objective assessment process shall be person-
20 centered and designed with consideration of the individual support plan
21 developed for the individual. The objective assessment process shall have
22 an independent mediated review process which shall be administered
23 outside the department.
24 (2) The department shall provide directly or by contract service
25 coordination to Nebraska residents found to be eligible for specialized
26 services. The individual or legal representative shall decide the entity
27 that provides such specialized services.
28 (3) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department take all
29 possible steps to maximize federal funding. All Nebraska residents
30 eligible for funding for specialized services through the department
31 shall apply for and accept any federal medicaid benefits for which they

9 due to caregiver death, homelessness, or a threat to the life and safety

24 supervision of the Office of Probation Administration by the Nebraska
25 court system who are transitioning upon age nineteen with no other
26 alternatives as determined by the department to support residential
27 services necessary to pursue economic self-sufficiency;
28 (d) The fourth funding priority of the state in responding to the
29 needs of persons with developmental disabilities shall be for serving

-3-

1 education system to maintain skills and receive the day services
2 necessary to pursue economic self-sufficiency or independence consistent

14 Sec. 2. Section 83-1216.02, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

24 Services Act.
25 (2) The department shall provide services comparable to the day
26 services the individual would have received pursuant to subdivision (4)
