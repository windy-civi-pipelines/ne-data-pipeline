Supervision, Rehabilitation, and Liquidation Act for the determination of
claims.
(3) In the case of claims arising from bodily injury, sickness, or
disease, including death resulting therefrom, the amount of any such award
shall not exceed the claimant's reasonable expenses incurred for necessary
medical, surgical, X-ray, and dental services, including prosthetic devices and
necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing, and funeral services, and
any amounts actually lost by reason of claimant's inability to work and earn
wages or salary or their equivalent, but not other income, that would otherwise
have been earned in the normal course of such injured claimant's employment.
Such award may also include payments in fact made to others who are , not
members of claimant's household, which were reasonably incurred to obtain from
such other persons ordinary and necessary services for the production of income
in lieu of those services the claimant would have performed for himself or
herself had the claimant he or she not been injured. The amount of any such
award under this subsection shall be reduced by the amount the claimant is
entitled to receive as the beneficiary under any health, accident, or
disability insurance, under any salary or wage continuation program under which
the claimant he or she is entitled to benefits, or from the claimant's his or
her employer in the form of workers' compensation benefits, or any other such
benefits to which the claimant is legally entitled, and any claimant who
intentionally fails to correctly disclose a right his or her rights to any such
benefits shall forfeit all rights which the claimant he or she may have by the
provisions of the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty
Association Act.
(4) A third party having a covered claim against any insured of an
insolvent insurer may file such claim with the director pursuant to the
Nebraska Insurers Supervision, Rehabilitation, and Liquidation Act, and the
association shall process such claim in the manner specified in subsections (2)
and (3) of this section. The filing of such claim shall constitute an
unconditional general release of all liability of such insured in connection
with the claim unless the association thereafter denies the claim for the
reason that the insurance policy issued by the insolvent insurer does not
afford coverage or unless the claimant, within thirty days from the date of
filing a his or her claim with the director, files with the director a written
demand that the claim be processed in the liquidation proceedings as a claim
not covered by the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty
Association Act.
Sec. 12. Section 44-2407, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
44-2407 (1) The association shall:
(a) Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three accounts
separately and assess member insurers separately for each account in the
amounts necessary to pay (i) the obligations of the association under section
44-2406, (ii) the expenses of handling covered claims, (iii) the cost of
examinations under sections 44-2412 and 44-2413, and (iv) other expenses
authorized by the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty
Association Act. The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the
proportion that the net direct written premiums of such member insurer, on the
basis of the insurance in the account involved, bears to the net direct written
premiums of all member insurers for the same period and in the same account for
the calendar year preceding the date of the assessment. The association may
make an assessment for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other
general expenses not related to a particular impaired insurer, not to exceed
fifty dollars per member insurer in any one year. Each member insurer shall be
notified of the assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. Except
for such administrative assessment, no member insurer may be assessed in any
year, on any account, an amount greater than one percent of that member
insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year on the
kinds of insurance in the account. The association may defer, in whole or in
part, the assessment of any member insurer if the assessment would cause the
member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus
less than the minimum required for a certificate of authority by any
jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact business as
an insurer. Deferred assessments shall be paid when such payment will not
reduce capital or surplus below such required minimum amounts. Such deferred
assessments, when paid, shall be refunded to those member insurers that
received larger assessments by virtue of such deferment or, in the discretion
of any such insurer, credited against future assessments. No member insurer may
pay a dividend to shareholders or policyholders while such insurer has an
unpaid deferred assessment;
(b) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or
other persons designated by the association as a servicing facility, except
that the designation of a servicing facility shall be subject to the approval
of the director and such designation may be declined by a member insurer;
(c) Reimburse any servicing facility for obligations of the association
paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling
claims on behalf of the association and such other expenses of the association
as are authorized by the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty
Association Act;
(d) Issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this section, a
certificate of contribution in appropriate form and terms as prescribed by the
director for the amount so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal
-7-
LB326 LB326
2025 2025
dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. The
insurer may offset against its premium and related retaliatory tax liability to
this state, pursuant to sections 44-150 and 77-908, accrued with respect to
business transacted in such year, an amount equal to twenty percent of the
original face amount of the certificate of contribution, beginning with the
first calendar year after the year of issuance through the fifth calendar year
after the year of issuance. If the association recovers any sum representing
amounts previously written off by member insurers and offset against premium
and related retaliatory taxes imposed by sections 44-150 and 77-908, such
recovered sum shall be paid by the association to the director who shall handle
such funds in the same manner as provided in Chapter 77, article 9;
(e) Be deemed the insolvent insurer to the extent of the association's
obligation for covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties,
and obligations of the insolvent insurer, subject to the limitations provided
in the act, as if the insurer had not become insolvent, with the exception that
the liquidator shall retain the sole right to recover any reinsurance proceeds.
The association's rights under this section include, but are not limited to,
the right to pursue and retain salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid
covered claim obligations to the extent paid by the guaranty fund; and
(f) Have access to impaired or insolvent insurer records. The
rehabilitator or liquidator of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall permit
access by the association or its authorized representatives, and by any similar
organization in another state or its authorized representatives, to the
impaired or insolvent insurer's records which are necessary for the association
or such similar organization in carrying out its functions with regard to
covered claims. In addition, the rehabilitator or liquidator shall provide the
association or its representative or such similar organization with copies of
such records upon the request and at the expense of the association or similar
organization. In providing the information set forth in this subdivision, the
association or its authorized representatives and the rehabilitator or
liquidator of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall execute such agreements as
are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the information provided; and
(g) Have the right to review and contest settlements, releases,
compromises, waivers, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its
insureds were parties prior to the entry of the order of liquidation. In an
action to enforce settlements, releases, and judgments to which the insolvent
insurer or its insureds were parties prior to the entry of the order of
liquidation, the association shall have the right to assert the following
defenses described in subsections (2) through (5) of this section, in addition
to the defenses available to the insurer.
(2) The association is not bound by a settlement, release, compromise, or
waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment entered against
an insured or the insurer by consent or through failure to exhaust all appeals,
if the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment was (a) executed,
or entered into, within one hundred twenty days prior to the entry of an order
of liquidation, and the insured or the insurer did not use reasonable care when
it entered into the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment, or
did not pursue all reasonable appeals of an adverse judgment or (b) executed by
or taken against an insured or the insurer based on default, fraud, collusion,
or the insurer's failure to defend.
(3) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the association is not
bound by a settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment for the reason
described in subdivision (2)(a) or (b) of this section, the settlement,
release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall be set aside, and the
association shall be permitted to defend any covered claim on the merits. The
settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall not be considered as
evidence of liability or damages in connection with any claim brought against
the association or any other party.
(4) The association shall have the right to assert any statutory defenses
or rights of offset against any settlement, release, compromise, or waiver
executed by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment taken against the
insured or the insurer.
(5) As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision,
verdict, or finding based on default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to
defend, the association, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the insured,
may apply to have the judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding set aside
by the same court or administrator that entered the judgment, order, decision,
verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend the claim on the merits.
(6) (2) The association may:
(a) Appear in, defend, and appeal any action;
(b) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims,
provide covered policy benefits and services, and appoint and direct other
service providers for covered services and perform other duties of the
association;
(c) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of the Nebraska Property
and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act in accord with the plan of
operation;
(d) Sue or be sued, and such power to sue shall include the power and
right to intervene as a party before any court that has jurisdiction over an
insolvent insurer as defined by such act;
(e) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary to
carry out the purpose of such act;
(f) Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the
-8-
LB326 LB326
2025 2025
purpose of such act; and
(g) Bring any action against any third-party administrator, agent,
attorney, or other representative of the insolvent insurer to obtain custody
and control of all files, records, and electronic data related to an insolvent
insurer that is appropriate or necessary for the association, or a similar
organization in another state, to carry out duties under such act.
Sec. 13. Section 44-2411, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
44-2411 (1) Any person having a claim against any insurer under any
provisions of any insurance policy, which claim is also a covered claim against
an insolvent insurer under the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance
Guaranty Association Act, shall be required to exhaust all rights under such
policy before the association is obligated to pay the covered claim, whether
the claim is a first-party or third-party claim, including, but not limited to,
accident and health insurance, workers' compensation, and all other coverages
except policies of an insolvent insurer. Any person having a claim against any
state or federal government program, which claim would also give rise to a
covered claim, shall be required to exhaust all rights under such government
program before the association is obligated to pay the covered claim under such
act. Any amount payable on a covered claim by the provisions of such act shall
be reduced by the amount of the such recovery under any other insurance policy
or state or federal government program.
(2) Any person having a claim which may be recovered under more than one
insurance guaranty association, or its equivalent, shall seek recovery first
from the association of the place of residence of the insured, except that if
it is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location,
from the association of the location of the property, and if it is a workers'
compensation claim, from the association of the residence of the claimant. Any
recovery pursuant to the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty
Association Act shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery from any other
insurance guaranty association or its equivalent.
Sec. 14. Section 44-6135, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
44-6135 A mutual insurance holding company shall file with the director,
by March 1 of each year, an annual statement consisting of an income statement,
balance sheet, and cash flows prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting practices or statutory accounting principles and a confidential
statement disclosing any intention to pledge, borrow against, alienate,
hypothecate, or in any way encumber the assets of the mutual insurance holding
company. A mutual insurance holding company shall also have an annual audit by
an independent certified public accountant in a form approved by the director
and shall file such audit on or before June 1 of each year for the year ending
December 31 immediately preceding.
Sec. 15. Original sections 44-1523, 44-1524, 44-1525, 44-1527, 44-1528,
44-1529, 44-1530, 44-1532, 44-2403, 44-2405, 44-2406, 44-2407, 44-2411, and
44-6135, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, are repealed.

examinations under sections 44-2412 and 44-2413, and (iv) other expenses

the calendar year preceding the date of the assessment. The association may
make an assessment for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other
general expenses not related to a particular impaired insurer, not to exceed
fifty dollars per member insurer in any one year. Each member insurer shall be

jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact business as
an insurer. Deferred assessments shall be paid when such payment will not
reduce capital or surplus below such required minimum amounts. Such deferred
assessments, when paid, shall be refunded to those member insurers that

of any such insurer, credited against future assessments. No member insurer may
pay a dividend to shareholders or policyholders while such insurer has an
unpaid deferred assessment;

other persons designated by the association as a servicing facility, except

paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling
claims on behalf of the association and such other expenses of the association
as are authorized by the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty

certificate of contribution in appropriate form and terms as prescribed by the
director for the amount so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal

insurer may offset against its premium and related retaliatory tax liability to
this state, pursuant to sections 44-150 and 77-908, accrued with respect to
business transacted in such year, an amount equal to twenty percent of the
original face amount of the certificate of contribution, beginning with the
first calendar year after the year of issuance through the fifth calendar year
after the year of issuance. If the association recovers any sum representing
amounts previously written off by member insurers and offset against premium
and related retaliatory taxes imposed by sections 44-150 and 77-908, such
recovered sum shall be paid by the association to the director who shall handle
such funds in the same manner as provided in Chapter 77, article 9;

obligation for covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties,
and obligations of the insolvent insurer, subject to the limitations provided

the liquidator shall retain the sole right to recover any reinsurance proceeds.
The association's rights under this section include, but are not limited to,
the right to pursue and retain salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid
covered claim obligations to the extent paid by the guaranty fund; and
(f) Have access to impaired or insolvent insurer records. The
rehabilitator or liquidator of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall permit
access by the association or its authorized representatives, and by any similar
organization in another state or its authorized representatives, to the
impaired or insolvent insurer's records which are necessary for the association
or such similar organization in carrying out its functions with regard to
covered claims. In addition, the rehabilitator or liquidator shall provide the
association or its representative or such similar organization with copies of
such records upon the request and at the expense of the association or similar
organization. In providing the information set forth in this subdivision, the
association or its authorized representatives and the rehabilitator or
liquidator of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall execute such agreements as
are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the information provided; and
(g) Have the right to review and contest settlements, releases,
compromises, waivers, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its
insureds were parties prior to the entry of the order of liquidation. In an
action to enforce settlements, releases, and judgments to which the insolvent
insurer or its insureds were parties prior to the entry of the order of
liquidation, the association shall have the right to assert the following
defenses described in subsections (2) through (5) of this section, in addition
to the defenses available to the insurer.
(2) The association is not bound by a settlement, release, compromise, or
waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment entered against
an insured or the insurer by consent or through failure to exhaust all appeals,
if the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment was (a) executed,
or entered into, within one hundred twenty days prior to the entry of an order
of liquidation, and the insured or the insurer did not use reasonable care when
it entered into the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment, or
did not pursue all reasonable appeals of an adverse judgment or (b) executed by
or taken against an insured or the insurer based on default, fraud, collusion,
or the insurer's failure to defend.
(3) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the association is not
bound by a settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment for the reason
described in subdivision (2)(a) or (b) of this section, the settlement,
release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall be set aside, and the
association shall be permitted to defend any covered claim on the merits. The
settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall not be considered as
evidence of liability or damages in connection with any claim brought against
the association or any other party.
(4) The association shall have the right to assert any statutory defenses
or rights of offset against any settlement, release, compromise, or waiver
executed by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment taken against the
insured or the insurer.
(5) As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision,
verdict, or finding based on default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to
defend, the association, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the insured,
may apply to have the judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding set aside
by the same court or administrator that entered the judgment, order, decision,
verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend the claim on the merits.
(6) (2) The association may:
(a) Appear in, defend, and appeal any action;
(b) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims,
provide covered policy benefits and services, and appoint and direct other
service providers for covered services and perform other duties of the
association;
(c) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of the Nebraska Property
and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act in accord with the plan of
operation;
(d) Sue or be sued, and such power to sue shall include the power and
right to intervene as a party before any court that has jurisdiction over an
insolvent insurer as defined by such act;
(e) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary to
carry out the purpose of such act;
(f) Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the

purpose of such act; and
(g) Bring any action against any third-party administrator, agent,
attorney, or other representative of the insolvent insurer to obtain custody
and control of all files, records, and electronic data related to an insolvent
insurer that is appropriate or necessary for the association, or a similar
organization in another state, to carry out duties under such act.
Sec. 13. Section 44-2411, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
44-2411 (1) Any person having a claim against any insurer under any
provisions of any insurance policy, which claim is also a covered claim against
an insolvent insurer under the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance
Guaranty Association Act, shall be required to exhaust all rights under such
policy before the association is obligated to pay the covered claim, whether
the claim is a first-party or third-party claim, including, but not limited to,
accident and health insurance, workers' compensation, and all other coverages
except policies of an insolvent insurer. Any person having a claim against any
state or federal government program, which claim would also give rise to a
covered claim, shall be required to exhaust all rights under such government
program before the association is obligated to pay the covered claim under such
act. Any amount payable on a covered claim by the provisions of such act shall
be reduced by the amount of the such recovery under any other insurance policy
or state or federal government program.
(2) Any person having a claim which may be recovered under more than one
insurance guaranty association, or its equivalent, shall seek recovery first
from the association of the place of residence of the insured, except that if
it is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location,
from the association of the location of the property, and if it is a workers'
compensation claim, from the association of the residence of the claimant. Any
recovery pursuant to the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty
Association Act shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery from any other
insurance guaranty association or its equivalent.
Sec. 14. Section 44-6135, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
44-6135 A mutual insurance holding company shall file with the director,
by March 1 of each year, an annual statement consisting of an income statement,
balance sheet, and cash flows prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting practices or statutory accounting principles and a confidential
statement disclosing any intention to pledge, borrow against, alienate,
hypothecate, or in any way encumber the assets of the mutual insurance holding
company. A mutual insurance holding company shall also have an annual audit by
an independent certified public accountant in a form approved by the director
and shall file such audit on or before June 1 of each year for the year ending
December 31 immediately preceding.
Sec. 15. Original sections 44-1523, 44-1524, 44-1525, 44-1527, 44-1528,
44-1529, 44-1530, 44-1532, 44-2403, 44-2405, 44-2406, 44-2407, 44-2411, and
44-6135, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, are repealed.
