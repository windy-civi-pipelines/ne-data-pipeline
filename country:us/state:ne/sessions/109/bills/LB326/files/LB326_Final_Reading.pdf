4 Nebraska Insurers Supervision, Rehabilitation, and Liquidation Act, and
5 the association shall process such claim in the manner specified in
6 subsections (2) and (3) of this section. The filing of such claim shall
7 constitute an unconditional general release of all liability of such
8 insured in connection with the claim unless the association thereafter

10 insolvent insurer does not afford coverage or unless the claimant, within
11 thirty days from the date of filing a his or her claim with the director,
12 files with the director a written demand that the claim be processed in
13 the liquidation proceedings as a claim not covered by the Nebraska
14 Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act.
15 Sec. 12. Section 44-2407, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 44-2407 (1) The association shall:
18 (a) Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three
19 accounts separately and assess member insurers separately for each
20 account in the amounts necessary to pay (i) the obligations of the
21 association under section 44-2406, (ii) the expenses of handling covered
22 claims, (iii) the cost of examinations under sections 44-2412 and
23 44-2413, and (iv) other expenses authorized by the Nebraska Property and
24 Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act. The assessments of each
25 member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written
26 premiums of such member insurer, on the basis of the insurance in the
27 account involved, bears to the net direct written premiums of all member
28 insurers for the same period and in the same account for the calendar
29 year preceding the date of the assessment. The association may make an
30 assessment for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other
31 general expenses not related to a particular impaired insurer, not to
-19-

LB326 LB326
2025 2025
1 exceed fifty dollars per member insurer in any one year. Each member
2 insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than thirty days
3 before it is due. Except for such administrative assessment, no member
4 insurer may be assessed in any year, on any account, an amount greater
5 than one percent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for
6 the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account. The
7 association may defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member
8 insurer if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial
9 statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum
10 required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the
11 member insurer is authorized to transact business as an insurer. Deferred
12 assessments shall be paid when such payment will not reduce capital or
13 surplus below such required minimum amounts. Such deferred assessments,
14 when paid, shall be refunded to those member insurers that received
15 larger assessments by virtue of such deferment or, in the discretion of
16 any such insurer, credited against future assessments. No member insurer
17 may pay a dividend to shareholders or policyholders while such insurer
18 has an unpaid deferred assessment;
19 (b) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more
20 insurers or other persons designated by the association as a servicing
21 facility, except that the designation of a servicing facility shall be
22 subject to the approval of the director and such designation may be
23 declined by a member insurer;
24 (c) Reimburse any servicing facility for obligations of the
25 association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the
26 facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and such
27 other expenses of the association as are authorized by the Nebraska
28 Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act;
29 (d) Issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this section, a
30 certificate of contribution in appropriate form and terms as prescribed
31 by the director for the amount so paid. All outstanding certificates
-20-

LB326 LB326
2025 2025
1 shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or
2 dates of issue. The insurer may offset against its premium and related
3 retaliatory tax liability to this state, pursuant to sections 44-150 and
4 77-908, accrued with respect to business transacted in such year, an
5 amount equal to twenty percent of the original face amount of the
6 certificate of contribution, beginning with the first calendar year after
7 the year of issuance through the fifth calendar year after the year of
8 issuance. If the association recovers any sum representing amounts
9 previously written off by member insurers and offset against premium and
10 related retaliatory taxes imposed by sections 44-150 and 77-908, such
11 recovered sum shall be paid by the association to the director who shall
12 handle such funds in the same manner as provided in Chapter 77, article
13 9;
14 (e) Be deemed the insolvent insurer to the extent of the
15 association's obligation for covered claims and to such extent shall have
16 all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer, subject to
17 the limitations provided in the act, as if the insurer had not become
18 insolvent, with the exception that the liquidator shall retain the sole
19 right to recover any reinsurance proceeds. The association's rights under
20 this section include, but are not limited to, the right to pursue and
21 retain salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid covered claim
22 obligations to the extent paid by the guaranty fund; and
23 (f) Have access to impaired or insolvent insurer records. The
24 rehabilitator or liquidator of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall
25 permit access by the association or its authorized representatives, and
26 by any similar organization in another state or its authorized
27 representatives, to the impaired or insolvent insurer's records which are
28 necessary for the association or such similar organization in carrying
29 out its functions with regard to covered claims. In addition, the
30 rehabilitator or liquidator shall provide the association or its
31 representative or such similar organization with copies of such records
-21-

LB326 LB326
2025 2025
1 upon the request and at the expense of the association or similar
2 organization. In providing the information set forth in this subdivision,
3 the association or its authorized representatives and the rehabilitator
4 or liquidator of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall execute such
5 agreements as are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the
6 information provided; and
7 (g) Have the right to review and contest settlements, releases,
8 compromises, waivers, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its
9 insureds were parties prior to the entry of the order of liquidation. In
10 an action to enforce settlements, releases, and judgments to which the
11 insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties prior to the entry of the
12 order of liquidation, the association shall have the right to assert the
13 following defenses described in subsections (2) through (5) of this
14 section, in addition to the defenses available to the insurer.
15 (2) The association is not bound by a settlement, release,
16 compromise, or waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or any
17 judgment entered against an insured or the insurer by consent or through
18 failure to exhaust all appeals, if the settlement, release, compromise,
19 waiver, or judgment was (a) executed, or entered into, within one hundred
20 twenty days prior to the entry of an order of liquidation, and the
21 insured or the insurer did not use reasonable care when it entered into
22 the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment, or did not
23 pursue all reasonable appeals of an adverse judgment or (b) executed by
24 or taken against an insured or the insurer based on default, fraud,
25 collusion, or the insurer's failure to defend.
26 (3) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the association
27 is not bound by a settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment
28 for the reason described in subdivision (2)(a) or (b) of this section,
29 the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall be set
30 aside, and the association shall be permitted to defend any covered claim
31 on the merits. The settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment
-22-

LB326 LB326
2025 2025
1 shall not be considered as evidence of liability or damages in connection
2 with any claim brought against the association or any other party.
3 (4) The association shall have the right to assert any statutory
4 defenses or rights of offset against any settlement, release, compromise,
5 or waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment taken
6 against the insured or the insurer.
7 (5) As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any
8 decision, verdict, or finding based on default of the insolvent insurer
9 or its failure to defend, the association, either on its own behalf or on
10 behalf of the insured, may apply to have the judgment, order, decision,
11 verdict, or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that
12 entered the judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding and shall be
13 permitted to defend the claim on the merits.
14 (6) (2) The association may:
15 (a) Appear in, defend, and appeal any action;
16 (b) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims,
17 provide covered policy benefits and services, and appoint and direct
18 other service providers for covered services and perform other duties of
19 the association;
20 (c) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of the Nebraska
21 Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act in accord with
22 the plan of operation;
23 (d) Sue or be sued, and such power to sue shall include the power
24 and right to intervene as a party before any court that has jurisdiction
25 over an insolvent insurer as defined by such act;
26 (e) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary
27 to carry out the purpose of such act;
28 (f) Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate
29 the purpose of such act; and
30 (g) Bring any action against any third-party administrator, agent,
31 attorney, or other representative of the insolvent insurer to obtain
-23-

LB326 LB326
2025 2025

4 duties under such act.
5 Sec. 13. Section 44-2411, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
6 amended to read:

8 provisions of any insurance policy, which claim is also a covered claim
9 against an insolvent insurer under the Nebraska Property and Liability
10 Insurance Guaranty Association Act, shall be required to exhaust all
11 rights under such policy before the association is obligated to pay the
12 covered claim, whether the claim is a first-party or third-party claim,
13 including, but not limited to, accident and health insurance, workers'
14 compensation, and all other coverages except policies of an insolvent
15 insurer. Any person having a claim against any state or federal
16 government program, which claim would also give rise to a covered claim,
17 shall be required to exhaust all rights under such government program
18 before the association is obligated to pay the covered claim under such
19 act. Any amount payable on a covered claim by the provisions of such act
20 shall be reduced by the amount of the such recovery under any other
21 insurance policy or state or federal government program.
22 (2) Any person having a claim which may be recovered under more than
23 one insurance guaranty association, or its equivalent, shall seek
24 recovery first from the association of the place of residence of the
25 insured, except that if it is a first-party claim for damage to property
26 with a permanent location, from the association of the location of the
27 property, and if it is a workers' compensation claim, from the
28 association of the residence of the claimant. Any recovery pursuant to
29 the Nebraska Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act
30 shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery from any other insurance
31 guaranty association or its equivalent.
