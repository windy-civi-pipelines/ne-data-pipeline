2025 2025

22 the application to determine the population in the area included in the
23 exchange under this section.
24 (d) If the commission deregulates an exchange under this section and
25 the deregulation results in a regulated carrier no longer regulated or a
26 transitioning carrier no longer meeting the definition of a transitioning

14 Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act shall control.
15 (4) Nothing in this section affects the continuing applicability of
16 subsection (3) of section 86-123 and section 86-124.
17 (5) The commission may hear complaints filed by any retail or
18 wholesale customers against a deregulated carrier that are in the scope
19 of the commission's authority provided under this section.
20 Sec. 8. Except as provided by section 9 of this act, a
21 transitioning carrier is governed by the Telecommunications Exchange
22 Deregulation Act and the provisions of Chapters 75 and 86 that applied to
23 the carrier immediately before the date the carrier was classified as a
24 transitioning carrier. If there is a conflict between the
25 Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and other applicable
26 provisions of Chapters 75 and 86, the Telecommunications Exchange
27 Deregulation Act shall control.

29 following in the deregulated exchange:
30 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;

9 deregulated exchanges.
10 Sec. 10. In an exchange that remains regulated, a transitioning

15 Act shall relieve a telecommunications or communications provider from
16 requirements in section 86-124.
17 Sec. 12. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
18 service in a deregulated exchange shall be exempt from subsection (1)(a)
19 of section 86-134. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
20 service in a deregulated exchange shall be solely subject to subsection
21 (1)(b) of section 86-134.
22 Sec. 13. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and
23 regulations and conduct any proceedings necessary to administer and
24 enforce the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act, including rules
25 and regulations to determine whether an exchange should remain regulated,
26 be deregulated, or be reregulated.
27 Sec. 14. Original section 86-124, Reissue Revised Statutes of

11 than one hundred thousand inhabitants and, in addition to the electing
12 local exchange carrier, there are at least two other carriers providing
13 voice communications service in all of the exchange.
14 (b) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section,
15 the commission may determine that an exchange should be deregulated if,
16 in addition to the electing local exchange carrier, at least two other
17 carriers are providing voice communications service in at least seventy-
18 five percent of the square miles in the exchange.
19 (c) The commission shall use federal census data from the most
20 recent federal decennial census or the most recent revised certified
21 count by the United States Bureau of the Census available at the time of
22 the application to determine the population in the area included in the
23 exchange under this section.
24 (d) If the commission deregulates an exchange under this section and
25 the deregulation results in a regulated carrier no longer regulated or a
26 transitioning carrier no longer meeting the definition of a transitioning
27 carrier, the commission shall issue an order reclassifying such carrier
28 as a deregulated carrier.
29 Sec. 7. (1) A deregulated carrier is not required to:
30 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
31 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to

1 quality of service;
2 (c) Comply with restrictions on rates for telecommunications
3 services, including advanced telecommunications services, unless the
4 restrictions are a condition of receiving grant funds administered by the
5 commission or imposed for compliance with sections 86-139 to 86-157; or
6 (d) File an earnings report with the commission.
7 (2) The commission shall not provide a deregulated carrier with any
8 funds from the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund.
9 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapters 75 and 86, the
10 commission shall have only the authority over a deregulated carrier
11 provided under the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act. If there
12 is a conflict between the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act
13 and the other applicable provisions of Chapter 75 and 86, the
14 Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act shall control.
15 (4) Nothing in this section affects the continuing applicability of
16 subsection (3) of section 86-123 and section 86-124.
17 (5) The commission may hear complaints filed by any retail or
18 wholesale customers against a deregulated carrier that are in the scope
19 of the commission's authority provided under this section.
20 Sec. 8. Except as provided by section 9 of this act, a
21 transitioning carrier is governed by the Telecommunications Exchange
22 Deregulation Act and the provisions of Chapters 75 and 86 that applied to
23 the carrier immediately before the date the carrier was classified as a
24 transitioning carrier. If there is a conflict between the
25 Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act and other applicable
26 provisions of Chapters 75 and 86, the Telecommunications Exchange
27 Deregulation Act shall control.
28 Sec. 9. (1) A transitioning carrier is no longer required to do the
29 following in the deregulated exchange:
30 (a) Fulfill the obligations of a carrier of last resort;
31 (b) Comply with standards or reporting requirements related to
-7-

LB4 LB4
2025 2025
1 quality of service; or
2 (c) Comply with a pricing requirement unless the requirement is a
3 condition of receiving grant funds administered by the commission.
4 (2) A transitioning carrier is not eligible to receive funds from
5 the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund for deregulated
6 exchanges and the commission shall, to the extent feasible in the funding
7 formula, reduce a transitioning carrier's allocation of funds from the
8 Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service Fund to account for
9 deregulated exchanges.
10 Sec. 10. In an exchange that remains regulated, a transitioning
11 carrier shall price the carrier's retail services in accordance with the
12 provisions that applied to that carrier immediately before the date the
13 carrier was classified by the commission as a transitioning carrier.
14 Sec. 11. Nothing in the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation
15 Act shall relieve a telecommunications or communications provider from
16 requirements in section 86-124.
17 Sec. 12. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
18 service in a deregulated exchange shall be exempt from subsection (1)(a)
19 of section 86-134. A telecommunications company seeking to discontinue
20 service in a deregulated exchange shall be solely subject to subsection
21 (1)(b) of section 86-134.
22 Sec. 13. The commission may adopt and promulgate rules and
23 regulations and conduct any proceedings necessary to administer and
24 enforce the Telecommunications Exchange Deregulation Act, including rules
25 and regulations to determine whether an exchange should remain regulated,
26 be deregulated, or be reregulated.
27 Sec. 14. Original section 86-124, Reissue Revised Statutes of
28 Nebraska, and section 75-109.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
29 2024, are repealed.
