Introduced by Dorn, 30; Hughes, 24.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the financing of public education through the Tax Equity and
Educational Opportunities Support Act formula and develop recommendations for
improving school funding in Nebraska. The study may review ways to increase the

property taxes as a share of total state and local taxes.
This study shall include, but not be limited to, examining:
(1) Fairness and equity for public school students in all parts of the
state;
(2) Efficiencies and effectiveness in the use of tax resources to educate
public school students in Nebraska; and
(3) Stability in the resources available to school districts, particularly
in times of economic volatility.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Education Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
