1 Section 1. Section 79-902, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

4 the context otherwise requires:
5 (1) Accumulated contributions means the sum of all amounts deducted

8 thereon, compounded monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually;
9 (2)(a) Actuarial equivalent means the equality in value of the
10 aggregate amounts expected to be received under different forms of
11 payment.
12 (b) For a school employee hired before July 1, 2017, the
13 determinations shall be based on the 1994 Group Annuity Mortality Table
14 reflecting sex-distinct factors blended using twenty-five percent of the
15 male table and seventy-five percent of the female table. An interest rate
16 of eight percent per annum shall be reflected in making these
17 determinations except when a lump-sum settlement is made to an estate.
18 (c) For a school employee hired on or after July 1, 2017, or rehired
19 on or after July 1, 2017, after termination of employment and being paid
20 a retirement benefit or taking a refund of contributions, the
21 determinations shall be based on a unisex mortality table and an interest
22 rate specified by the board. Both the mortality table and the interest
23 rate shall be recommended by the actuary and approved by the retirement
24 board following an actuarial experience study, a benefit adequacy study,
25 or a plan valuation. The mortality table, interest rate, and actuarial
26 factors in effect on the school employee's retirement date will be used
27 to calculate actuarial equivalency of any retirement benefit. Such
28 interest rate may be, but is not required to be, equal to the assumed
29 rate.
30 (d) If the lump-sum settlement is made to an estate, the interest
31 rate will be determined by the AAA-rated segment of the Bloomberg
