6 this section multiplied by the ratio of the school district taxes levied
7 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
8 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
9 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year
10 thereafter, the Property Tax Administrator shall determine the amount to
11 be disbursed under this subsection to each county and shall certify such
12 amounts to the State Treasurer and to each county. The disbursements to
13 the counties shall occur in two equal payments, the first on or before
14 January 31 and the second on or before April 1.
15 (5) The county treasurer shall disburse amounts received under
16 subsection (4) of this section, which are credited against the amount of
17 property taxes owed to school districts, in the same manner as if such
18 funds had been received in the form of property tax payments for property
19 taxes owed to school districts, meaning any amounts attributable to
20 divided taxes pursuant to section 18-2147 of the Community Development
21 Law shall be remitted to the applicable authority for which such taxes
22 were divided.

24 used for purposes of making the disbursements to counties required under
25 subsection (4) of this section.
26 Sec. 4. Original sections 77-4602, 77-7304, and 77-7305, Revised
