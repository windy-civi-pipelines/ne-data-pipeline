13 acceptance and rejection of applications for enrollment as an option
14 student.

16 school district shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. If an
17 application for option enrollment received by a school district indicates
18 that the student has an individualized education program under the
19 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et
20 seq., or has been diagnosed with a disability as defined in section
21 79-1118.01, such application shall be evaluated by the director of

24 class, grade level, or school building in such school district has the
25 capacity to provide the applicant the appropriate services and
26 accommodations.
27 (c) For all other students, standards may include the capacity of a
28 program, class, grade level, or school building. Capacity shall be
29 determined by setting a maximum number of option students that a district

31 upon available staff, facilities, projected enrollment of resident
-7-

LB557 LB557

2 district will contract based on existing contractual arrangements.
3 (2) Standards shall only include a random selection process and the
4 interest of the student and parent or legal guardian. (d) To facilitate
5 option enrollment, school districts shall annually establish, publish,
6 and report the capacity for each school building under such district's
7 control pursuant to procedures, criteria, and deadlines established by
8 the State Board of Education. Except as otherwise provided in this
9 section, a school board may by resolution, prior to October 15 of each

19 information submitted by a parent or guardian on an application to an
20 option school district may be cause for the option school district to
21 reject a previously accepted application if the rejection occurs prior to
22 the student's attendance as an option student.
23 (2) The school board of every school district shall also adopt
24 specific standards and conditions for acceptance or rejection of a
25 request for release of a resident or option student submitting an
26 application to an option school district after March 15 under subsection
27 (1) of section 79-237. Standards shall not include that a request
28 occurred after the deadline set forth in this subsection.
29 (3) Any option school district that is not a member of a learning
30 community shall give first priority for enrollment to siblings of option
31 students, except that the option school district shall not be required to
-8-

LB557 LB557
2025 2025
1 accept the sibling of an option student if the district is at capacity
2 except as provided in subsection (1) of section 79-240.
3 (4) Any option school district that is in a learning community shall
4 give first priority for enrollment to siblings of option students
5 enrolled in the option school district, second priority for enrollment to
6 students who have previously been enrolled in the option school district
7 as an open enrollment student, third priority for enrollment to students
8 who reside in the learning community and who contribute to the
9 socioeconomic diversity of enrollment at the school building to which the
10 student will be assigned pursuant to section 79-235, and final priority
11 for enrollment to other students who reside in the learning community.
12 The option school district shall not be required to accept a student
13 meeting the priority criteria in this section if the district is at
14 capacity as determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this section except
15 as provided in section 79-235.01 or 79-240. For purposes of the
16 enrollment option program, a student who contributes to the socioeconomic
17 diversity of enrollment at a school building within a learning community
18 means (a) a student who does not qualify for free or reduced-price
19 lunches when, based upon the certification pursuant to section 79-2120,
20 the school building the student will be assigned to attend either has
21 more students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches than the
22 average percentage of such students in all school buildings in the
23 learning community or provides free meals to all students pursuant to the
24 community eligibility provision or (b) a student who qualifies for free
25 or reduced-price lunches based on information collected voluntarily from
26 parents and guardians pursuant to section 79-237 when, based upon the
27 certification pursuant to section 79-2120, the school building the
28 student will be assigned to attend has fewer students qualifying for free
29 or reduced-price lunches than the average percentage of such students in
30 all school buildings in the learning community and does not provide free
31 meals to all students pursuant to the community eligibility provision.

2025 2025
1 (b) For purposes of this subsection, student who contributes to the
2 socioeconomic diversity of enrollment at the school building he or she

6 (c) For any student who resides within a learning community and
7 transfers to another school building pursuant to the open enrollment
8 provisions of section 79-2110 and who had not been accepted for open
9 enrollment into any school building within such school district prior to
10 September 6, 2013, the school board is exempt from the requirement of
11 subdivision (2)(a) of this section if (i) the student is transferring to
12 another school building within his or her home school district or (ii)

17 transportation pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall
18 equal two hundred eighty-five percent of the mileage rate provided in
19 section 81-1176, multiplied by each mile actually and necessarily
20 traveled, on each day of attendance, beyond which the one-way distance
21 from the residence of the student to the school exceeds three miles. Such
22 transportation allowance does not apply to students residing in a
23 learning community who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.
24 (3) (4) Whenever students from more than one family travel to school
25 in the same vehicle, the transportation allowance prescribed in
26 subsection (2) (3) of this section shall be payable as follows:

2 of the amount determined pursuant to subsection (2) (3) of this section;
3 and
4 (b) To the parent, custodial parent, or guardian not providing
5 transportation for students of other families, two hundred eighty-five

8 from the residence of the student to the pick-up point at which students
9 transfer to the vehicle of a parent, custodial parent, or guardian
10 described in subdivision (a) of this subsection.
11 (4) (5) When a student who qualifies under the mileage requirements
12 of subsection (1) of this section lives more than three miles from the
13 location where the student must be picked up and dropped off in order to
14 access school-provided free transportation, as measured by the shortest
15 route that must actually and necessarily be traveled by motor vehicle
16 between his or her residence and such location, such school-provided
17 transportation shall be deemed partially provided free transportation.
18 School districts partially providing free transportation shall pay an
19 allowance to the student's parent or guardian equal to two hundred
20 eighty-five percent of the mileage rate provided in section 81-1176
21 multiplied by each mile actually and necessarily traveled, on each day of
22 attendance, beyond which the one-way distance from the residence of the
23 student to the location where the student must be picked up and dropped
24 off exceeds three miles.
25 (5) (6) The board may authorize school-provided transportation to
26 any student who does not qualify under the mileage requirements of
27 subsection (1) of this section and may charge a fee to the parent or
28 guardian of the student for such service. No transportation payments
29 shall be made to a family for mileage not actually traveled by such
30 family. The number of days the student has attended school shall be
31 reported monthly by the teacher to the board of such public school

15 included in pathways across member school districts pursuant to the
16 diversity plan developed by the learning community coordinating council

19 program, focus school, or magnet school, the school districts shall form
20 a joint entity pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act for the purpose
21 of creating, implementing, and operating such focus program, focus
22 school, or magnet school. The agreement creating such joint entity shall
