machine usage fee. Such agreement shall be implied by the use of such automatic
teller machines.

or (v) the automatic teller machines established or sponsored by an
establishing financial institution are made available for use by Nebraska
customers of any user financial institution which agrees to pay the automatic

appear on the screen of the automatic teller machine or appear on a paper
notice issued from such machine after the transaction is initiated and before
the consumer is irrevocably committed to completing the transaction.
(5) A point-of-sale terminal may be established at any point within this
state by a financial institution, a group of two or more financial
institutions, or a combination of a financial institution or financial
institutions and a third party or parties. Such parties may contract with a
seller of goods and services or any other third party for the operation of
point-of-sale terminals.
(6) A seller of goods and services or any other third party on whose

terminal on its premises.

or foreign financial institutions or to allow customers of out-of-state
financial institutions or foreign financial institutions to use its automatic
teller machines. Such participation and any automatic teller machine usage fees
charged or received pursuant to the national automatic teller machine program
or usage fees charged for the use of its automatic teller machines by customers
of out-of-state financial institutions or foreign financial institutions shall
not be considered for purposes of determining (a) if an automatic teller
machine has been made available or Nebraska automatic teller machine
transactions have been made on a nondiscriminating basis for use by Nebraska
customers of a user financial institution or (b) if a switch complies with
subdivision (3)(d) of this section.
(11) An agreement to operate or share an automatic teller machine may not
prohibit, limit, or restrict the right of the operator or owner of the
automatic teller machine to charge a customer conducting a transaction using an
account from a foreign financial institution an access fee or surcharge not
otherwise prohibited under state or federal law.
(12) Switch fees shall not be subject to this section or be regulated by
the department.
(13) Nothing in this section shall prevent a group of two or more credit
unions, each of which has a main chartered office or an approved branch located
in the State of Nebraska, from participating in a credit union service
organization organized on or before January 1, 2015, for the purpose of owning
automatic teller machines, provided that all participating credit unions have
an ownership interest in the credit union service organization and that the
credit union service organization has an ownership interest in each of the
participating credit unions' automatic teller machines. Such participation and
any automatic teller machine usage fees associated with Nebraska automatic

unions at such automatic teller machines shall not be considered for purposes
of determining if such automatic teller machines have been made available on a
nondiscriminating basis or if Nebraska automatic teller machine transactions
initiated at such automatic teller machines have been made on a
nondiscriminating basis, provided that all Nebraska automatic teller machine
transactions initiated by customers of participating credit unions result in
the same automatic teller machine usage fees for essentially the same service
routed over the same switch.

Corporation Act;

employee benefits arrangement does not present a risk to the safety and
soundness of the domestic credit union as determined by the director, the
purchase of those investment products is not subject to the limitations of the
Credit Union Act.
(2) In addition to investments expressly permitted by the Credit Union
Act, a credit union may make any other type of investment approved by the
department by rule, regulation, or order.

Act or any other Nebraska statute, any credit union incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nebraska and organized under the provisions of the act shall
have all the rights, powers, privileges, benefits, and immunities which may be
exercised as of January 1, 2025 2024, by a federal credit union doing business
in Nebraska on the condition that such rights, powers, privileges, benefits,
and immunities shall not relieve such credit union from payment of state taxes
assessed under any applicable laws of this state.
Sec. 26. Section 44-708, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is amended
to read:
44-708 (1) Insurers authorized to deliver or issue for delivery life
insurance policies in this state may deliver or issue for delivery one or more
funding agreements, but the delivery or issuance for delivery of funding
agreements shall not be deemed the business of insurance, life insurance or an
annuity or other line of business as set forth in section 44-201, a security as
defined in subdivision (14) (15) of section 8-1101, or receipt of gross
premiums as set forth in section 77-908. The delivery or issuance for delivery
of a funding agreement by an admitted life insurer in this state shall
constitute a lawful activity of that insurer that is reasonably related to and
incidental to its insurance activities as provided in this section. However,
this section shall not authorize any insurer to transact, under the guise of
funding agreements, any line of insurance not authorized by its certificate of
authority.
(2) No amounts shall be guaranteed or credited under any funding agreement
except upon reasonable assumptions as to investment income and expenses and on
a basis equitable to all holders of funding agreements of a given class.

of settlement, under funding agreements may be allocated by the insurer to one
or more separate accounts.
(4) The Director of Insurance may adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations to implement this section, including rules and regulations setting
forth the terms and conditions under which an insurer may issue funding
agreements.
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the director shall have
sole authority to regulate the issuance and sale of funding agreements,
including the persons selling funding agreements on behalf of insurers.
(6) Nothing in this section is intended to affect the order in which
allowed claims shall be given preference under section 44-4842. Holders of
funding agreements shall retain the priority in allowance of claims described
in subdivision (2) of section 44-4842.
(7) For purposes of this section, funding agreement means an agreement
that authorizes an admitted life insurer to accept funds and that provides for
an accumulation of those funds for the purpose of making one or more payments
at future dates in amounts that are not based on mortality or morbidity
contingencies. Funding agreement does not include any agreement in connection
with the funding of one or more payments that are excludable from the gross
income of the recipient under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Sec. 27. Section 45-101.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

lawful to contract for and receive any rate of interest on such transaction as
the parties thereto may expressly agree;
(7) Interest charges made on open credit accounts by a person who sells
goods or services on credit when the interest charges do not exceed one and
one-third percent per month for any charges which remain unpaid for more than
thirty days following rendition of the statement of account;

hearing. If the director determines that the condition of the credit union does
not warrant a hearing, the director shall notify the applicant credit union of

to read:
44-708 (1) Insurers authorized to deliver or issue for delivery life

agreements shall not be deemed the business of insurance, life insurance or an
annuity or other line of business as set forth in section 44-201, a security as
defined in subdivision (14) (15) of section 8-1101, or receipt of gross
premiums as set forth in section 77-908. The delivery or issuance for delivery
of a funding agreement by an admitted life insurer in this state shall
constitute a lawful activity of that insurer that is reasonably related to and
incidental to its insurance activities as provided in this section. However,
this section shall not authorize any insurer to transact, under the guise of
funding agreements, any line of insurance not authorized by its certificate of

allowed claims shall be given preference under section 44-4842. Holders of
funding agreements shall retain the priority in allowance of claims described
in subdivision (2) of section 44-4842.
(7) For purposes of this section, funding agreement means an agreement
that authorizes an admitted life insurer to accept funds and that provides for
an accumulation of those funds for the purpose of making one or more payments
at future dates in amounts that are not based on mortality or morbidity
contingencies. Funding agreement does not include any agreement in connection
with the funding of one or more payments that are excludable from the gross
income of the recipient under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Sec. 27. Section 45-101.04, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is

lawful to contract for and receive any rate of interest on such transaction as
the parties thereto may expressly agree;

goods or services on credit when the interest charges do not exceed one and
one-third percent per month for any charges which remain unpaid for more than
thirty days following rendition of the statement of account;
