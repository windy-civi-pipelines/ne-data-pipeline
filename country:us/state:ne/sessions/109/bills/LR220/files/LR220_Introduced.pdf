FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 220
Introduced by Fredrickson, 20.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the adequacy of funding and resources available to Level 3 Special
Education Contractual Services for children. Children and students receiving
Level 3 care require the highest level of intervention and support due to the
severity of their behavioral or emotional challenges. Level 3 care providers
offer specialized and intensive care for children exhibiting significant
behavioral issues, such as aggression, self-harm, severe defiance, and
disruptions to their living environments. The effectiveness of Level 3 care is
directly influenced by staffing levels, access to therapeutic services,
facility safety and structure, and the implementation of innovative care models
tailored to the unique needs of residents. Additional resources may be
necessary to enhance staffing, expand therapeutic services, improve facility
infrastructure, and support program evaluation to better address the needs of
children in Level 3 care. Ensuring transparency and evaluating effectiveness of
such resources is critical to determining their impact and justifying future
needs.
This study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Assessing current funding levels and their utilization by Level 3 care
providers;
(2) Evaluating the adequacy of staffing levels, including staff-to-student
ratios and training programs for managing severe behavioral challenges;
(3) Analyzing the availability and quality of therapeutic services, such
as individualized and group counseling, trauma-informed care, and crisis
intervention strategies;
(4) Examining the state of facility infrastructure, including safety

features and therapeutic environments;
(5) Reviewing existing program development efforts and their outcomes; and
(6) Identifying potential funding gaps and recommending strategies to
ensure adequate support for these facilities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Health and Human Services Committee of the Legislature shall
be designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this
resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
