1 Section 1. Section 79-724, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
2 amended to read:
3 79-724 It is the responsibility of society to ensure that youth are
4 given the opportunity to become competent, responsible, patriotic, and
5 civil citizens to ensure a strong, stable, just, and prosperous America.
6 Such a citizenry necessitates that every member thereof be knowledgeable
7 of our nation's history, government, geography, and economic system. The
8 youth in our state should be committed to the ideals and values of our
9 country's democracy and the constitutional republic established by the
10 people. Schools should help prepare our youth to make informed and
11 reasoned decisions for the public good. Civic competence is necessary to
12 sustain and improve our democratic way of life and must be taught in all
13 public, private, denominational, and parochial schools. A central role of
14 schools is to impart civic knowledge and skills that help our youth to
15 see the relevance of a civic dimension for their lives. Students should
16 be made fully aware of the liberties, opportunities, and advantages we
17 possess and the sacrifices and struggles of those through whose efforts
18 these benefits were gained. Since young people are most susceptible to
19 the acceptance of principles and doctrines that will influence them
20 throughout their lives, it is one of the first duties of our educational
21 system to conduct its activities, choose its textbooks, and arrange its
22 curriculum in such a way that the youth of our state have the opportunity
23 to become competent, responsible, patriotic, and civil American citizens.
24 (1) The school board of each school district shall, at the beginning
25 of each calendar year, appoint from its members a committee of three, to
26 be known as the committee on American civics, which shall:
27 (a) Hold no fewer than two public meetings annually, at least one
28 when public testimony is accepted;
29 (b) Keep minutes of each meeting showing the time and place of the
30 meeting, which members were present or absent, and the substance and
31 details of all matters discussed;

1 (c) Examine and ensure that the social studies curriculum used in
2 the district is aligned with the social studies standards adopted
3 pursuant to section 79-760.01 and teaches foundational knowledge in
4 civics, history, economics, financial literacy, and geography;
5 (d) Review and approve the social studies curriculum to ensure that
6 it stresses the services of the men and women who played a crucial role
7 in the achievement of national independence, establishment of our
8 constitutional government, and preservation of the union and includes the
9 incorporation of multicultural education as set forth in sections 79-719
10 to 79-723 in order to instill a pride and respect for the nation's
11 institutions and not be merely a recital of events and dates;
12 (e) Ensure that any curriculum recommended or approved by the
13 committee on American civics is made readily accessible to the public and
14 contains a reference to this section;
15 (f) Ensure that the district develops and utilizes formative,
16 interim, and summative assessments to measure student mastery of the
17 social studies standards adopted pursuant to section 79-760.01;
18 (g) Ensure that the social studies curriculum in the district
19 incorporates one or more of the following for each student:
20 (i) Administration of a written test that is identical to the entire
21 civics portion of the naturalization test used by United States
22 Citizenship and Immigration Services prior to the completion of eighth
23 grade and again prior to the completion of twelfth grade with the

25 parent or guardian of such student; or
26 (ii) Attendance or participation between the commencement of eighth
27 grade and completion of twelfth grade in a meeting of a public body as
28 defined by section 84-1409 followed by the completion of a project or
