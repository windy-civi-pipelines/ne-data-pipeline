Introduced by Rountree, 3.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
identify and examine the ability of the State of Nebraska to draw down Title
IV-E funds for purposes of pre-petition legal services for parent and child
legal representation as permitted under federal law. This interim study shall
examine, but need not be limited to, the following:
(1) The benefits Nebraska families would receive if the State of Nebraska
could access Title IV-E funds for pre-petition legal services;
(2) The organizational structure needed within state government to
coordinate the receipt and disbursement of payments for pre-petition legal
services from Title IV-E funding; and
(3) Whether any statutory changes are necessary or useful in order to
allow the Department of Health and Human Services to serve as the conduit for
Title IV-E funding for pre-petition legal services.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.
