2 is amended to read:
3 71-502.03 (1) Every physician, or other person authorized by law to
4 practice obstetrics, who is attending a pregnant woman in the state for
5 conditions relating to her pregnancy during the period of gestation or at
6 delivery shall take or cause to be taken a sample of the blood of such
7 woman at the time of the first examination, third trimester examination,
8 and birth and shall submit such sample to an approved laboratory for a
9 standard serological test for syphilis. Every other person permitted by
10 law to attend pregnant women in the state, but not permitted by law to
11 take blood samples, shall cause such a sample of the blood of such
12 pregnant women to be taken by a physician, duly licensed to practice
13 either medicine and surgery or obstetrics, or other person authorized by
14 law to take such sample of blood and have such sample submitted to an
15 approved laboratory for a standard serological test for syphilis. The
16 results of all such laboratory tests shall be reported to the Department
17 of Health and Human Services on standard forms prescribed and furnished
18 by the department. For the purpose of this section, a standard
19 serological test shall be a test for syphilis approved by the department
20 and shall be made at a laboratory approved to make such tests by the
21 department. Such laboratory tests, as are required by this section, shall
22 be made on request at the Department of Health and Human Services
23 Laboratory. A fee may be established by rule and regulation by the
24 department to defray no more than the actual cost of such tests. Such fee
25 shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the Health and
26 Human Services Cash Fund. In reporting every birth and stillbirth,
27 physicians and others required to make such reports shall state on the
28 portion of the certificate entitled For Medical and Health Use Only

7 relating to her pregnancy during the period of gestation shall administer
8 or cause to be administered a test of the pregnant womanâ€™s blood for the
