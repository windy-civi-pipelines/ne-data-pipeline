3 25-21,185.11 (1) A release, covenant not to sue, or similar
4 agreement entered into by a claimant and a person liable shall discharge
5 that person from all liability to the claimant but shall not discharge

9 by the trier of fact.
10 (2) A release, covenant not to sue, or similar agreement entered
11 into by a claimant and a person liable shall preclude that person from
12 being made a party or, if an action is pending, shall be a basis for that
13 person's dismissal, but the person's negligence, if any, shall be
14 considered in accordance with section 25-21,185.09.
15 (3) A release, covenant not to sue, or similar agreement entered
16 into by a claimant and one or more persons liable shall not abrogate the
