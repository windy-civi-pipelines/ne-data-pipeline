1 Section 1. Section 77-202, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 77-202 (1) The following property shall be exempt from property
4 taxes:
5 (a) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions to the
6 extent used or being developed for use by the state or governmental
7 subdivision for a public purpose. For purposes of this subdivision:
8 (i) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions means
9 (A) property held in fee title by the state or a governmental subdivision
10 or (B) property beneficially owned by the state or a governmental
11 subdivision in that it is used for a public purpose and is being acquired
12 under a lease-purchase agreement, financing lease, or other instrument
13 which provides for transfer of legal title to the property to the state
14 or a governmental subdivision upon payment of all amounts due thereunder.
15 If the property to be beneficially owned by a governmental subdivision
16 has a total acquisition cost that exceeds the threshold amount or will be
17 used as the site of a public building with a total estimated construction
18 cost that exceeds the threshold amount, then such property shall qualify
19 for an exemption under this section only if the question of acquiring
20 such property or constructing such public building has been submitted at
21 a primary, general, or special election held within the governmental
22 subdivision and has been approved by the voters of the governmental
23 subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, threshold amount means the
24 greater of fifty thousand dollars or six-tenths of one percent of the
25 total actual value of real and personal property of the governmental
26 subdivision that will beneficially own the property as of the end of the
27 governmental subdivision's prior fiscal year; and
28 (ii) Public purpose means use of the property (A) to provide public
29 services with or without cost to the recipient, including the general
30 operation of government, public education, public safety, transportation,
31 public works, civil and criminal justice, public health and welfare,
-2-

1 developments by a public housing authority, parks, culture, recreation,
2 community development, and cemetery purposes, or (B) to carry out the
3 duties and responsibilities conferred by law with or without
4 consideration. Public purpose does not include leasing of property to a
5 private party unless the lease of the property is at fair market value
6 for a public purpose. Leases of property by a public housing authority to
7 low-income individuals as a place of residence are for the authority's
8 public purpose;
9 (b) Unleased property of the state or its governmental subdivisions
10 which is not being used or developed for use for a public purpose but
11 upon which a payment in lieu of taxes is paid for public safety, rescue,
12 and emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
13 services to all governmental units providing such services to the
14 property. Except as provided in Article VIII, section 11, of the
15 Constitution of Nebraska, the payment in lieu of taxes shall be based on
16 the proportionate share of the cost of providing public safety, rescue,
17 or emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
18 services unless a general policy is adopted by the governing body of the
19 governmental subdivision providing such services which provides for a
20 different method of determining the amount of the payment in lieu of
21 taxes. The governing body may adopt a general policy by ordinance or
22 resolution for determining the amount of payment in lieu of taxes by
23 majority vote after a hearing on the ordinance or resolution. Such
24 ordinance or resolution shall nevertheless result in an equitable
25 contribution for the cost of providing such services to the exempt
26 property;
27 (c) Property owned by and used exclusively for agricultural and
28 horticultural societies;
29 (d)(i) Property owned by educational, religious, charitable, or
30 cemetery organizations, or any organization for the exclusive benefit of
31 any such educational, religious, charitable, or cemetery organization,
-3-

2025 2025
1 and used exclusively for educational, religious, charitable, or cemetery
2 purposes, when such property is not (A) owned or used for financial gain
3 or profit to either the owner or user, (B) used for the sale of alcoholic
4 liquors for more than twenty hours per week, or (C) owned or used by an
5 organization which discriminates in membership or employment based on
6 race, color, or national origin.
7 (ii) For purposes of subdivision (1)(d) of this section:

12 guarantying of federally reinsured student loans for higher education,
13 (II) a museum or historical society operated exclusively for the benefit
14 and education of the public, or (III) a nonprofit organization that owns
15 or operates a child care facility; and
16 (B) Charitable organization includes (I) an organization operated
17 exclusively for the purpose of the mental, social, or physical benefit of
18 the public or an indefinite number of persons and (II) a fraternal
19 benefit society organized and licensed under sections 44-1072 to

25 section 71-5903 that provides housing for medicaid beneficiaries, except
26 that the exemption amount for such property shall be a percentage of the
27 property taxes that would otherwise be due. Such percentage shall be
28 equal to the average percentage of occupied beds in the facility provided
29 to medicaid beneficiaries over the most recent three-year period. This
30 subdivision shall not be construed to modify, limit, or reduce any
31 property tax exemption provided to a nonprofit skilled nursing facility,

28 property is of a type which in the ordinary course of business is leased
29 or rented thirty days or less and may be returned at the option of the
