LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 123
Introduced by Jacobson, 42.
examine the collection, use, and protection of agricultural data in Nebraska
with a focus on trade practices and consumer protection which is the focus of
the Agricultural Data Protection Act introduced as LB525 in the First Session
of the One Hundred Ninth Legislature. Agricultural data encompasses a wide
range of information, from crop yields and soil conditions to livestock health
and market trends, and is increasingly vital to the operation and profitability
of Nebraska farms and ranches. The proliferation of digital technologies and
data-driven practices in agriculture has led to a significant increase in the
collection and storage of sensitive agricultural data by various corporations
and entities. This has raised concerns regarding the potential for unauthorized
use, sale, and sharing of farmers' and ranchers' data, which may lead to unfair
trade practices and consumer protection issues.
The interim study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) The types of agricultural data being collected and utilized by
corporations and other entities;
(2) The existing legal and contractual frameworks governing the ownership,
use, and transfer of agricultural data;
(3) The potential for unfair trade practices and consumer protection
issues arising from the unauthorized use or sale of farmers' and ranchers'
data;
(4) Best practices for data protection and security in the agricultural
sector;
(5) The impact of data sharing and aggregation on market transparency and
competition; and
