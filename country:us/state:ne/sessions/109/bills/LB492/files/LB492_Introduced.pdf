LB492 LB492
2025 2025

28 the attendance officer believes that there is a violation of subsection
29 (2) of section 79-201, the attendance officer shall immediately
30 investigate such alleged violation.
31 (2) All school boards shall have a written policy on attendance
-9-

LB492 LB492
2025 2025
1 developed and annually reviewed in collaboration with the county attorney
2 of the county in which the principal office of the school district is
3 located. The policy shall include a provision indicating how the school
4 district will handle cases in which excessive absences are due to
5 illness. The policy shall also state the circumstances and number of
6 absences or the hourly equivalent upon which the school shall render all
7 services to address barriers to attendance. Such services shall be
8 provided prior to upon twenty days of absence, and shall include, but not
9 be limited to:
10 (a) Written communication by school officials with the person or
11 persons who have legal or actual charge or control of any child; and
12 (b) One or more meetings between, at a minimum, a school attendance
13 officer, a school social worker, or a school administrator or his or her
14 designee, the person who has legal or actual charge or control of the
15 child, the person who is responsible for making educational decisions on
16 behalf of the child if that person is someone other than the person who
17 has legal or actual charge or control of the child, and the child, when
18 appropriate, to address the barriers to attendance. The result of the
19 meeting or meetings shall be to develop a collaborative plan to reduce
20 barriers identified to improve regular attendance. The plan shall
21 include, if agreed to by the person who is responsible for making
22 educational decisions on behalf of the child, an educational evaluation
23 to determine whether any intellectual, academic, physical, or social-
24 emotional barriers are contributing factors to the lack of attendance.
25 The plan shall also consider, but not be limited to:
26 (i) The physical, mental, or behavioral health of the child;
27 (ii) Educational counseling;
28 (iii) Referral to community agencies for economic services;
29 (iv) Family or individual counseling;
30 (v) Assisting the family in working with other community services;
31 and
-10-

LB492 LB492
2025 2025
1 (vi) Referral to restorative justice practices or services.
2 (3) The school may report to the county attorney of the county in
3 which the person resides when the school has documented the efforts it
4 has made as required by subsection (2) of this section that the
5 collaborative plan to reduce barriers identified to improve regular
6 attendance has not been successful and that the child has accrued twenty
7 days or more of unexcused absences during the school year with a
8 documented loss of educational attainment as a result of such absences
9 been absent more than twenty days per school year. Such referral shall
10 indicate which of the unexcused absences during the school year, if any,
11 were absences excused by a parent or guardian for physical or mental
12 illness. The school shall notify the child's family in writing prior to
13 referring the child to the county attorney. Failure by the school to
14 document the efforts required by subsection (2) of this section is a
15 defense to prosecution under section 79-201 and to adjudication under
16 subdivision (3)(a) or (3)(b) of section 43-247 based upon such absences.
17 Illness that makes attendance impossible or impracticable shall not be
18 the basis for referral to the county attorney.
19 (4) Nothing in this section shall preclude a county attorney from
20 being involved at any stage in the process to address excessive
21 absenteeism.
22 Sec. 6. Original sections 79-206 and 79-209, Reissue Revised
23 Statutes of Nebraska, and sections 43-245, 43-247, and 43-276, Revised
24 Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
