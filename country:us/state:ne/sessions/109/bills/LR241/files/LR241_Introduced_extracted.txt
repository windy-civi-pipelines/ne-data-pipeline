examine child care impacts on certified trade apprentices participation in
Nebraska. The study will explore the relationship between affordable and
reliable child care and the success of certified apprenticeships in skilled
trades and workforce participation.
The study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Evaluating the availability, cost, and geographic distribution of
child care options for individuals enrolled in registered apprenticeship
programs;
(2) Reviewing the impact of nontraditional or unpredictable work hours on
child care accessibility and cost for trade apprentices;
(3) Identifying whether access to child care affects enrollment,
retention, and completion rates within apprenticeships particularly for women,
racial and ethnic groups, single parents, and low-income families;
(4) Determining the extent to which current state and federal funding
streams support or exclude apprentices with dependents from accessing child
care assistance;
(5) Studying successful models or pilot programs in other states or
sectors that integrate child care solutions into apprentice programs; and
(6) Providing recommendations for aligning state apprenticeship strategies
with broader childcare, workforce, and economic development goals.
In conducting this interim study, the select committee may confer with
trade unions, apprenticeship program sponsors, community colleges, employers,
parents enrolled in apprenticeships, early childhood education providers,
public agencies, and community organizations to assess how childcare access
