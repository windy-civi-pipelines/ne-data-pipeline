15 housing developments to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and
16 standards.
17 (2) Noncompliance with applicable regulations and standards may
18 result in enforcement actions, such as fines, penalties, or project
19 modifications to bring the development into compliance.
20 Sec. 13. Nothing in the By-Right Housing Development Act shall be
21 construed to invalidate or limit the legality, enforceability, or effect
22 of restrictive covenants or the regulations of any condominium
23 association or homeowners' association. Courts shall recognize and
24 enforce such covenants and regulations in accordance with applicable
25 laws.
