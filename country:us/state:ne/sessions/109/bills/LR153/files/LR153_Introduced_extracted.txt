ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 153
McKeon, 41; Raybould, 28; Storm, 23.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
gather information relating to electronic identification devices utilized as a
method of identifying and managing animals for disease traceability,
surveillance, and control regulations, for use by Nebraska livestock producers
for compliance with such regulations, or for private herd management and
marketing purposes. The study shall compile a list of electronic identification
devices and related animal data collection and management equipment, services,
and software available for purchase and use in Nebraska and shall identify
manufacturers and vendors of such products and the brand names under which such
products are sold.
The study shall also collect information regarding the locations of
manufacturers and the final assembly of electronic identification devices as
well as the manufacturing sources of chip components in such devices. The
information compiled by this study can be used to assist future legislative
deliberations regarding requirements for the sourcing of or limitations on the
use of such devices and related data collection and management systems in order
to mitigate any vulnerabilities to foreign interference in the livestock
industry through the malicious manipulation of such devices and related data
management systems.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Agriculture Committee of the Legislature shall be designated
to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
