2 (2) All inspections by the department shall be unannounced except
3 for initial licensure visits and consultation visits. Initial licensure

13 children and at least twice every year for a program licensed to provide
14 child care for thirty or more children. At each unannounced inspection,
15 the inspector shall request from the licensee, and verify, current proof
16 of required liability insurance. If the licensee is unable to provide
17 current proof of liability insurance or has let the required coverage
18 lapse, the department shall notify the licensee that proof of insurance

20 proof of insurance is not provided to the department within three
21 business days, the licensee's license shall be suspended. Licensure shall

23 proof of the required liability insurance as provided in section
24 71-1911.03.

26 in a report designated by the department. The public shall have access to
27 the results of these inspections upon a written or oral request to the
28 department. The request must include the name and address of the program.
29 Additional unannounced inspections shall be performed as often as is
30 necessary for the efficient and effective enforcement of the Child Care
31 Licensing Act.

2 (2) All inspections by the department shall be unannounced except
3 for initial licensure visits and consultation visits. Initial licensure
4 visits are announced visits necessary for a provisional license to be
5 issued to a family child care home I, family child care home II, child

12 for a program licensed to provide child care for fewer than thirty
13 children and at least twice every year for a program licensed to provide
14 child care for thirty or more children. At each unannounced inspection,
15 the inspector shall request from the licensee, and verify, current proof
16 of required liability insurance. If the licensee is unable to provide
17 current proof of liability insurance or has let the required coverage
18 lapse, the department shall notify the licensee that proof of insurance
19 shall be provided to the department within three business days. If such
20 proof of insurance is not provided to the department within three
21 business days, the licensee's license shall be suspended. Licensure shall
22 be restored upon the department's receipt and verification of current
23 proof of the required liability insurance as provided in section
24 71-1911.03.
25 (4) Whenever an inspection is made, the findings shall be recorded
26 in a report designated by the department. The public shall have access to
27 the results of these inspections upon a written or oral request to the
28 department. The request must include the name and address of the program.

30 necessary for the efficient and effective enforcement of the Child Care
