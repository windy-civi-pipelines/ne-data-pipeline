18 children and at least twice every year for a program licensed to provide
19 child care for thirty or more children. At each unannounced inspection,
20 the inspector shall request from the licensee, and verify, current proof

25 proof of insurance is not provided to the department within three
26 business days, the licensee's license shall be suspended. Licensure shall
