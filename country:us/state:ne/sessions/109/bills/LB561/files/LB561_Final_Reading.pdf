-7-

LB561 LB561
2025 2025
1 such permit is requested for a single trip or for continuous or
2 continuing operation. The permit shall include a signed affirmation under
3 oath that, for any load sixteen feet high or higher, the applicant has

5 conductors and infrastructure that cross over the roadway affected by the
6 move and made arrangements with such electric utilities for the safe
7 movement of the load under any high voltage conductors owned by such
8 electric utilities.
9 (3) The department or local authority is authorized to issue or
10 withhold such permit at its discretion or, if such permit is issued, to
11 limit the number of days during which the permit is valid, to limit the
12 number of trips, to establish seasonal or other time limitations within
13 which the vehicles described may be operated on the highways indicated,
14 or to issue a continuous or continuing permit for use on all highways,
15 including the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. The
16 permits are subject to reasonable conditions as to periodic renewal of
17 such permit and as to operation or movement of such vehicles. The
18 department or local authority may otherwise limit or prescribe conditions
19 of operation of such vehicle or vehicles, when necessary to assure
20 against undue damage to the road foundations, surfaces, or structures or
21 undue danger to the public safety. The department or local authority may
22 require such undertaking or other security as may be deemed necessary to
23 compensate for any injury to any roadway or road structure.

25 refers and shall be open to inspection by any peace officer, carrier
26 enforcement officer, or authorized agent of any authority granting such
27 permit. Each such permit shall state the maximum weight permissible on a
28 single axle or combination of axles and the total gross weight allowed.

30 permit. In case of any violation, the permit shall be deemed
31 automatically revoked and the penalty of the original limitations shall
-8-

LB561 LB561
2025 2025
1 be applied unless:
2 (a) The violation consists solely of exceeding the size or weight
3 specified by the permit, in which case only the penalty of the original
4 size or weight limitation exceeded shall be applied; or
5 (b) The total gross load is within the maximum authorized by the
6 permit, no axle is more than ten percent in excess of the maximum load
7 for such axle or group of axles authorized by the permit, and such load
8 can be shifted to meet the weight limitations of wheel and axle loads
9 authorized by such permit. Such shift may be made without penalty if it
10 is made at the state or commercial scale designated in the permit. The
11 vehicle may travel from its point of origin to such designated scale
12 without penalty, and a scale ticket from such scale, showing the vehicle
13 to be properly loaded and within the gross and axle weights authorized by
14 the permit, shall be reasonable evidence of compliance with the terms of
15 the permit; or .
16 (c) Such permit is an overweight raw-milk vehicle permit and the
17 overweight raw-milk vehicle violated subsection (3) of section 4 of this
18 act.
19 (5) The department or local authority issuing a permit as provided
20 in this section may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations with
21 respect to the issuance of permits provided for in this section.
22 (6) The department shall make available applications for permits
23 authorized pursuant to subdivisions (1)(a)(ii) and (1)(a)(iii) of this
24 section in the office of each county treasurer. The department may make

30 permit fee of not to exceed twenty-five dollars, except that:
31 (a) The fee for a continuous or continuing permit may not exceed
-9-

LB561 LB561
2025 2025
1 twenty-five dollars for a ninety-day period, fifty dollars for a one-
2 hundred-eighty-day period, or one hundred dollars for a one-year period;
3 and
4 (b) The fee for permits issued pursuant to subdivision (1)(a)(ii) of
5 this section shall be twenty-five dollars. Permits issued pursuant to
6 such subdivision shall be valid for thirty days and shall be renewable
7 four times for a total number of days not to exceed one hundred fifty
8 days per calendar year.
9 A vehicle or combination of vehicles for which an application for a
10 permit is requested pursuant to this section shall be registered under
11 section 60-3,147 or 60-3,198 for the maximum gross vehicle weight that is
12 permitted pursuant to section 60-6,294 before a permit shall be issued.
13 Sec. 4. (1) The Legislature finds that:
14 (a) Raw milk needs to be promptly processed;

16 haul all available raw milk produced at a dairy farm, which results in
17 some raw milk being wasted;
18 (c) There has been a reduction in the availability of raw milk
19 processing facilities in this state; and
20 (d) The opportunity and need for overweight raw-milk vehicle permits
21 to operate overweight raw-milk vehicles to carry only raw milk from a
22 dairy farm to a milk processing facility for such raw milk is needed due
23 to 23 U.S.C. 127(a)(13), as such section existed on January 1, 2025,
24 concerning the carrying of fluid milk products.
25 (2) For purposes of this section:
26 (a) Bridge map means the map described in subsection (4) of this
27 section;
28 (b) Department means the Department of Transportation;
29 (c) Overweight raw-milk vehicle means a vehicle that has been issued
30 and currently holds an overweight raw-milk vehicle permit;

12 as such section existed on January 1, 2025;
13 (c) Carry a physical or digital copy of the bridge map;
14 (d) Not enter any prohibited bridge structure; and

17 vehicle permit pursuant to written approval from the Federal Highway
18 Administration for such authorization.
19 (4)(a) Prior to January 1, 2026, the department shall create a map
20 of bridge structures in this state onto which an overweight raw-milk
21 vehicle shall not enter.
22 (b) The department shall review the bridge map at least once each
23 year and make any necessary updates to the bridge map.
24 (c) The department shall publish the most recent version of the

31 department of such revocation. Any such notice provided by United States
-11-

LB561 LB561
2025 2025
1 mail is not effective until received by the holder of the revoked permit.
2 (c) Any such revocation may be appealed by the holder of the revoked
3 permit. The appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative
4 Procedure Act.
5 (6) If the department determines that overweight raw-milk vehicle
6 permits put this state at risk of losing federal aid funding, the
7 department shall revoke all such permits.
8 (7) For any overweight raw-milk vehicle that enters a prohibited
9 bridge structure and is the proximate cause of damage to the prohibited
10 bridge structure, the owner of the overweight raw-milk vehicle shall be
11 liable for all costs associated with repairing such damage. The
12 department may bring an action to recover such costs associated with
13 repairing such damage in the district court of the county where the
14 prohibited bridge structure is located or in the district court of
15 Lancaster County. Any money recovered in such action shall be remitted to
16 the State Treasurer for credit to the Roads Operations Cash Fund.
17 (8) The department may grant an exception to section 60-6,290
18 regarding the length of a vehicle if such length is reasonable and is
19 needed for an overweight raw-milk vehicle to comply with all weight
20 limits for single axles and groups of axles.
21 Sec. 5. Original section 60-6,298, Reissue Revised Statutes of
22 Nebraska, and sections 60-601 and 60-6,290, Revised Statutes Cumulative
23 Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
