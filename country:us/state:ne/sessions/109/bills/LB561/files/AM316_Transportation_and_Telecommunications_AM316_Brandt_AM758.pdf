6 particular highways for which permit to operate is requested, and whether
7 such permit is requested for a single trip or for continuous or

9 oath that, for any load sixteen feet high or higher, the applicant has
10 contacted any and all electric utilities that have high voltage
11 conductors and infrastructure that cross over the roadway affected by the

13 movement of the load under any high voltage conductors owned by such
14 electric utilities.

1 enforcement officer, or authorized agent of any authority granting such
2 permit. Each such permit shall state the maximum weight permissible on a
3 single axle or combination of axles and the total gross weight allowed.
4 No person shall violate any of the terms or conditions of such special
5 permit. In case of any violation, the permit shall be deemed
6 automatically revoked and the penalty of the original limitations shall
7 be applied unless:
8 (a) The violation consists solely of exceeding the size or weight
9 specified by the permit, in which case only the penalty of the original
10 size or weight limitation exceeded shall be applied; or
11 (b) The total gross load is within the maximum authorized by the
12 permit, no axle is more than ten percent in excess of the maximum load
13 for such axle or group of axles authorized by the permit, and such load
14 can be shifted to meet the weight limitations of wheel and axle loads
15 authorized by such permit. Such shift may be made without penalty if it
16 is made at the state or commercial scale designated in the permit. The
17 vehicle may travel from its point of origin to such designated scale
18 without penalty, and a scale ticket from such scale, showing the vehicle
19 to be properly loaded and within the gross and axle weights authorized by
20 the permit, shall be reasonable evidence of compliance with the terms of
21 the permit; or .
22 (c) Such permit is an overweight raw-milk vehicle permit and the
23 overweight raw-milk vehicle violated subsection (3) of section 4 of this
24 act.
25 (5) The department or local authority issuing a permit as provided
26 in this section may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations with
27 respect to the issuance of permits provided for in this section.
28 (6) The department shall make available applications for permits

1 to the office of the county treasurer and may make available applications
2 for all permits authorized by this section to any other location chosen
3 by the department.
4 (7) The department or local authority issuing a permit may require a
5 permit fee of not to exceed twenty-five dollars, except that:
6 (a) The fee for a continuous or continuing permit may not exceed
7 twenty-five dollars for a ninety-day period, fifty dollars for a one-
8 hundred-eighty-day period, or one hundred dollars for a one-year period;

11 this section shall be twenty-five dollars. Permits issued pursuant to
12 such subdivision shall be valid for thirty days and shall be renewable
13 four times for a total number of days not to exceed one hundred fifty
14 days per calendar year.
15 A vehicle or combination of vehicles for which an application for a
16 permit is requested pursuant to this section shall be registered under
17 section 60-3,147 or 60-3,198 for the maximum gross vehicle weight that is
18 permitted pursuant to section 60-6,294 before a permit shall be issued.
19 Sec. 4. (1) The Legislature finds that:
20 (a) Raw milk needs to be promptly processed;
21 (b) Lawful truck weight requirements can lead to an inability to
22 haul all available raw milk produced at a dairy farm, which results in
23 some raw milk being wasted;
24 (c) There has been a reduction in the availability of raw milk
25 processing facilities in this state; and
26 (d) The opportunity and need for a special, continuing, or
27 continuous permit to operate vehicles carrying only raw milk from a dairy
28 farm to a milk processing facility for such raw milk is needed due to
29 provisions concerning the hauling of raw milk in the federal Fixing
30 America's Surface Transportation Act, Public Law 114-94.
31 (2) For purposes of this section:
