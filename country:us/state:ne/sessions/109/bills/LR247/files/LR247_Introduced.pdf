LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 247
Introduced by Spivey, 13.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the continued use of restrictive housing and solitary confinement in
Nebraska's correctional facilities, particularly the application to vulnerable
populations and compliance with existing state law.
The study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Reviewing Nebraska's current statutes, regulations, and departmental
policies regarding restrictive housing and solitary confinement;
(2) Evaluating the frequency, and under what circumstances, vulnerable
individuals are placed in restrictive housing;
(3) Assessing compliance with prior legislative reforms and any gaps
between the law and current practice; and
(4) Reviewing potential benefits of proposed reforms and best evidence-
based practices.
In conducting this interim study, the Judiciary Committee of the
Legislature may confer with the Department of Correctional Services, advocacy
groups, public health experts, system-impacted individuals, and other
stakeholders to develop evidence-based policy recommendations that improve
safety and align to evidence-based best practices.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature shall be designated to
conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
