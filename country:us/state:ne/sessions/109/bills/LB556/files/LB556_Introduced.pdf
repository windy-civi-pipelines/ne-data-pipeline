23 accused may move the county court or district court at any time not later
24 than thirty days after arraignment, unless otherwise permitted by the
25 court for good cause shown, to waive jurisdiction in such case to the

9 43-253 (1) Upon delivery to the probation officer of a juvenile who
10 has been taken into temporary custody under section 29-401, 43-248, or
11 43-250, the probation officer shall immediately investigate the situation
12 of the juvenile and the nature and circumstances of the events
13 surrounding his or her being taken into custody. Such investigation may
14 be by informal means when appropriate.
15 (2) The probation officer's decision to release the juvenile from
16 custody or place the juvenile in detention or an alternative to detention
17 shall be based upon the results of the standardized juvenile detention
18 screening instrument described in section 43-260.01.
19 (3) No juvenile who has been taken into temporary custody under
20 subdivision (1)(c) of section 43-250 or subsection (6) of section
21 43-286.01 or pursuant to an alleged violation of an order for conditional
22 release shall be detained in any detention facility or be subject to an
23 alternative to detention infringing upon the juvenile's liberty interest
24 for longer than twenty-four hours, excluding nonjudicial days, after

26 personally before a court of competent jurisdiction for a hearing to
27 determine if continued detention, services, or supervision is necessary.

8 of the juvenile, the probation officer shall immediately release such
9 juvenile to the custody of his or her parent. If the juvenile has both a
10 custodial and a noncustodial parent and the probation officer deems that
11 release of the juvenile to the custodial parent is not in the best
12 interests of the juvenile, the probation officer shall, if it is deemed
13 to be in the best interests of the juvenile, attempt to contact the
14 noncustodial parent, if any, of the juvenile and to release the juvenile
15 to such noncustodial parent. If such release is not possible or not
16 deemed to be in the best interests of the juvenile, the probation officer

28 failure to appear at a scheduled court hearing within the last twelve
