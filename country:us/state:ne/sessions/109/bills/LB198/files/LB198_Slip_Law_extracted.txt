selected by the pharmacy benefit manager or health carrier, the requesting
health care provider or the provider's designee shall provide the requested
date, approximate time, and place of delivery of a clinician-administered drug
at least five business days before the date of delivery. The specialty pharmacy
shall require a signature of the health care provider or the provider's
designee upon receipt of the shipment when shipped to a health care provider.
If any clinician-administered drug dispensed by a specialty pharmacy is not
delivered as specified in this subsection, the covered person shall not be
financially responsible if the clinician-administered drug is not able to be
administered to the covered person.
(3) The requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not
apply when the specialty pharmacy and the health care provider administering
the clinician-administered drug have shared ownership.
(4) A pharmacy benefit manager or health carrier that requires dispensing
of a clinician-administered drug through a specialty pharmacy shall establish
and disclose a process which allows the health care provider or pharmacy to
appeal and have exceptions to the use of a specialty pharmacy when:
(a) A drug is not delivered as specified in subsection (2) of this
section; or
(b) An attending health care provider reasonably believes a covered person
may experience harm without the immediate use of a clinician-administered drug
that a health care provider or pharmacy has in stock.
(5) A pharmacy benefit manager or health carrier shall not:
(a) Require a specialty pharmacy to dispense a covered clinician-
administered drug directly to a covered person with the intention that the
covered person will transport the clinician-administered drug to a health care
provider for administration;
(b) Refuse to authorize or reimburse a participating provider for
dispensing a covered clinician-administered drug based on costs if the costs of
the drug to the health benefit plan are substantially similar as compared to
the costs of the drug if provided from a specialty pharmacy selected by the
pharmacy benefit manager or health carrier;
(c) Refuse to authorize or reimburse a participating provider pursuant to
the network agreement for the administration of covered clinician-administered
drugs;
(d) Penalize or remove from the network a participating provider solely
for refusing to administer a covered clinician-administered drug received from
a specialty pharmacy selected by the pharmacy benefit manager or health
carrier. If a participating provider refuses to source covered clinician-
administered drugs from a specialty pharmacy selected by the pharmacy benefit
manager or health carrier, the participating provider shall direct the covered
person to contact the health carrier for coverage options; or
(e) Require a covered person to obtain a clinician-administered drug from
a specialty pharmacy selected by the pharmacy benefit manager or health carrier
if a participating provider of the covered person's choice sources the drug and
provides for administration at substantially similar costs.
Sec. 5. (1) A health benefit plan, health carrier, or pharmacy benefit
manager shall not:
(a) Require a covered person, as a condition of payment or reimbursement,
to obtain pharmacist services exclusively through the mail-order pharmacy or
pharmacy benefit manager affiliate;
(b) Prohibit or limit a covered person from selecting a network pharmacist
or network pharmacy of the covered person's choice;
(c) Transfer a covered person's prescriptions from a network pharmacy to
another pharmacy unless requested by the covered person;
(d) Use financial incentives, including, but not limited to, adjustments
in cost-sharing obligations of a covered person, to the exclusive benefit of
the pharmacy benefit manager affiliate pharmacy; or
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (2)(b) of this section, auto-enroll
a covered person in mail-order pharmacist services.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a health benefit
plan, health carrier, or pharmacy benefit manager from:
(a) Requiring a covered person to use a network specialty pharmacy;
(b) Auto-enrolling a covered person in mail-order pharmacist services for
a maintenance medication, provided that a covered person:
(i) Shall not be auto-enrolled for the first ninety days of a new
maintenance medication; and
(ii) Shall have the ability to opt out of mail-order pharmacist services
at any time;

(c) Informing a covered person of an ability to obtain pharmacist services
at a lower cost; or
(d) Requiring a covered person to obtain pharmacist services from a mail-
order pharmacy or pharmacy benefit manager affiliate when such services are not
otherwise available from another network pharmacy.
Sec. 6. (1) A network pharmacy or network pharmacist may decline to
provide a drug if the pharmacy or pharmacist will be or is paid less than the
acquisition cost for the drug.
(2) If a network pharmacy or network pharmacist declines to provide a drug
as authorized in subsection (1) of this section, the pharmacy or pharmacist
shall provide the covered person with adequate information as to where the
prescription for the drug may be filled or shall refer the covered person to
his or her plan sponsor.
(3) A pharmacy benefit manager, pharmacy services administrative
organization, or any person acting on behalf of a pharmacy benefit manager or
pharmacy services administrative organization shall not penalize, remove from
the network, or otherwise retaliate against a network pharmacy or network
pharmacist solely for declining to provide a drug as provided in subsection (1)
of this section.
Sec. 7. (1) A contract between a retail pharmacy and a pharmacy benefit
manager or plan sponsor shall not prohibit the retail pharmacy from offering
the following as an ancillary service of the retail pharmacy:
(a) The delivery of a prescription drug by mail or common carrier to a
covered person or his or her personal representative on request of the covered
person or personal representative if the request is made before the drug is
delivered; or
(b) The delivery of a prescription to a covered person or his or her
personal representative by an employee or contractor of the retail pharmacy.
(2) Nothing in this section shall require a retail pharmacy to receive a
request from a covered person or his or her personal representative for
delivery of a drug by mail, common carrier, or an employee or contractor of the
retail pharmacy when refilling or renewing prescription drug services for which
a request was previously received, so long as the retail pharmacy has confirmed
that the covered person wishes to receive the drug.
(3) A pharmacy benefit manager or plan sponsor shall not remove a retail
pharmacy from its networks or require a retail pharmacy to join a mail-order
pharmacy network for the sole reason of providing ancillary delivery services
as long as the ancillary delivery services were provided in compliance with
this section and with the terms and conditions of the retail pharmacy's
contract with the pharmacy benefit manager or plan sponsor and its pharmacy
services administrative organization, if applicable.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in a contract described in subsection (1)
of this section, a retail pharmacy shall not charge a plan sponsor or pharmacy
benefit manager for the delivery service described in subsection (1) of this
section.
(5) If a retail pharmacy provides a delivery service described in
subsection (1) of this section to a covered person, the retail pharmacy shall
disclose both of the following to the covered person or his or her personal
representative:
(a) Any fee charged to the covered person for the delivery of a
prescription drug; and
(b) That the plan sponsor or pharmacy benefit manager may not reimburse
the covered person for the fee described in subdivision (a) of this subsection.
(6) For purposes of this section, retail pharmacy means a pharmacy that
dispenses prescription drugs to the public at retail primarily to individuals
who reside in close proximity or who are receiving care from a provider in
close proximity to the pharmacy, typically by face-to-face interaction with the
individual or the individual's caregiver.
Sec. 8. (1) A contract between a pharmacy benefit manager and a health
benefit plan that is issued on or after January 1, 2026, shall not contain
spread pricing unless such contract is an extension of a contract entered into
prior to January 1, 2026, which included spread pricing.
(2) Beginning January 1, 2029, no contract between a pharmacy benefit
manager and a health benefit plan shall include spread pricing.
Sec. 9. This act becomes operative on January 1, 2026.
Sec. 10. Original sections 44-4601, 44-4603, and 44-4610, Revised
