AMENDMENTS TO LB527
(Amendments to E&R amendments, ER13)
Introduced by Jacobson, 42.
1 1. Strike the original sections and all amendments thereto and
2 insert the following new sections:
3 Section 1. Sections 1 to 8 of this act shall be known and may be
4 cited as the Medicaid Access and Quality Act.
5 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
6 (1) Wide discrepancies between medicaid reimbursement rates and
7 rates of other payers have created challenges to health care access for
8 Nebraska residents covered by medicaid;
9 (2) Approximately one-third of pregnant women, newborns, and
10 children are covered by medicaid and access to health care services is
11 critical for them. Access to labor and delivery services is critical to
12 fostering healthy mothers and babies;
13 (3) Access to primary care is vital to the health of Nebraska
14 communities. Investment in preventative care will help reduce future
15 health care costs to the state and its residents. Improved health
16 outcomes are more likely when patients have access to, and positive
17 relationships with, their primary care provider;
18 (4) Health care access challenges in rural areas have reached a
19 critical point, which requires bold investment and leadership from the
20 state to maintain the health of our rural citizens and communities; and
21 (5) Investment in physical health care access and quality in the
22 medicaid program is an investment in bolstering Nebraska's health care
23 landscape as a whole, addressing health care deserts across the state,
24 and improving the health and prosperity of Nebraska communities.
25 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Medicaid Access and Quality Act:
26 (1) Nonhospital provider means a provider of physical health

1 services that does not hold a license as a hospital under the Health Care
2 Facility Licensure Act;
3 (2) Physical health services means services billed under the
4 medicaid practitioner fee schedule to meet the physical health needs of a
5 patient; and
6 (3) Rural means any county in Nebraska having a population of less
7 than one hundred thousand residents.
8 Sec. 4. (1) No later than January 1, 2026, the Director of
9 Insurance shall establish a schedule for the collection of a tax of six
10 percent of the gross amount of non-medicare direct writing premiums
11 written under a health maintenance organization certificate of authority
12 pursuant to section 44-32,115, to the extent not preempted by federal
13 law, during the current year for business done in the state. The director
14 shall remit the tax paid under this section to the State Treasurer. The
15 State Treasurer shall annually credit the entirety of the tax remitted to
16 the Medicaid Access and Quality Fund.
17 (2) No later than August 1, 2025, the Department of Health and Human
18 Services shall amend the medicaid state plan or file other federal
19 authorizing documents necessary to receive federal financial
20 participation for the Medicaid Access and Quality Act.
21 (3) The tax established by this section shall be effective January
22 1, 2026, and applies to premiums received during the current calendar
23 year and each year thereafter.
24 Sec. 5. The Medicaid Access and Quality Fund is created. Interest
25 earned on the fund shall be credited to the fund. Any money in the fund
26 available for investment shall be invested by the state investment
27 officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska
28 State Funds Investment Act.
29 Sec. 6. (1) The Department of Health and Human Services shall use
30 the Medicaid Access and Quality Fund for the following purposes:
31 (a) Beginning January 1, 2026, forty million dollars annually shall
-2-

1 be used to obtain federal financial participation for the purpose of
2 enhancing rates paid to nonhospital providers of physical health
3 services, as published in the medicaid practitioner fee schedule. This
4 funding shall not be used to replace or offset existing state funds paid
5 to providers for providing services under the medical assistance program.
6 In calculating a rate enhancement under this subdivision, the department
7 shall work with a statewide association exempt from taxation under
8 section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that primarily
9 represents health care providers in multiple specialties who are licensed
10 to practice medicine and surgery under the Uniform Credentialing Act. It
11 is the intent of the Legislature that a rate enhancement provided by this
12 subdivision should aim to improve access to care through increasing rates
13 across a broad range of physical health services provided by nonhospital
14 providers, with an emphasis on evaluation and management services, labor
15 and delivery services, and rural services;
16 (b) Beginning no later than January 1, 2027, five million dollars
17 annually shall be used to obtain federal financial participation to pay a
18 monthly per-member fee of not less than seventy-five dollars to qualified
19 primary care providers who meet criteria established by the Department of
20 Health and Human Services to serve as a primary care medical home for
21 target populations; and
22 (c) Any remaining funds shall be transferred to the medical
23 assistance program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
24 (2) Use of the funds described in this section is subject to all
25 required federal approvals including any approvals necessary for use of
26 such funds to obtain federal financial participation.
27 Sec. 7. It is the intent of the Legislature that the medicaid
28 practitioner fee schedule rates and the General Fund appropriations for
29 rates established in the fee schedule shall not be reduced in amounts
30 lower than the rates published as of July 1, 2024.
31 Sec. 8. The Department of Health and Human Services may adopt and
