8 Nebraska residents covered by medicaid;
9 (2) Approximately one-third of pregnant women, newborns, and
10 children are covered by medicaid and access to health care services is

16 outcomes are more likely when patients have access to, and positive
17 relationships with, their primary care provider;
18 (4) Health care access challenges in rural areas have reached a
19 critical point, which requires bold investment and leadership from the
20 state to maintain the health of our rural citizens and communities; and
21 (5) Investment in physical health care access and quality in the
22 medicaid program is an investment in bolstering Nebraska's health care
23 landscape as a whole, addressing health care deserts across the state,

15 tax remitted to the Medicaid Access and Quality Fund.
16 (2) No later than August 1, 2025, the Department of Health and Human
