1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 7 of this act shall be known and may be
2 cited as the Medicaid Access and Quality Act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 (1) Wide discrepancies between medicaid reimbursement rates and
5 rates of other payers have created challenges to health care access for
6 Nebraska residents covered by medicaid;
7 (2) Approximately one-third of pregnant women, newborns, and
8 children are covered by medicaid and access to health care services is
9 critical for them. Access to labor and delivery services is critical to
10 fostering healthy mothers and babies;
11 (3) Access to primary care is vital to the health of Nebraska
12 communities. Investment in preventative care will help reduce future
13 health care costs to the state and its residents. Improved health
14 outcomes are more likely when patients have access to, and positive
15 relationships with, their primary care provider;
16 (4) Health care access challenges in rural areas have reached a
17 critical point, which requires bold investment and leadership from the
18 state to maintain the health of our rural citizens and communities; and
19 (5) Investment in physical health care access and quality in the
20 medicaid program is an investment in bolstering Nebraska's health care
21 landscape as a whole, addressing health care deserts across the state,
22 and improving the health and prosperity of Nebraska communities.
23 Sec. 3. For purposes of the Medicaid Access and Quality Act:
24 (1) Nonhospital provider means a provider of physical health
25 services that does not hold a license as a hospital under the Health Care
26 Facility Licensure Act;
27 (2) Physical health services means services billed under the
28 medicaid practitioner fee schedule to meet the physical health needs of a
29 patient; and
30 (3) Rural means any county in Nebraska having a population of less
31 than one hundred thousand residents.

4 written under a health maintenance organization certificate of authority
5 pursuant to section 44-32,115, to the extent not preempted by federal
6 law, during the preceding calendar year for business done in the state.
7 The director shall remit the tax paid under this section to the State
8 Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall annually credit the entirety of the
9 tax remitted to the Medicaid Access and Quality Fund.

11 Services shall amend the medicaid state plan or file other federal
12 authorizing documents necessary to receive federal financial
13 participation for the Medicaid Access and Quality Act.
14 (3) The tax established by this section shall be effective January
15 1, 2026, and applies to premiums received the previous calendar year for

17 obligation, renewal, or new issuance on or after January 1, 2026.

19 earned on the fund shall be credited to the fund. Any money in the fund

24 Medicaid Access and Quality Fund for the following purposes:
25 (1) Beginning January 1, 2026, forty million dollars annually shall
26 be used to obtain federal financial participation for the purpose of
27 enhancing rates paid to nonhospital providers of physical health
28 services, as published in the medicaid practitioner fee schedule. This
29 funding shall not be used to replace or offset existing state funds paid
30 to providers for providing services under the medical assistance program:

2 exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code
3 of 1986 that primarily represents health care providers in multiple
4 specialties who are licensed to practice medicine and surgery under the
5 Uniform Credentialing Act; and
6 (b) It is the intent of the Legislature that a rate enhancement
7 provided by subdivision (1) of this section should aim to improve access
8 to care through increasing rates across a broad range of physical health
9 services provided by nonhospital providers, with an emphasis on
10 evaluation and management services, labor and delivery services, and
11 rural services;
12 (2) Beginning no later than January 1, 2027, five million dollars
13 annually shall be used to obtain federal financial participation to pay a

25 rates established in the fee schedule shall not be reduced in amounts
26 lower than the rates published as of July 1, 2024.
