6 (3) State employees who are regularly employed less than forty hours

9 Legislative Council shall, for vacation leave entitlement purposes, be
10 credited with one continuous year of employment for each two hundred
11 sixty working days such state employee was employed by the Legislature or
12 Legislative Council.
13 (4) As used in this section, state employee shall mean any person or
14 officer employed by the state including the head of any department or
15 agency, except when such a head is a board or commission, and who works a
16 full-time or part-time schedule on an ongoing basis.
17 (5) For purposes of this section, a state employee who has
18 terminated employment with the state for any reason other than
19 disciplinary and who returns to state employment within one year from the
20 date of termination shall have his or her service for vacation leave
21 entitlement computed by combining prior continuous service with current
22 continuous service disregarding the period of absence, except that a

-5-

2025 2025
1 employee shall be entitled to use any vacation time as soon as it has
2 accrued. Any vacation time not used within one calendar year following
3 the calendar year during which the time accrued shall be forfeited. In
4 special and meritorious cases, when to limit the annual leave to the
5 period therein specified would work a peculiar hardship, such leave may
6 be extended in the discretion of the Governor, or in situations involving
7 employees of the Legislature, in the discretion of the Executive Board of
8 the Legislative Council.
9 (7) It is the responsibility of the head of an employing agency to
10 provide reasonable opportunity for a state employee to use rather than
11 forfeit accumulated vacation leave. If a state employee makes a
12 reasonable written request to use vacation leave before the leave must be
13 forfeited under this section and the employing agency denies the request,
14 the employing agency shall pay the state employee the cash equivalent of
15 the amount of forfeited vacation leave that was requested and denied.
16 Such cash payment shall be made within thirty days after the requested
17 and denied vacation leave is forfeited under this section. Such cash
18 payment shall be considered compensation for purposes of a state
19 employee's retirement benefit in a defined contribution or cash balance
20 benefit plan administered by the Public Employees Retirement Board but
21 shall not be considered compensation for purposes of a state employee's
22 retirement benefit in any other defined benefit plan administered by the
23 Public Employees Retirement Board. In determining whether a state
24 employeeâ€™s request to use vacation leave is reasonable, the employing
25 agency shall consider the amount of vacation leave requested, the number
26 of days remaining prior to forfeiture during which the state employee may
27 take vacation leave, the amount of notice given to the employing agency
28 prior to the requested vacation leave, any effects on public safety, and
29 other relevant factors. This subsection shall not apply to state
30 employees who are exempt from the State Personnel System pursuant to
31 subdivisions (1)(g) and (h) of section 81-1316.

1 (8) Each state employee, upon retirement, dismissal, or voluntary
2 separation from state employment, shall be paid for unused accumulated
3 vacation leave. Upon the death of a state employee, the his or her
4 beneficiary of the state employee shall be paid for unused accumulated
5 vacation leave.
6 (9) A permanent state employee who is transferred from one agency to
7 another shall have his or her accrued vacation leave transferred to the
8 receiving agency.
9 (10) The Director of Personnel shall adopt and promulgate such rules
10 and regulations as are necessary to administer this section.

12 Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and section 32-908, Revised
13 Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024, are repealed.
