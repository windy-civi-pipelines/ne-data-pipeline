Section 1:
LR188 LR188
2025 2025
ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 188
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the significance of the state financial partnership with the federal
government in delivering health services to Nebraskans through the medicaid
program. Medicaid is a large part of the state's budget, but provides critical
support for health care and stimulates local economies. Medicaid is complex but
is integral to the federal and state health care system.
In 2024, 342,546 children and adults were insured by medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program. Thirty-two percent of children and youths
up to eighteen years of age in Nebraska are covered by medicaid. Twelve percent
of adults, including disabled Nebraskans and very low-income families, access
health care through medicaid. Thirty-three percent of adults living in rural
areas from nineteen through sixty-four years of age access health care through
medicaid. Eighty-seven percent of youths from twelve to seventeen years of age
in Nebraska with mental health diagnoses access health care through medicaid
and the Children's Health Insurance Program. This study will focus on
understanding the impact of how the programs work in Nebraska and how changes
to funding may impact Nebraskans.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Appropriations Committee of the Legislature shall be
designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this
resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
