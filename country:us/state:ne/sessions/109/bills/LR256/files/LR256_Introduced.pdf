FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 256
Introduced by Bostar, 29.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
examine the trend of increasing numbers of Nebraska voters who register as
nonpartisan and how these voters are currently restricted from fully
participating in partisan primary elections for some statewide, federal, and
local offices.
This study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Examining potential legislative reforms to allow fuller access to all
registered voters to all elections administered with taxpayer dollars;
(2) Examining the increase in the number of Nebraska voters registered as
nonpartisan;
(3) Examining Nebraska's history of openness to nonpartisan access in
state and local elections, including the shift to a nonpartisan unicameral
legislature;
(4) Considering the impact of elections with closed primaries on political
competitiveness;
(5) Determining the public cost of administering closed partisan primary
elections; and
(6) Considering potential reforms to provide full and fair ballot access
in primary elections to nonpartisan voters.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
