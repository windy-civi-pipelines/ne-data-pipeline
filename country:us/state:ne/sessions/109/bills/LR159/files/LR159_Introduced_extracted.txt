examine how the nameplate capacity tax affects the development, operation, and
long-term viability of privately developed renewable energy generation
facilities located in Nebraska. Among several criteria, the study shall
evaluate whether the current nameplate capacity tax framework and rate of three
thousand five hundred eighteen dollars per megawatt continues to support
Nebraska's energy infrastructure goals and renewable energy development
objectives while ensuring fair compensation to localities hosting these
facilities. As part of this evaluation, the study shall determine whether the
current nameplate capacity tax rate remains appropriate given changes in
renewable energy technologies, development costs, and market conditions since
the tax's implementation in 2010, or whether adjustments should be made to
better align with Nebraska's energy development priorities. The study shall
include, but is not limited to, the following:
(1) An analysis of how the nameplate capacity tax has influenced renewable
energy development across Nebraska since its creation in 2010, including an
analysis of revenue collected and distributed;
(2) An assessment of whether the current nameplate capacity tax structure
continues to serve its original purpose of supporting renewable energy
infrastructure development by replacing traditional property taxes while
maintaining appropriate compensation to localities;
(3) An evaluation of changes in renewable energy development costs,
technological efficiencies, and expected facility lifespans and how these and
other factors may necessitate adjustments to the current nameplate capacity tax
rate;

(4) An analysis of how Nebraska's renewable energy tax framework affects
the competitiveness of the state's energy industry compared to other taxes
imposed on energy production from other sources in the state;
(5) A determination of whether the nameplate capacity tax is competitive
with taxes imposed directly or indirectly on renewable energy development in
other states, particularly other states within the Southwest Power Pool;
(6) An analysis of anticipated impacts to businesses, counties, and the
energy development landscape if the nameplate capacity tax rate were increased
or decreased; and
(7) A recommendation of whether the nameplate capacity tax should be
increased, decreased, or remain the same, based on the criteria included in the
study and its impact on Nebraska's energy infrastructure and development goals.
In conducting this interim study, the Natural Resources Committee may
confer with state agencies, county officials, other standing committees of the
Legislature, and owners and operators of privately developed renewable energy
generation facilities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:

Section 2:
1. That the Natural Resources Committee of the Legislature shall be
designated to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this
resolution.

Section 3:
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
