2 Sec. 8. Section 77-202, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
3 2024, is amended to read:
4 77-202 (1) The following property shall be exempt from property
5 taxes:
6 (a) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions to the
7 extent used or being developed for use by the state or governmental
8 subdivision for a public purpose. For purposes of this subdivision:
9 (i) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions means
10 (A) property held in fee title by the state or a governmental subdivision
11 or (B) property beneficially owned by the state or a governmental
12 subdivision in that it is used for a public purpose and is being acquired
13 under a lease-purchase agreement, financing lease, or other instrument
14 which provides for transfer of legal title to the property to the state
15 or a governmental subdivision upon payment of all amounts due thereunder.
16 If the property to be beneficially owned by a governmental subdivision
17 has a total acquisition cost that exceeds the threshold amount or will be
18 used as the site of a public building with a total estimated construction
19 cost that exceeds the threshold amount, then such property shall qualify
20 for an exemption under this section only if the question of acquiring
21 such property or constructing such public building has been submitted at
22 a primary, general, or special election held within the governmental
23 subdivision and has been approved by the voters of the governmental
24 subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, threshold amount means the
25 greater of fifty thousand dollars or six-tenths of one percent of the
26 total actual value of real and personal property of the governmental
27 subdivision that will beneficially own the property as of the end of the
28 governmental subdivision's prior fiscal year; and
29 (ii) Public purpose means use of the property (A) to provide public
30 services with or without cost to the recipient, including the general
31 operation of government, public education, public safety, transportation,
-6-
LB628 LB628
2025 2025
1 public works, civil and criminal justice, public health and welfare,
2 developments by a public housing authority, parks, culture, recreation,
3 community development, and cemetery purposes, or (B) to carry out the
4 duties and responsibilities conferred by law with or without
5 consideration. Public purpose does not include leasing of property to a
6 private party unless the lease of the property is at fair market value
7 for a public purpose. Leases of property by a public housing authority to
8 low-income individuals as a place of residence are for the authority's
9 public purpose;
10 (b) Unleased property of the state or its governmental subdivisions
11 which is not being used or developed for use for a public purpose but
12 upon which a payment in lieu of taxes is paid for public safety, rescue,
13 and emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
14 services to all governmental units providing such services to the
15 property. Except as provided in Article VIII, section 11, of the
16 Constitution of Nebraska, the payment in lieu of taxes shall be based on
17 the proportionate share of the cost of providing public safety, rescue,
18 or emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
19 services unless a general policy is adopted by the governing body of the
20 governmental subdivision providing such services which provides for a
21 different method of determining the amount of the payment in lieu of
22 taxes. The governing body may adopt a general policy by ordinance or
23 resolution for determining the amount of payment in lieu of taxes by
24 majority vote after a hearing on the ordinance or resolution. Such
25 ordinance or resolution shall nevertheless result in an equitable
26 contribution for the cost of providing such services to the exempt
27 property;
28 (c) Property owned by and used exclusively for agricultural and
29 horticultural societies;
30 (d)(i) Property owned by educational, religious, charitable, or
31 cemetery organizations, or any organization for the exclusive benefit of

24 section 71-429, nursing facility as defined in section 71-424, or

27 such property shall be a percentage of the property taxes that would
28 otherwise be due. Such percentage shall be equal to the average
29 percentage of occupied beds in the facility provided to medicaid
30 beneficiaries over the most recent three-year period.

25 or rented thirty days or less and may be returned at the option of the
26 lessee or renter at any time and the personal property is of a type which
27 would be considered household goods or personal effects if owned by an
28 individual. All other personal property owned for purposes of leasing or

6 contract, or land contract is recorded and shall immediately forward the
7 statement to the county assessor. The county assessor shall process the
8 statement according to the instructions of the Property Tax Administrator

2025 2025
1 provided by the Recreational Trail Easement Property Tax Exemption Act.
2 Sec. 8. Section 77-202, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
3 2024, is amended to read:
4 77-202 (1) The following property shall be exempt from property
5 taxes:
6 (a) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions to the
7 extent used or being developed for use by the state or governmental
8 subdivision for a public purpose. For purposes of this subdivision:
9 (i) Property of the state and its governmental subdivisions means
10 (A) property held in fee title by the state or a governmental subdivision
11 or (B) property beneficially owned by the state or a governmental
12 subdivision in that it is used for a public purpose and is being acquired
13 under a lease-purchase agreement, financing lease, or other instrument
14 which provides for transfer of legal title to the property to the state
15 or a governmental subdivision upon payment of all amounts due thereunder.
16 If the property to be beneficially owned by a governmental subdivision
17 has a total acquisition cost that exceeds the threshold amount or will be
18 used as the site of a public building with a total estimated construction
19 cost that exceeds the threshold amount, then such property shall qualify
20 for an exemption under this section only if the question of acquiring
21 such property or constructing such public building has been submitted at
22 a primary, general, or special election held within the governmental
23 subdivision and has been approved by the voters of the governmental
24 subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, threshold amount means the
25 greater of fifty thousand dollars or six-tenths of one percent of the
26 total actual value of real and personal property of the governmental
27 subdivision that will beneficially own the property as of the end of the
28 governmental subdivision's prior fiscal year; and
29 (ii) Public purpose means use of the property (A) to provide public
30 services with or without cost to the recipient, including the general
31 operation of government, public education, public safety, transportation,

1 public works, civil and criminal justice, public health and welfare,
2 developments by a public housing authority, parks, culture, recreation,
3 community development, and cemetery purposes, or (B) to carry out the
4 duties and responsibilities conferred by law with or without
5 consideration. Public purpose does not include leasing of property to a
6 private party unless the lease of the property is at fair market value
7 for a public purpose. Leases of property by a public housing authority to
8 low-income individuals as a place of residence are for the authority's
9 public purpose;
10 (b) Unleased property of the state or its governmental subdivisions
11 which is not being used or developed for use for a public purpose but
12 upon which a payment in lieu of taxes is paid for public safety, rescue,
13 and emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
14 services to all governmental units providing such services to the
15 property. Except as provided in Article VIII, section 11, of the
16 Constitution of Nebraska, the payment in lieu of taxes shall be based on
17 the proportionate share of the cost of providing public safety, rescue,
18 or emergency services and road or street construction or maintenance
19 services unless a general policy is adopted by the governing body of the
20 governmental subdivision providing such services which provides for a
21 different method of determining the amount of the payment in lieu of
22 taxes. The governing body may adopt a general policy by ordinance or
23 resolution for determining the amount of payment in lieu of taxes by
24 majority vote after a hearing on the ordinance or resolution. Such
25 ordinance or resolution shall nevertheless result in an equitable
26 contribution for the cost of providing such services to the exempt
27 property;
28 (c) Property owned by and used exclusively for agricultural and
29 horticultural societies;
30 (d)(i) Property owned by educational, religious, charitable, or

24 section 71-429, nursing facility as defined in section 71-424, or

28 otherwise be due. Such percentage shall be equal to the average

25 or rented thirty days or less and may be returned at the option of the
26 lessee or renter at any time and the personal property is of a type which
27 would be considered household goods or personal effects if owned by an
28 individual. All other personal property owned for purposes of leasing or
