1 section.
2 (5) Beginning July 1, 2026, the State Treasurer shall establish a
3 separate educational savings account for each enrolled student for whom
4 an application is received as provided in subsection (4) of this section.
5 Each fiscal year the State Treasurer or a third-party manager under the

7 hundred dollars from the Student Savings Account Support Fund into the

29 manager under the supervision of the State Treasurer may require receipts

4 not refund, rebate, or share any portion of such payment with the
5 applicant.
6 (7) In order to prevent fraud and theft from educational savings
7 accounts of enrolled students, the State Treasurer shall monitor such
8 accounts, investigate suspicious activity, and conduct random audits of
9 such accounts. Whenever the State Treasurer determines that money from an
10 educational savings account has been used for purposes other than
11 qualified educational expenses, the State Treasurer shall conduct an
12 interview with the applicant or any other person suspected of committing
13 an act of fraud or theft in connection with an account. If the State
14 Treasurer determines that an act of fraud or theft has been committed,
15 the offense shall be reported to the Nebraska State Patrol for
16 investigation. If the Nebraska State Patrol determines that a crime has
17 been committed, the offender shall be charged with the appropriate
18 offense under Nebraska law. In addition, the offender shall be required
19 to pay restitution for the amount taken, and such money shall be
20 deposited into the educational savings account from which it was taken.
21 (8) This section shall not be construed to (a) expand the authority
22 of the state or any political subdivision of the state over any private,
23 denominational, or parochial school or (b) require any approved or
24 accredited private, denominational, or parochial school to modify its
25 academic standards for admission to receive payment from a parent, legal
26 guardian, or enrolled student using funds from an educational savings
27 account pursuant to this section.
28 (9) The State Board of Education may adopt and promulgate rules and
29 regulations to carry out this section.
