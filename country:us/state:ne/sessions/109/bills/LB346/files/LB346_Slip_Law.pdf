assistance to the task force in consultation with staff from the Public Service
Commission and other interested parties. The task force may hire consultants to
assist in carrying out its duties. The task force shall review issues relating
to availability, adoption, and affordability of broadband services in rural
areas of Nebraska. In particular, the task force shall:
(a) Determine how Nebraska rural areas compare to neighboring states and
the rest of the nation in average download and upload speeds and in
subscription rates to higher speed tiers, when available;
(b) Examine the role of the Nebraska Telecommunications Universal Service
Fund in bringing comparable and affordable broadband services to rural
residents and any effect of the fund in deterring or delaying capital
formation, broadband competition, and broadband deployment;
(c) Review the feasibility of alternative technologies and providers in
accelerating access to faster and more reliable broadband service for rural
residents;
(d) Examine alternatives for deployment of broadband services to areas
that remain unserved or underserved, such as funding redirection programs
described in section 86-330, public-private partnerships, funding for
competitive deployment, and other measures, and make recommendations to the
Public Service Commission to encourage deployment in such areas;
(e) Recommend state policies to effectively utilize state universal
service fund dollars to leverage federal universal service fund support and
other federal funding;

(f) Make recommendations to the Governor and Legislature as to the most
effective and efficient ways that federal broadband rural infrastructure funds
received after July 1, 2018, should be expended if such funds become available;
and
(g) Determine other issues that may be pertinent to the purpose of the
task force.
(4) Task force members shall serve on the task force without compensation
but shall be entitled to receive reimbursement for expenses incurred for such
service as provided in sections 81-1174 to 81-1177.
(5) The task force shall meet at the call of the chairperson and shall
present its findings in a report to the Executive Board of the Legislative
Council no later than November 1, 2019, and by November 1 every odd-numbered
year thereafter. The report shall be submitted electronically.
(6) For purposes of this section, broadband services means high-speed
telecommunications capability at a minimum download speed of one hundred
megabits per second and a minimum upload speed of one hundred megabits per
second, and that enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice,
data, and video telecommunications using any technology.

money in the fund available for investment shall be invested by the state
investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the
Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.

Treasurer shall transfer any money remaining in the fund on such date to the
