13 of the committee and may fill vacancies on the committee as they occur.
14 Sec. 24. Section 48-622.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
15 amended to read:
16 48-622.03 (1) There is hereby created the Nebraska Worker Training

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 (3) By July 1 of each year, the board shall prepare an annual
2 program plan for the upcoming fiscal year containing guidelines for the
3 program financed by the Nebraska Training and Support Cash Fund. The
4 guidelines shall include, but not be limited to, guidelines for
5 certifying training providers, criteria for evaluating requests for the
6 use of money under section 48-622.02, and guidelines for requiring
7 employers to provide matching funds. The guidelines shall give priority
8 to training that contributes to the expansion of the Nebraska workforce
9 and increasing the pool of highly skilled workers in Nebraska.
10 (4) By December 31 of each year, the Department of Labor shall
11 provide a report to the Governor covering the activities of the program
12 financed by the Nebraska Training and Support Cash Fund for the previous
13 fiscal year. The report shall contain an assessment of the effectiveness
14 of the program and its administration.
15 Sec. 25. Section 58-202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
16 amended to read:
17 58-202 (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
18 (a) The high cost of agricultural loans and the general
19 unavailability of such loans at favorable rates and terms for farmers,
20 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises have
21 resulted in decreased crop, livestock, and business productivity and
22 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
23 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
24 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
25 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
26 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
27 citizens of this state; and
28 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
29 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
30 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
31 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
-31-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
2 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
3 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
4 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
5 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
6 construction industry;
7 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
8 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
9 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
10 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
11 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
12 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
13 facilities; and
14 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
15 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
16 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
17 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
18 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
19 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
20 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
21 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
22 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
23 food and shelter;
24 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
25 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
26 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
27 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
28 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
29 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
30 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
31 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
-32-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
2 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
3 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
4 facilities to produce and supply energy;
5 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
6 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
7 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
8 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
9 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
10 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
11 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
12 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
13 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
14 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
15 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
16 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
17 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
18 suppliers.
19 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
20 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
21 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
22 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
23 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
24 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
25 and social liabilities to the entire state;
26 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
27 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
28 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
29 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
30 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
31 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
-33-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
2 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
3 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
4 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
5 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
6 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
7 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
8 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
9 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
10 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
11 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
12 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
13 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
14 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
15 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
16 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
17 and protect the public health and welfare;
18 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
19 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
20 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
21 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
22 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
23 needed within this state; and
24 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
25 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
26 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
27 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
28 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
29 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
30 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
31 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
-34-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
2 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
3 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
4 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
5 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
6 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
7 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
8 safe drinking water facilities is great;
9 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
10 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
11 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
12 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
13 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
14 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
15 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
16 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
17 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
18 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
19 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
20 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
21 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
22 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
23 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
24 and
25 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
26 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
27 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
28 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
29 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
30 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
31 section shall prohibit the provision of loans, including loans made
-35-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act prior to July 1, 2026, to a
2 municipality as defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction,
3 development, rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of
4 wastewater treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.
5 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
6 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
7 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
8 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
9 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
10 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
11 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
12 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
13 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
14 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
15 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
16 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
17 educational benefits and services;
18 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
19 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
20 and
21 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
22 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
23 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
24 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
25 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
26 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
27 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
28 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
29 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
30 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
31 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
-36-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
2 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
3 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
4 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
5 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
6 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
7 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
8 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
9 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
10 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
11 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
12 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
13 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
14 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
15 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
16 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
17 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
18 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
19 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
20 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
21 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
22 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
23 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
24 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
25 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
26 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
27 public health and welfare;
28 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
29 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
30 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
31 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
-37-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
2 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
3 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
4 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the
5 financing of solid waste disposal areas and facilities and in the removal
6 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
7 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
8 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
9 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
10 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
11 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save
12 lives, to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
13 (b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for
14 use by Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska
15 Public Safety Communication System Act;
16 (c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
17 required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies.
18 Since the maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the
19 cost of purchasing and operating multiple communication infrastructures
20 is prohibitive, it is imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in
21 their efforts to obtain real and personal property to establish, operate,
22 maintain, and manage public safety communication systems; and
23 (d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
24 political subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal
25 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition,
26 construction, and operation of real and personal property of public
27 safety communication systems.
28 (9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27,
29 2005, and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects,
30 there is a need to increase both the limit on individual net worth and
31 the limit on the aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the
-38-

LB346 LB346
2025 2025
1 authority. Such adjustments are necessary to address the inadequate
2 supply of and pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan
3 financing at interest rates and terms that are consistent with the needs
4 of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural
5 enterprises.
6 (10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
7 (a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy
8 the problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
9 insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
10 powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
11 funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal
12 sources;
13 (b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance
14 Authority Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies
15 and private entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such
16 public-private and intergovernmental cooperation; and
17 (c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made
18 available to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of
19 the economy to enable the authority to address the problems identified in
20 this section.
