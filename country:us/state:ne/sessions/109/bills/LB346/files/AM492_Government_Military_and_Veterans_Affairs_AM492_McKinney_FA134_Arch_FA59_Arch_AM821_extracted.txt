9 Sec. 29. Section 43-4513, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
10 2024, is amended to read:
11 43-4513 (1) The Bridge to Independence Advisory Committee is created
12 within the Nebraska Children's Commission to advise and make
13 recommendations to the Legislature and the Nebraska Children's Commission
14 regarding ongoing implementation of the bridge to independence program,
15 extended guardianship assistance described in section 43-4511, and
16 extended adoption assistance described in section 43-4512. The Bridge to
17 Independence Advisory Committee terminates on July 1, 2026, and the
18 Nebraska Children's Commission shall carry out the duties under this
19 section. The Bridge to Independence Advisory Committee shall provide a
20 written report regarding ongoing implementation, including participation
21 in the bridge to independence program, extended guardianship assistance
22 described in section 43-4511, and extended adoption assistance described
23 in section 43-4512 and early discharge rates and reasons obtained from
24 the department, to the Nebraska Children's Commission, the Health and
25 Human Services Committee of the Legislature, the department, and the
26 Governor by September 1 of each year. The report to the Health and Human
27 Services Committee of the Legislature shall be submitted electronically.
28 (2) The members of the Bridge to Independence Advisory Committee
29 shall include, but not be limited to, (a) representatives from all three
30 branches of government, and the representatives from the legislative and
31 judicial branches of government shall be nonvoting, ex officio members,

2 care, which may be filled on a rotating basis by members of Project
3 Everlast or a similar youth support or advocacy group, (c) one or more
4 representatives from a child welfare advocacy organization, (d) one or
5 more representatives from a child welfare service agency, and (e) one or
6 more representatives from an agency providing independent living
7 services.
8 (3) Members of the committee shall be appointed for terms of two
9 years. The Nebraska Children's Commission shall appoint the chairperson
10 of the committee and may fill vacancies on the committee as they occur.
11 Sec. 30. Section 58-202, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
12 amended to read:
13 58-202 (1) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
14 (a) The high cost of agricultural loans and the general
15 unavailability of such loans at favorable rates and terms for farmers,
16 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises have
17 resulted in decreased crop, livestock, and business productivity and
18 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
19 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
20 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
21 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
22 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
23 citizens of this state; and
24 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
25 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
26 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
27 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
28 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
29 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
30 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
31 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
-30-
AM492 AM492
LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
2 construction industry;
3 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
4 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
5 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
6 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
7 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
8 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
9 facilities; and
10 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
11 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
12 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
13 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
14 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
15 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
16 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
17 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
18 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
19 food and shelter;
20 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
21 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
22 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
23 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
24 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
25 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
26 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
27 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
28 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
29 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
30 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
31 facilities to produce and supply energy;
-31-
AM492 AM492
LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
2 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
3 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
4 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
5 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
6 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
7 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
8 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
9 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
10 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
11 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
12 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
13 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
14 suppliers.
15 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
16 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
17 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
18 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
19 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
20 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
21 and social liabilities to the entire state;
22 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
23 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
24 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
25 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
26 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
27 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
28 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
29 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
30 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
31 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
-32-
AM492 AM492
LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
2 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
3 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
4 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
5 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
6 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
7 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
8 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
9 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
10 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
11 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
12 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
13 and protect the public health and welfare;
14 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
15 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
16 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
17 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
18 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
19 needed within this state; and
20 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
21 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
22 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
23 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
24 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
25 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
26 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
27 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
28 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
29 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
30 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
31 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
-33-
AM492 AM492
LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
2 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
3 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
4 safe drinking water facilities is great;
5 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
6 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
7 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
8 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
9 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
10 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
11 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
12 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
13 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
14 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
15 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
16 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
17 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
18 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
19 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
20 and
21 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
22 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
23 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
24 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
25 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
26 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
27 section shall prohibit the provision of loans, including loans made
28 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act prior to July 1, 2026, to a
29 municipality as defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction,
30 development, rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of
31 wastewater treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.

MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
2 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
3 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
4 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
5 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
6 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
7 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
8 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
9 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
10 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
11 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
12 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
13 educational benefits and services;
14 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
15 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
16 and
17 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
18 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
19 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
20 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
21 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
22 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
23 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
24 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
25 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
26 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
27 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
28 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
29 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
30 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
31 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
-35-
AM492 AM492
LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
2 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
3 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
4 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
5 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
6 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
7 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
8 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
9 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
10 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
11 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
12 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
13 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
14 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
15 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
16 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
17 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
18 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
19 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
20 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
21 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
22 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
23 public health and welfare;
24 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
25 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
26 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
27 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
28 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
29 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
30 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
31 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the

MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 financing of solid waste disposal areas and facilities and in the removal
2 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
3 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
4 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
5 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
6 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
7 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save
8 lives, to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
9 (b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for
10 use by Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska
11 Public Safety Communication System Act;
12 (c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
13 required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies.
14 Since the maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the
15 cost of purchasing and operating multiple communication infrastructures
16 is prohibitive, it is imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in
17 their efforts to obtain real and personal property to establish, operate,
18 maintain, and manage public safety communication systems; and
19 (d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
20 political subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal
21 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition,
22 construction, and operation of real and personal property of public
23 safety communication systems.
24 (9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27,
25 2005, and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects,
26 there is a need to increase both the limit on individual net worth and
27 the limit on the aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the
28 authority. Such adjustments are necessary to address the inadequate
29 supply of and pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan
30 financing at interest rates and terms that are consistent with the needs
31 of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural

2 (10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
3 (a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy
4 the problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
5 insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
6 powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
7 funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal
8 sources;
9 (b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance
10 Authority Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies
11 and private entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such
12 public-private and intergovernmental cooperation; and
13 (c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made
14 available to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of
15 the economy to enable the authority to address the problems identified in
16 this section.

18 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
19 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
20 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
21 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
22 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
23 citizens of this state; and
24 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
25 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
26 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
27 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
28 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
29 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
30 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
31 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
-30-

MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
2 construction industry;
3 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
4 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
5 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
6 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
7 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
8 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
9 facilities; and
10 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
11 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
12 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
13 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
14 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
15 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
16 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
17 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
18 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
19 food and shelter;
20 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
21 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
22 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
23 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
24 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
25 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
26 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
27 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
28 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
29 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
30 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
31 facilities to produce and supply energy;
-31-

AM492 AM492
LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
2 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
3 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
4 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
5 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
6 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
7 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
8 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
9 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
10 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
11 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
12 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
13 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
14 suppliers.
15 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
16 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
17 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
18 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
19 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
20 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
21 and social liabilities to the entire state;
22 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
23 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
24 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
25 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
26 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
27 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
28 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
29 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
30 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
31 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
-32-

1 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
2 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
3 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
4 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
5 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
6 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
7 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
8 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
9 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
10 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
11 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
12 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
13 and protect the public health and welfare;
14 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
15 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
16 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
17 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
18 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
19 needed within this state; and
20 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
21 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
22 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
23 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
24 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
25 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
26 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
27 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
28 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
29 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
30 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
31 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
-33-

AM492 AM492
LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
2 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
3 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
4 safe drinking water facilities is great;
5 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
6 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
7 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
8 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
9 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
10 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
11 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
12 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
13 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
14 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
15 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
16 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
17 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
18 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
19 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
20 and
21 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
22 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
23 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
24 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
25 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
26 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
27 section shall prohibit the provision of loans, including loans made
28 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act prior to July 1, 2026, to a
29 municipality as defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction,
30 development, rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of
31 wastewater treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.

1 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
2 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
3 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
4 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
5 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
6 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
7 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
8 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
9 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
10 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
11 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
12 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
13 educational benefits and services;
14 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
15 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
16 and
17 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
18 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
19 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
20 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
21 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
22 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
23 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
24 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
25 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
26 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
27 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
28 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
29 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
30 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
31 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
-35-

LB346 LB346
MMM - 03/03/2025 MMM - 03/03/2025
1 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
2 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
3 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
4 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
5 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
6 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
7 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
8 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
9 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
10 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
11 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
12 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
13 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
14 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
15 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
16 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
17 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
18 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
19 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
20 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
21 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
22 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
23 public health and welfare;
24 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
25 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
26 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
27 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
28 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
29 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
30 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
31 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the

2 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
3 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
4 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
5 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
6 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
7 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save
8 lives, to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
9 (b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for
10 use by Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska
11 Public Safety Communication System Act;
12 (c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
13 required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies.
14 Since the maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the
15 cost of purchasing and operating multiple communication infrastructures
16 is prohibitive, it is imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in
17 their efforts to obtain real and personal property to establish, operate,
18 maintain, and manage public safety communication systems; and
19 (d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
20 political subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal
21 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition,
22 construction, and operation of real and personal property of public
23 safety communication systems.
24 (9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27,
25 2005, and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects,
26 there is a need to increase both the limit on individual net worth and
27 the limit on the aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the
28 authority. Such adjustments are necessary to address the inadequate
29 supply of and pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan
30 financing at interest rates and terms that are consistent with the needs
31 of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural

2 (10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
3 (a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy
4 the problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
5 insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
6 powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
7 funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal
8 sources;
9 (b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance
10 Authority Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies
11 and private entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such
12 public-private and intergovernmental cooperation; and
13 (c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made
14 available to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of
15 the economy to enable the authority to address the problems identified in
16 this section.
