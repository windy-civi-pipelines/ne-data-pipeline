29 resulted in decreased crop, livestock, and business productivity and
30 prevented farmers and other agricultural enterprises from acquiring
31 modern agricultural equipment and processes. These problems have made it
-28-

LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 difficult for farmers and other agricultural enterprises to maintain or
2 increase their present number of employees and have decreased the supply
3 of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the
4 citizens of this state; and
5 (b) There exists in this state an inadequate supply of and a
6 pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan financing at interest
7 rates and terms which are consistent with the needs of farmers,
8 particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural enterprises.
9 (2) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
10 (a) From time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage
11 lenders seriously restrict existing housing transfers and new housing
12 starts and the resultant reduction in residential construction starts
13 causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the
14 construction industry;
15 (b) Such conditions generally result in and contribute to the
16 creation of slums and blighted areas in the urban and rural areas of this
17 state and a deterioration of the quality of living conditions within this
18 state and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
19 public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and
20 safety, fire and accident prevention, and other public services and
21 facilities; and
22 (c) There exists in the urban and rural areas of this state an
23 inadequate supply of and a pressing need for sanitary, safe, and
24 uncrowded housing at prices at which low-income and moderate-income
25 persons, particularly first-time homebuyers, can afford to purchase,
26 construct, or rent and as a result such persons are forced to occupy
27 unsanitary, unsafe, and overcrowded housing.
28 (3) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
29 (a) Adequate and reliable energy supplies are a basic necessity of
30 life and sufficient energy supplies are essential to supplying adequate
31 food and shelter;
-29-

ER61 ER61
LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 (b) The cost and availability of energy supplies has been and will
2 continue to be a matter of state and national concern;
3 (c) The increasing cost and decreasing availability of energy
4 supplies for purposes of residential heating will limit the ability of
5 many of Nebraska's citizens to provide the basic necessities of life and
6 will result in a deterioration in living conditions and a threat to the
7 health and welfare of the citizens of this state;
8 (d) Energy conservation through building modifications including,
9 but not limited to, insulation, weatherization, and the installation of
10 alternative energy devices has been shown to be a prudent means of
11 reducing energy consumption costs and the need for additional costly
12 facilities to produce and supply energy;
13 (e) Because of the high cost of available capital, the purchase of
14 energy conservation devices is not possible for many Nebraskans. The
15 prohibitively high interest rates for private capital create a situation
16 in which the necessary capital cannot be obtained solely from private
17 enterprise sources and there is a need for the stimulation of investment
18 of private capital, thereby encouraging the purchase of energy
19 conservation devices and energy conserving building modifications;
20 (f) The increased cost per capita of supplying adequate life-
21 sustaining energy needs has reduced the amount of funds, both public and
22 private, available for providing other necessities of life, including
23 food, health care, and safe, sanitary housing; and
24 (g) The continuing purchase of energy supplies results in the
25 transfer of ever-increasing amounts of capital to out-of-state energy
26 suppliers.
27 (4) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
28 (a) There exist within this state unemployment and underemployment
29 especially in areas of basic economic activity, caused by economic
30 decline and need for diversification of the economic base, needlessly
31 increasing public expenditures for unemployment compensation and welfare,
-30-

ER61 ER61
LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 decreasing the tax base, reducing tax revenue, and resulting in economic
2 and social liabilities to the entire state;
3 (b) Such unemployment and underemployment cause areas of the state
4 to deteriorate and become substandard and blighted and such conditions
5 result in making such areas economic or social liabilities harmful to the
6 economic and social well-being of the entire state and the communities in
7 which they exist, needlessly increasing public expenditures, imposing
8 onerous state and municipal burdens, decreasing the tax base, reducing
9 tax revenue, substantially impairing or arresting the sound growth of the
10 state and the municipalities, depreciating general state and community-
11 wide values, and contributing to the spread of disease and crime which
12 necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
13 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
14 prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of
15 juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and
16 accident protection, and for other public services and facilities;
17 (c) There exist within this state conditions resulting from the
18 concentration of population of various counties, cities, and villages
19 which require the construction, maintenance, and operation of adequate
20 hospital and nursing facilities for the care of the public health. Since
21 these conditions cannot be remedied by the ordinary operations of private
22 enterprises and since provision of adequate hospital, nursing, and
23 medical care is a public use, it is in the public interest that adequate
24 hospital and medical facilities and care be provided in order to care for
25 and protect the public health and welfare;
26 (d) Creation of basic economic jobs in the private sector and the
27 promotion of health and welfare by the means provided under the Nebraska
28 Investment Finance Authority Act and the resulting reduction of needless
29 public expenditures, expansion of the tax base, provision of hospitals
30 and health care and related facilities, and increase of tax revenue are
31 needed within this state; and
-31-

ER61 ER61
LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 (e) Stimulation of economic development throughout the state and the
2 provision of health care at affordable prices are matters of state
3 policy, public interest, and statewide concern and within the powers and
4 authority inherent in and reserved to the state in order that the state
5 and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which
6 consume an excessive proportion of their revenue, in order that the
7 economic base of the state may be broadened and stabilized thereby
8 providing jobs and necessary tax base, and in order that adequate health
9 care services be provided to all residents of this state.
10 (5) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
11 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
12 municipalities, as defined in section 81-15,149, in providing wastewater
13 treatment facilities and safe drinking water facilities. The federal
14 funding provided for wastewater treatment facilities is extremely limited
15 while the need to provide and improve wastewater treatment facilities and
16 safe drinking water facilities is great;
17 (b) The construction, development, rehabilitation, and improvement
18 of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities
19 are essential to protecting and improving the state's water quality, the
20 provision of adequate wastewater treatment facilities and safe drinking
21 water facilities is essential to economic growth and development, and new
22 sources of financing for such projects are needed;
23 (c) The federal government has acted to end the system of federal
24 construction grants for clean water projects and has instead provided for
25 capitalization grants to capitalize state revolving funds for wastewater
26 treatment projects and will soon expand that to include safe drinking
27 water facilities, and the state has created or is expected to create
28 appropriate funds or accounts for such purpose. The state is required or
29 expected to be required to provide matching funds for deposit into such
30 funds or accounts, and there is a need for financing in excess of the
31 amount which can be provided by the federal money and the state match;
-32-

ER61 ER61
LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 and
2 (d) Additional assistance can be provided to municipalities as
3 defined in section 81-15,149 to alleviate the problems of water pollution
4 or the provision of safe drinking water by providing for the issuance of
5 revenue bonds, the proceeds of which shall be deposited into the
6 Wastewater Treatment Facilities Construction Loan Fund or the comparable
7 state fund to finance safe drinking water facilities. Nothing in this
8 section shall prohibit the provision of loans , including loans made
9 pursuant to the Conservation Corporation Act, to a municipality as
10 defined in section 81-15,149 for the construction, development,
11 rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and improvement of wastewater
12 treatment facilities or safe drinking water facilities.
13 (6) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
14 (a) There is a need within this state for financing to assist public
15 school boards and school districts and private for-profit or not-for-
16 profit schools in connection with removal of materials determined to be
17 hazardous to the health and well-being of the residents of the state and
18 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers and that the
19 federal funding provided for such projects is extremely limited and the
20 need and requirement to remove such materials and to reduce or eliminate
21 accessibility barriers from school buildings is great;
22 (b) The financing of the removal of such environmental hazards and
23 the reduction or elimination of accessibility barriers is essential to
24 protecting and improving the facilities in the state which provide
25 educational benefits and services;
26 (c) The federal government has directed schools to remove such
27 hazardous materials and to reduce or eliminate accessibility barriers;
28 and
29 (d) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
30 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
31 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
-33-

ER61 ER61
LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 encourage the investment of private capital and assist in the financing
2 of the removal of environmental hazards and the reduction or elimination
3 of accessibility barriers in educational facilities in this state in
4 order to provide for a clean, safe, and accessible environment to protect
5 the health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
6 (7) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
7 (a) The rapidly rising volume of waste deposited by society
8 threatens the capacity of existing and future landfills. The nature of
9 waste disposal means that unknown quantities of potentially toxic and
10 hazardous materials are being buried and pose a constant threat to the
11 ground water supply. In addition, the nature of the waste and the
12 disposal methods utilized allow the waste to remain basically inert for
13 decades, if not centuries, without decomposition;
14 (b) Wastes filling Nebraska's landfills may at best represent a
15 potential resource, but without proper management wastes are hazards to
16 the environment and to the public health and welfare;
17 (c) The growing concern with ground water protection and the desire
18 to avoid financial risks inherent in ground water contamination have
19 caused many smaller landfills to close in favor of using higher-volume
20 facilities. Larger operations allow for better ground water protection at
21 a relatively lower and more manageable cost;
22 (d) The reduction of solid waste at the source and the recycling of
23 reusable waste materials will reduce the flow of waste to landfills and
24 increase the supply of reusable materials for the use of the public;
25 (e) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
26 counties, cities, villages, entities created under the Interlocal
27 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act, and private persons with
28 the construction and operation of new solid waste disposal areas or
29 facilities and with the closure, monitoring, and remediation of existing
30 solid waste disposal areas and facilities;
31 (f) Financing the construction and operation of new solid waste
-34-

ER61 ER61
LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 disposal areas and facilities and financing the closure, monitoring, and
2 remediation of existing and former solid waste disposal areas and
3 facilities in the state is essential to protect the environment and the
4 public health and welfare;
5 (g) The federal government has directed that effective October 1,
6 1993, all solid waste disposal areas and facilities shall be upgraded to
7 meet stringent siting, design, construction, operation, closure,
8 monitoring, and remediation requirements; and
9 (h) The problems enumerated in this subsection cannot be remedied
10 through the operation of private enterprise or individual communities or
11 both but may be alleviated through the assistance of the authority to
12 encourage the investment of private capital and to assist in the
13 financing of solid waste disposal areas and facilities and in the removal
14 of environmental hazards in solid waste disposal areas and facilities in
15 this state in order to provide for a clean environment to protect the
16 health and welfare of the citizens and residents of this state.
17 (8) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
18 (a) During emergencies the resources of political subdivisions must
19 be effectively directed and coordinated to public safety agencies to save
20 lives, to protect property, and to meet the needs of citizens;
21 (b) There exists a need for public safety communication systems for
22 use by Nebraska's public safety agencies as defined in the Nebraska
23 Public Safety Communication System Act;
24 (c) Investment in the public safety communication infrastructure is
25 required to ensure the effectiveness of such public safety agencies.
26 Since the maintenance of public safety is a paramount concern but the
27 cost of purchasing and operating multiple communication infrastructures
28 is prohibitive, it is imperative that political subdivisions cooperate in
29 their efforts to obtain real and personal property to establish, operate,
30 maintain, and manage public safety communication systems; and
31 (d) There is a need within this state for financing to assist
-35-

ER61 ER61
LB346 LB346
JNH - 05/05/2025 JNH - 05/05/2025
1 political subdivisions and any entities created under the Interlocal
2 Cooperation Act and the Joint Public Agency Act with the acquisition,
3 construction, and operation of real and personal property of public
4 safety communication systems.
5 (9) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that, as of May 27,
6 2005, and in connection with the financing of agricultural projects,
7 there is a need to increase both the limit on individual net worth and
8 the limit on the aggregate loan amount that may be provided by the
9 authority. Such adjustments are necessary to address the inadequate
10 supply of and pressing need for farm credit and agricultural loan
11 financing at interest rates and terms that are consistent with the needs
12 of farmers, particularly beginning farmers, and other agricultural
13 enterprises.
14 (10) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
15 (a) The amount of funding and other resources available to remedy
16 the problems identified in this section has been, and continues to be,
17 insufficient. Accordingly, the authority must be provided with additional
18 powers to adequately address the problems identified in this section with
19 funding derived from public and private sources and state and federal
20 sources;
21 (b) Carrying out the purposes of the Nebraska Investment Finance
22 Authority Act may necessitate innovative agreements with public agencies
23 and private entities and it is the policy of this state to encourage such
24 public-private and intergovernmental cooperation; and
25 (c) Better, more broad-based sources of financing must be made
26 available to the authority and by the authority to the private sector of
27 the economy to enable the authority to address the problems identified in
28 this section.
