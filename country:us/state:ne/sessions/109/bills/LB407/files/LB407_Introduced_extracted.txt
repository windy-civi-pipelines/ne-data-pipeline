1 Section 1. Section 29-1816, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 29-1816 (1)(a) The accused may be arraigned in county court or
4 district court:
5 (i) If the accused was eighteen years of age or older when the
6 alleged offense was committed;
7 (ii) If the accused was younger than eighteen years of age and was
8 sixteen fourteen years of age or older when an alleged offense punishable
9 as a Class I, IA, IB, IC, ID, II, or IIA felony was committed; or
10 (iii) If the accused was younger than sixteen years of age and was
11 thirteen years of age or older when an alleged offense punishable as a
12 Class I, IA, IB, IC, ID, II, or IIA felony was committed, following a
13 transfer as provided in section 8 of this act; or
14 (iv) (iii) If the alleged offense is a traffic offense as defined in
15 section 43-245.
16 (b) Arraignment in county court or district court shall be by
17 reading to the accused the complaint or information, unless the reading
18 is waived by the accused when the nature of the charge is made known to
19 him or her. The accused shall then be asked whether he or she is guilty
20 or not guilty of the offense charged. If the accused appears in person
21 and by counsel and goes to trial before a jury regularly impaneled and
22 sworn, he or she shall be deemed to have waived arraignment and a plea of
23 not guilty shall be deemed to have been made.
24 (2) At the time of the arraignment, the county court or district
25 court shall advise the accused, if the accused was younger than eighteen
26 years of age at the time the alleged offense was committed, that the
27 accused may move the county court or district court at any time not later
28 than thirty days after arraignment, unless otherwise permitted by the
29 court for good cause shown, to waive jurisdiction in such case to the
30 juvenile court for further proceedings under the Nebraska Juvenile Code.
31 This subsection does not apply if the case was transferred to county
-2-

1 court or district court from juvenile court.
2 (3) For motions to transfer a case from the county court or district
3 court to juvenile court:
4 (a) The county court or district court shall schedule a hearing on
5 such motion within fifteen days. The customary rules of evidence shall
6 not be followed at such hearing. The accused shall be represented by an
7 attorney. The criteria set forth in section 43-276 shall be considered at
8 such hearing. After considering all the evidence and reasons presented by
9 both parties, the case shall be transferred to juvenile court unless a
10 sound basis exists for retaining the case in county court or district
11 court; and
12 (b) The county court or district court shall make a decision on such
13 motion within thirty days after the hearing and shall set forth findings
14 for the reason for its decision. If the county court or district court
15 determines that the accused should be transferred to the juvenile court,
16 the complete file in the county court or district court shall be
17 transferred to the juvenile court and the complaint, indictment, or
18 information may be used in place of a petition therein. The county court
19 or district court making a transfer shall order the accused to be taken
20 forthwith to the juvenile court and designate where the juvenile shall be
21 kept pending determination by the juvenile court. The juvenile court
22 shall then proceed as provided in the Nebraska Juvenile Code.
23 (4) An order granting or denying transfer of the case from county
24 court or district court to juvenile court shall be considered a final
25 order for the purposes of appeal. Upon entry of an order, any party may
26 appeal to the Court of Appeals within ten days. Such review shall be
27 advanced on the court docket without an extension of time granted to any
28 party except upon a showing of exceptional cause. Appeals shall be
29 submitted, assigned, and scheduled for oral argument as soon as the
30 appellee's brief is due to be filed. The Court of Appeals shall conduct
31 its review in an expedited manner and shall render the judgment and
-3-
LB407 LB407

1 opinion, if any, as speedily as possible. During the pendency of an
2 appeal from an order transferring the case to juvenile court, the
3 juvenile court may enter temporary orders in the best interests of the
4 juvenile.
5 (5)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (5)(b) of this section, any
6 admission, confession, or statement made by the accused to a
7 psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, or licensed mental health
8 practitioner for purposes of a motion to transfer a case from county
9 court or district court to juvenile court shall be inadmissible in any
10 criminal or civil proceeding.
11 (b) Subdivision (5)(a) of this section does not prevent any such
12 admission, confession, or statement from being:
13 (i) Admissible in proceedings relating to such motion to transfer;
14 (ii) Admissible in disposition proceedings of such accused under the
15 Nebraska Juvenile Code if the case is transferred to juvenile court;
16 (iii) Included in any presentence investigation report for such
17 accused if the case is not transferred to juvenile court; and
18 (iv) Admissible in such case to impeach such accused during cross-
19 examination if the accused testifies at trial or during juvenile court
20 proceedings and such testimony is materially inconsistent with a prior
21 statement made by the accused to a psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist,
22 or licensed mental health practitioner for purposes of the motion to
23 transfer such case.
24 (6) When the accused was younger than eighteen years of age when an
25 alleged offense was committed, the county attorney or city attorney shall
26 proceed under section 43-274.

10 to a youth rehabilitation and treatment center; or (c) the juvenile is a
11 runaway and a fingerprint check is needed for identification purposes to

13 Sec. 5. Section 43-276, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
14 2024, is amended to read:
15 43-276 (1) The county attorney or city attorney, in making the
16 determination whether to file a criminal charge, file a juvenile court

27 interests of the juvenile; (g) consideration of public safety; (h)
28 consideration of the juvenile's ability to appreciate the nature and

-8-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 beyond his or her minority and, if so, the available alternatives best
2 suited to this purpose; (j) whether the victim or juvenile agree to
3 participate in restorative justice; (k) whether there is a juvenile
4 pretrial diversion program established pursuant to sections 43-260.02 to
5 43-260.07; (l) whether the juvenile has been convicted of or has
6 acknowledged unauthorized use or possession of a firearm; (m) whether a

8 43-2,106.03 or section 8 of this act; (n) whether the juvenile is a
9 criminal street gang member; and (o) such other matters as the parties
10 deem relevant to aid in the decision.
11 (2) Prior to filing a petition alleging that a juvenile is a
12 juvenile as described in subdivision (3)(b) of section 43-247, the county
13 attorney shall make reasonable efforts to refer the juvenile and family
14 to community-based resources available to address the juvenile's
15 behaviors, provide crisis intervention, and maintain the juvenile safely
16 in the home. Failure to describe the efforts required by this subsection
17 shall be a defense to adjudication.
18 Sec. 6. Section 43-279, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
19 2024, is amended to read:
20 43-279 (1) The adjudication portion of hearings shall be conducted
21 before the court without a jury, applying the customary rules of evidence
22 in use in trials without a jury. When the petition alleges the juvenile
23 to be within the provisions of subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of
24 section 43-247 and the juvenile or his or her parent, guardian, or
25 custodian appears with or without counsel, the court shall inform the
26 parties:
27 (a) Of the nature of the proceedings and the possible consequences
28 or dispositions pursuant to sections 43-284 to 43-286, 43-289, and 43-290
29 and section 8 of this act that may apply to the juvenile's case following
30 an adjudication of jurisdiction;
31 (b) Of such juvenile's right to counsel as provided in sections
-9-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 43-272 and 43-273;
2 (c) Of the privilege against self-incrimination by advising the
3 juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian that the juvenile may remain
4 silent concerning the charges against the juvenile and that anything said
5 may be used against the juvenile;
6 (d) Of the right to confront anyone who testifies against the
7 juvenile and to cross-examine any persons who appear against the
8 juvenile;
9 (e) Of the right of the juvenile to testify and to compel other
10 witnesses to attend and testify in his or her own behalf;
11 (f) Of the right of the juvenile to a speedy adjudication hearing;
12 and
13 (g) Of the right to appeal and have a transcript for such purpose.
14 After giving such warnings and admonitions, the court may accept an
15 in-court admission or answer of no contest by the juvenile of all or any
16 part of the allegations in the petition if the court has determined from
17 examination of the juvenile and those present that such admission or
18 answer of no contest is intelligently, voluntarily, and understandingly
19 made and with an affirmative waiver of rights and that a factual basis
20 for such admission or answer of no contest exists. The waiver of the
21 right to counsel shall satisfy section 43-3102. The court may base its
22 adjudication provided in subsection (2) of this section on such admission
23 or answer of no contest.
24 (2) If the juvenile denies the petition or stands mute the court
25 shall first allow a reasonable time for preparation if needed and then
26 consider only the question of whether the juvenile is a person described
27 by section 43-247. After hearing the evidence on such question, the court
28 shall make a finding and adjudication, to be entered on the records of
29 the court, whether or not the juvenile is a person described by
30 subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247 based upon proof
31 beyond a reasonable doubt. If an Indian child is involved, the standard
-10-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 of proof shall be in compliance with the Nebraska Indian Child Welfare
2 Act, if applicable.
3 (3) If the court shall find that the juvenile named in the petition
4 is not within the provisions of section 43-247, it shall dismiss the
5 case. If the court finds that the juvenile named in the petition is such
6 a juvenile, it shall make and enter its findings and adjudication
7 accordingly, designating which subdivision or subdivisions of section
8 43-247 such juvenile is within; the court shall allow a reasonable time
9 for preparation if needed and then proceed to an inquiry into the proper
10 disposition to be made of such juvenile.
11 Sec. 7. Section 43-286, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
12 2024, is amended to read:
13 43-286 (1) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile
14 described in subdivision (1), (2), or (4) of section 43-247:
15 (a) The court may continue the dispositional portion of the hearing,
16 from time to time upon such terms and conditions as the court may
17 prescribe, including an order of restitution of any property stolen or
18 damaged or an order requiring the juvenile to participate in restorative
19 justice programs or community service programs, if such order is in the
20 interest of the juvenile's reformation or rehabilitation, and, subject to
21 the further order of the court, may:
22 (i) Place the juvenile on probation subject to the supervision of a
23 probation officer; or
24 (ii) Permit the juvenile to remain in his or her own home or be
25 placed in a suitable family home or institution, subject to the
26 supervision of the probation officer;
27 (b) When it is alleged that the juvenile has exhausted all levels of
28 probation supervision and options for community-based services and
29 section 43-251.01 has been satisfied, a motion for commitment to a youth
30 rehabilitation and treatment center may be filed and proceedings held as
31 follows:
-11-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 (i) The motion shall set forth specific factual allegations that
2 support the motion and a copy of such motion shall be served on all
3 persons required to be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267;
4 (ii) The Office of Juvenile Services shall be served with a copy of
5 such motion and shall be a party to the case for all matters related to
6 the juvenile's commitment to, placement with, or discharge from the
7 Office of Juvenile Services; and
8 (iii) The juvenile shall be entitled to a hearing before the court
9 to determine the validity of the allegations. At such hearing the burden
10 is upon the state by a preponderance of the evidence to show that:
11 (A) All levels of probation supervision have been exhausted;
12 (B) All options for community-based services have been exhausted;
13 and
14 (C) Placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center is a
15 matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the
16 juvenile or the person or property of another or if it appears that such
17 juvenile is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court;
18 (c) After the hearing, the court may, as a condition of an order of
19 intensive supervised probation, commit such juvenile to the Office of
20 Juvenile Services for placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment
21 center operated in compliance with state law. Upon commitment by the
22 court to the Office of Juvenile Services, the court shall immediately
23 notify the Office of Juvenile Services of the commitment. Intensive
24 supervised probation for purposes of this subdivision means that the
25 Office of Juvenile Services shall be responsible for the care and custody
26 of the juvenile until the Office of Juvenile Services discharges the
27 juvenile from commitment to the Office of Juvenile Services. Upon
28 discharge of the juvenile, the court shall hold a review hearing on the
29 conditions of probation and enter any order allowed under subdivision (1)
30 (a) of this section;
31 (d) The Office of Juvenile Services shall notify those required to
-12-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267, all interested parties, and the
2 committing court of the pending discharge of a juvenile from the youth
3 rehabilitation and treatment center sixty days prior to discharge and
4 again in every case not less than thirty days prior to discharge. Upon
5 notice of pending discharge by the Office of Juvenile Services, the court
6 shall set a continued disposition hearing in anticipation of reentry. The
7 Office of Juvenile Services shall work in collaboration with the Office
8 of Probation Administration in developing an individualized reentry plan
9 for the juvenile as provided in section 43-425. The Office of Juvenile
10 Services shall provide a copy of the individualized reentry plan to the
11 juvenile, the juvenile's attorney, and the county attorney or city
12 attorney prior to the continued disposition hearing. At the continued
13 disposition hearing, the court shall review and approve or modify the
14 individualized reentry plan, place the juvenile under probation
15 supervision, and enter any other order allowed by law. No hearing is
16 required if all interested parties stipulate to the individualized
17 reentry plan by signed motion. In such a case, the court shall approve
18 the conditions of probation, approve the individualized reentry plan, and
19 place the juvenile under probation supervision; and
20 (e) The Office of Juvenile Services is responsible for
21 transportation of the juvenile to and from the youth rehabilitation and
22 treatment center. The Office of Juvenile Services may contract for such
23 services. A plan for a juvenile's transport to return to the community
24 shall be a part of the individualized reentry plan. The Office of
25 Juvenile Services may approve family to provide such transport when
26 specified in the individualized reentry plan.
27 (2) When any juvenile is found by the court to be a juvenile
28 described in subdivision (3)(b) of section 43-247, the court may enter
29 such order as it is empowered to enter under subdivision (1)(a) of this
30 section.
31 (3) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile described in
-13-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247, the court may
2 order the juvenile to be assessed for referral to participate in a
3 restorative justice program. Factors that the judge may consider for such
4 referral include, but are not limited to: The juvenile's age,
5 intellectual capacity, and living environment; the ages of others who
6 were part of the offense; the age and capacity of the victim; and the
7 nature of the case.
8 (4) When a juvenile is placed on probation and a probation officer
9 has reasonable cause to believe that such juvenile has committed a
10 violation of a condition of his or her probation, the probation officer
11 shall take appropriate measures as provided in section 43-286.01.
12 (5)(a) When a juvenile is placed on probation or under the
13 supervision of the court and it is alleged that the juvenile is again a
14 juvenile described in subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section
15 43-247, a petition may be filed and the same procedure followed and
16 rights given at a hearing on the original petition. If an adjudication is
17 made that the allegations of the petition are true, the court may make
18 any disposition authorized by this section for such adjudications and the
19 county attorney may file a motion to revoke the juvenile's probation.
20 (b) When a juvenile is placed on probation or under the supervision
21 of the court for conduct under subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of
22 section 43-247 and it is alleged that the juvenile has violated a term of
23 probation or supervision or that the juvenile has violated an order of
24 the court, a motion to revoke probation or supervision or to change the
25 disposition may be filed and proceedings held as follows:
26 (i) The motion shall set forth specific factual allegations of the
27 alleged violations and a copy of such motion shall be served on all
28 persons required to be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267;
29 (ii) The juvenile shall be entitled to a hearing before the court to
30 determine the validity of the allegations. At such hearing the juvenile
31 shall be entitled to those rights relating to counsel provided by section
-14-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 43-272 and those rights relating to detention provided by sections 43-254
2 to 43-256. The juvenile shall also be entitled to speak and present
3 documents, witnesses, or other evidence on his or her own behalf. He or
4 she may confront persons who have given adverse information concerning
5 the alleged violations, may cross-examine such persons, and may show that
6 he or she did not violate the conditions of his or her probation or
7 supervision or an order of the court or, if he or she did, that
8 mitigating circumstances suggest that the violation does not warrant
9 revocation of probation or supervision or a change of disposition. The
10 hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the juvenile is
11 taken into custody;
12 (iii) The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and shall
13 be flexible enough to consider evidence, including letters, affidavits,
14 and other material, that would not be admissible in an adversarial
15 criminal trial;
16 (iv) The juvenile shall not be confined, detained, or otherwise
17 significantly deprived of his or her liberty pursuant to the filing of a
18 motion described in this section unless the requirements of subdivision
19 (5) of section 43-251.01 and section 43-260.01 have been met. In all
20 cases when the requirements of subdivision (5) of section 43-251.01 and
21 section 43-260.01 have been met and the juvenile is confined, detained,
22 or otherwise significantly deprived of his or her liberty as a result of
23 his or her alleged violation of probation, supervision, or a court order,
24 the juvenile shall be given a preliminary hearing. If, as a result of
25 such preliminary hearing, probable cause is found to exist, the juvenile
26 shall be entitled to a hearing before the court in accordance with this
27 subsection;
28 (v) If the juvenile is found by the court to have violated the terms
29 of his or her probation or supervision or an order of the court, the
30 court may modify the terms and conditions of the probation, supervision,
31 or other court order, extend the period of probation, supervision, or
-15-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 other court order, or enter any order of disposition that could have been
2 made at the time the original order was entered; and
3 (vi) In cases when the court revokes probation, supervision, or
4 other court order, it shall enter a written statement as to the evidence
5 relied on and the reasons for revocation.
6 (6)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (6)(b) of this section and
7 section 8 of this act, the court shall not change a disposition unless
8 the court finds that the juvenile has violated a term or condition of
9 probation or supervision or an order of the court and the procedures in
10 subdivision (5)(b) of this section have been satisfied.
11 (b) Upon motion of the juvenile, the court may modify the terms or
12 conditions of probation or supervision or modify a dispositional order
13 if:
14 (i) All parties stipulate to the particular modification; and
15 (ii) The juvenile has consulted with counsel or has waived counsel.
16 Any waiver must be particular to the modification and shall comply with
17 section 43-3102.
18 (7) Costs incurred on behalf of a juvenile under this section shall
19 be paid as provided in section 43-290.01.
20 (8) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile described in
21 subdivision (4) of section 43-247, the juvenile court shall within thirty
22 days of adjudication transmit to the Director of Motor Vehicles an
23 abstract of the court record of adjudication.
24 Sec. 8. (1) At any time after the disposition of a juvenile
25 described in subdivision (1)(a)(iii) of section 29-1816, the county
26 attorney may file a motion requesting the juvenile court to dismiss the
27 petition and authorize the county attorney to refile any charges
28 described in such subdivision as a criminal proceeding in district court.
29 (2)(a) The juvenile court shall schedule a hearing on such motion
30 within fifteen days after the motion is filed.
31 (b) The juvenile shall be represented by counsel at the hearing and
-16-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 may present the evidence as to why the proceeding should be retained.
2 (c) After considering all the evidence and reasons presented by both
3 parties, the juvenile court shall retain the proceeding unless the court
4 determines that the county attorney has shown, by a preponderance of the
5 evidence, that the juvenile is not amenable to rehabilitation under the
6 Nebraska Juvenile Code and that a criminal proceeding would be more
7 appropriate.
8 (d) The juvenile court shall make a decision on the motion within
9 thirty days after the hearing. The juvenile court shall set forth
10 findings for the reason for its decision.
11 (3) An order granting or denying a motion under this section shall
12 be considered a final order for the purposes of appeal. Upon the entry of
13 an order, any party may appeal to the Court of Appeals within ten days.
14 Such review shall be advanced on the court docket without an extension of
15 time granted to any party except upon a showing of exceptional cause.
16 Appeals shall be submitted, assigned, and scheduled for oral argument as
17 soon as the appellee's brief is due to be filed. The Court of Appeals
18 shall conduct its review in an expedited manner and shall render the
19 judgment and opinion, if any, as speedily as possible. During the
20 pendency of any such appeal, the juvenile court may continue to enter
21 temporary orders in the best interests of the juvenile pursuant to
22 section 43-295.
23 (4) If the motion is granted, the county attorney or city attorney
24 shall file a criminal information in the district court and the juvenile
25 shall be arraigned as provided for a person eighteen years of age or
26 older in subdivision (1)(b) of section 29-1816.
27 (5) If a motion under this section is granted, any statute of
28 limitations for an offense described in subdivision (1)(a)(iii) of
29 section 29-1816, including a statute of limitations which would otherwise
30 have expired, shall be extended until the later of:
31 (a) One year after the date the motion to transfer is granted; or
-17-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 (b) One year after entry of final judgment in an appeal concerning
2 the motion to transfer.
3 (6) An order under this section shall be considered by the county
4 attorney in making a future determination under section 43-276 regarding
5 such juvenile and by the court when considering a future transfer motion
6 under section 29-1816 or 43-274 or this section or any future charge or
7 petition regarding such juvenile.
8 (7)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (7)(b) of this section, any
9 admission, confession, or statement made by the juvenile in a proceeding
10 under this section shall be inadmissible in any criminal or civil
11 proceeding.
12 (b) This subsection does not prevent any such admission, confession,
13 or statement from being:
14 (i) Admissible in proceedings relating to the motion under this
15 section;
16 (ii) Admissible in any subsequent proceedings for such juvenile
17 under the Nebraska Juvenile Code if the case is not transferred to
18 district court;
19 (iii) Included in any presentence investigation report for such
20 juvenile if the case is transferred to district court; and
21 (iv) Admissible in such case to impeach such juvenile during cross-
22 examination if the juvenile testifies at trial or during juvenile court
23 proceedings and such testimony is materially inconsistent with the
24 admission, confession, or statement.
25 Sec. 9. Section 43-2,106.03, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska,
26 is amended to read:
27 43-2,106.03 Any time after the disposition of a juvenile described
28 in subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247, upon the
29 motion of any party or the court on its own motion, a hearing may be held
30 regarding the amenability of the juvenile to the rehabilitative services
31 that can be provided under the Nebraska Juvenile Code. The court may
-18-
LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 enter an order, based upon evidence presented at the hearing, finding
2 that a juvenile is not amenable to rehabilitative services that can be
3 provided under the Nebraska Juvenile Code. The reasons for such a finding
4 shall be stated in the order. Such an order shall be considered by the
5 county attorney in making a future determination under section 43-276
6 regarding such juvenile and by the court when considering a future
7 transfer motion under section 29-1816 or 43-274 or section 8 of this act
8 or any future charge or petition regarding such juvenile.
9 Sec. 10. Section 43-2,129, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,

18 escape from a youth rehabilitation and treatment center, the chief
19 executive officer of the youth rehabilitation and treatment center shall
20 document the assault, escape, or attempt to escape and send a copy of
21 such documentation to the committing court and the county attorney of the
22 county in which the committing court is located as soon as possible after
23 the determination that such assault, escape, or attempt to escape has
24 occurred. Such documentation may be offered as evidence presented at any
25 hearing conducted pursuant to section 43-2,106.03 or section 8 of this
26 act.

Committee: Judiciary
1 A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; to amend sections 43-252,
2 43-2,106.03, and 43-424, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and
3 sections 29-1816, 43-246.01, 43-251.01, 43-276, 43-279, 43-286, and
4 43-2,129, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024; to provide
5 for criminal proceedings against certain juveniles charged with
6 felonies following unsuccessful rehabilitation under the Nebraska

10 Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,
-1-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 Section 1. Section 29-1816, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 29-1816 (1)(a) The accused may be arraigned in county court or
4 district court:
5 (i) If the accused was eighteen years of age or older when the
6 alleged offense was committed;
7 (ii) If the accused was younger than eighteen years of age and was
8 sixteen fourteen years of age or older when an alleged offense punishable
9 as a Class I, IA, IB, IC, ID, II, or IIA felony was committed; or
10 (iii) If the accused was younger than sixteen years of age and was
11 thirteen years of age or older when an alleged offense punishable as a
12 Class I, IA, IB, IC, ID, II, or IIA felony was committed, following a
13 transfer as provided in section 8 of this act; or
14 (iv) (iii) If the alleged offense is a traffic offense as defined in
15 section 43-245.
16 (b) Arraignment in county court or district court shall be by
17 reading to the accused the complaint or information, unless the reading
18 is waived by the accused when the nature of the charge is made known to
19 him or her. The accused shall then be asked whether he or she is guilty
20 or not guilty of the offense charged. If the accused appears in person
21 and by counsel and goes to trial before a jury regularly impaneled and
22 sworn, he or she shall be deemed to have waived arraignment and a plea of
23 not guilty shall be deemed to have been made.
24 (2) At the time of the arraignment, the county court or district
25 court shall advise the accused, if the accused was younger than eighteen
26 years of age at the time the alleged offense was committed, that the
27 accused may move the county court or district court at any time not later
28 than thirty days after arraignment, unless otherwise permitted by the
29 court for good cause shown, to waive jurisdiction in such case to the
30 juvenile court for further proceedings under the Nebraska Juvenile Code.
31 This subsection does not apply if the case was transferred to county
-2-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 court or district court from juvenile court.
2 (3) For motions to transfer a case from the county court or district
3 court to juvenile court:
4 (a) The county court or district court shall schedule a hearing on
5 such motion within fifteen days. The customary rules of evidence shall
6 not be followed at such hearing. The accused shall be represented by an
7 attorney. The criteria set forth in section 43-276 shall be considered at
8 such hearing. After considering all the evidence and reasons presented by
9 both parties, the case shall be transferred to juvenile court unless a
10 sound basis exists for retaining the case in county court or district
11 court; and
12 (b) The county court or district court shall make a decision on such
13 motion within thirty days after the hearing and shall set forth findings
14 for the reason for its decision. If the county court or district court
15 determines that the accused should be transferred to the juvenile court,
16 the complete file in the county court or district court shall be
17 transferred to the juvenile court and the complaint, indictment, or
18 information may be used in place of a petition therein. The county court
19 or district court making a transfer shall order the accused to be taken
20 forthwith to the juvenile court and designate where the juvenile shall be
21 kept pending determination by the juvenile court. The juvenile court
22 shall then proceed as provided in the Nebraska Juvenile Code.
23 (4) An order granting or denying transfer of the case from county
24 court or district court to juvenile court shall be considered a final
25 order for the purposes of appeal. Upon entry of an order, any party may
26 appeal to the Court of Appeals within ten days. Such review shall be
27 advanced on the court docket without an extension of time granted to any
28 party except upon a showing of exceptional cause. Appeals shall be
29 submitted, assigned, and scheduled for oral argument as soon as the
30 appellee's brief is due to be filed. The Court of Appeals shall conduct
31 its review in an expedited manner and shall render the judgment and
-3-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 opinion, if any, as speedily as possible. During the pendency of an
2 appeal from an order transferring the case to juvenile court, the
3 juvenile court may enter temporary orders in the best interests of the
4 juvenile.
5 (5)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (5)(b) of this section, any
6 admission, confession, or statement made by the accused to a
7 psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, or licensed mental health
8 practitioner for purposes of a motion to transfer a case from county
9 court or district court to juvenile court shall be inadmissible in any
10 criminal or civil proceeding.
11 (b) Subdivision (5)(a) of this section does not prevent any such
12 admission, confession, or statement from being:
13 (i) Admissible in proceedings relating to such motion to transfer;
14 (ii) Admissible in disposition proceedings of such accused under the
15 Nebraska Juvenile Code if the case is transferred to juvenile court;
16 (iii) Included in any presentence investigation report for such
17 accused if the case is not transferred to juvenile court; and
18 (iv) Admissible in such case to impeach such accused during cross-
19 examination if the accused testifies at trial or during juvenile court
20 proceedings and such testimony is materially inconsistent with a prior
21 statement made by the accused to a psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist,
22 or licensed mental health practitioner for purposes of the motion to
23 transfer such case.
24 (6) When the accused was younger than eighteen years of age when an
25 alleged offense was committed, the county attorney or city attorney shall
26 proceed under section 43-274.
27 Sec. 2. Section 43-246.01, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
28 2024, is amended to read:
29 43-246.01 (1) The juvenile court shall have exclusive original

3 alleged offense was committed and the offense falls under subdivision (1)
4 of section 43-247;
5 (c) A party or proceeding described in subdivision (5) or (7) of
6 section 43-247; and
7 (d) Any juvenile who was under sixteen fourteen years of age at the
8 time the alleged offense was committed and the offense falls under
9 subdivision (2) of section 43-247.
10 (2)(a) The juvenile court shall also have exclusive original
11 jurisdiction as to:

15 (ii) Any juvenile who was sixteen fourteen years of age or older at
16 the time the alleged offense was committed and the offense falls under
17 subdivision (2) of section 43-247 except offenses enumerated in

16 (7) A juvenile alleged to be a juvenile as described in subdivision
17 (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247 shall not be placed out of his

10 to a youth rehabilitation and treatment center; or (c) the juvenile is a
11 runaway and a fingerprint check is needed for identification purposes to

13 Sec. 5. Section 43-276, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
14 2024, is amended to read:
15 43-276 (1) The county attorney or city attorney, in making the
16 determination whether to file a criminal charge, file a juvenile court
17 petition, offer juvenile pretrial diversion or restorative justice, or
18 transfer a case to or from juvenile court, and the juvenile court, county

27 interests of the juvenile; (g) consideration of public safety; (h)
28 consideration of the juvenile's ability to appreciate the nature and
29 seriousness of his or her conduct; (i) whether the best interests of the

31 continue in secure detention or under supervision for a period extending
-8-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 beyond his or her minority and, if so, the available alternatives best
2 suited to this purpose; (j) whether the victim or juvenile agree to

9 criminal street gang member; and (o) such other matters as the parties
10 deem relevant to aid in the decision.
11 (2) Prior to filing a petition alleging that a juvenile is a

13 attorney shall make reasonable efforts to refer the juvenile and family
14 to community-based resources available to address the juvenile's
15 behaviors, provide crisis intervention, and maintain the juvenile safely
16 in the home. Failure to describe the efforts required by this subsection
17 shall be a defense to adjudication.
18 Sec. 6. Section 43-279, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
19 2024, is amended to read:
20 43-279 (1) The adjudication portion of hearings shall be conducted
21 before the court without a jury, applying the customary rules of evidence
22 in use in trials without a jury. When the petition alleges the juvenile
23 to be within the provisions of subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of
24 section 43-247 and the juvenile or his or her parent, guardian, or
25 custodian appears with or without counsel, the court shall inform the
26 parties:
27 (a) Of the nature of the proceedings and the possible consequences
28 or dispositions pursuant to sections 43-284 to 43-286, 43-289, and 43-290
29 and section 8 of this act that may apply to the juvenile's case following
30 an adjudication of jurisdiction;
31 (b) Of such juvenile's right to counsel as provided in sections
-9-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 43-272 and 43-273;
2 (c) Of the privilege against self-incrimination by advising the
3 juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian that the juvenile may remain
4 silent concerning the charges against the juvenile and that anything said
5 may be used against the juvenile;
6 (d) Of the right to confront anyone who testifies against the
7 juvenile and to cross-examine any persons who appear against the
8 juvenile;
9 (e) Of the right of the juvenile to testify and to compel other
10 witnesses to attend and testify in his or her own behalf;
11 (f) Of the right of the juvenile to a speedy adjudication hearing;
12 and
13 (g) Of the right to appeal and have a transcript for such purpose.
14 After giving such warnings and admonitions, the court may accept an
15 in-court admission or answer of no contest by the juvenile of all or any
16 part of the allegations in the petition if the court has determined from
17 examination of the juvenile and those present that such admission or
18 answer of no contest is intelligently, voluntarily, and understandingly
19 made and with an affirmative waiver of rights and that a factual basis
20 for such admission or answer of no contest exists. The waiver of the
21 right to counsel shall satisfy section 43-3102. The court may base its
22 adjudication provided in subsection (2) of this section on such admission
23 or answer of no contest.
24 (2) If the juvenile denies the petition or stands mute the court
25 shall first allow a reasonable time for preparation if needed and then
26 consider only the question of whether the juvenile is a person described
27 by section 43-247. After hearing the evidence on such question, the court
28 shall make a finding and adjudication, to be entered on the records of
29 the court, whether or not the juvenile is a person described by
30 subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247 based upon proof
31 beyond a reasonable doubt. If an Indian child is involved, the standard
-10-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 of proof shall be in compliance with the Nebraska Indian Child Welfare
2 Act, if applicable.
3 (3) If the court shall find that the juvenile named in the petition
4 is not within the provisions of section 43-247, it shall dismiss the
5 case. If the court finds that the juvenile named in the petition is such
6 a juvenile, it shall make and enter its findings and adjudication
7 accordingly, designating which subdivision or subdivisions of section
8 43-247 such juvenile is within; the court shall allow a reasonable time
9 for preparation if needed and then proceed to an inquiry into the proper
10 disposition to be made of such juvenile.
11 Sec. 7. Section 43-286, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
12 2024, is amended to read:
13 43-286 (1) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile
14 described in subdivision (1), (2), or (4) of section 43-247:
15 (a) The court may continue the dispositional portion of the hearing,
16 from time to time upon such terms and conditions as the court may
17 prescribe, including an order of restitution of any property stolen or
18 damaged or an order requiring the juvenile to participate in restorative
19 justice programs or community service programs, if such order is in the
20 interest of the juvenile's reformation or rehabilitation, and, subject to
21 the further order of the court, may:
22 (i) Place the juvenile on probation subject to the supervision of a
23 probation officer; or
24 (ii) Permit the juvenile to remain in his or her own home or be
25 placed in a suitable family home or institution, subject to the
26 supervision of the probation officer;
27 (b) When it is alleged that the juvenile has exhausted all levels of
28 probation supervision and options for community-based services and
29 section 43-251.01 has been satisfied, a motion for commitment to a youth
30 rehabilitation and treatment center may be filed and proceedings held as
31 follows:
-11-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 (i) The motion shall set forth specific factual allegations that
2 support the motion and a copy of such motion shall be served on all
3 persons required to be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267;
4 (ii) The Office of Juvenile Services shall be served with a copy of
5 such motion and shall be a party to the case for all matters related to
6 the juvenile's commitment to, placement with, or discharge from the
7 Office of Juvenile Services; and
8 (iii) The juvenile shall be entitled to a hearing before the court
9 to determine the validity of the allegations. At such hearing the burden
10 is upon the state by a preponderance of the evidence to show that:
11 (A) All levels of probation supervision have been exhausted;
12 (B) All options for community-based services have been exhausted;
13 and
14 (C) Placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center is a
15 matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the
16 juvenile or the person or property of another or if it appears that such
17 juvenile is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court;
18 (c) After the hearing, the court may, as a condition of an order of
19 intensive supervised probation, commit such juvenile to the Office of
20 Juvenile Services for placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment
21 center operated in compliance with state law. Upon commitment by the
22 court to the Office of Juvenile Services, the court shall immediately
23 notify the Office of Juvenile Services of the commitment. Intensive
24 supervised probation for purposes of this subdivision means that the
25 Office of Juvenile Services shall be responsible for the care and custody
26 of the juvenile until the Office of Juvenile Services discharges the
27 juvenile from commitment to the Office of Juvenile Services. Upon
28 discharge of the juvenile, the court shall hold a review hearing on the
29 conditions of probation and enter any order allowed under subdivision (1)
30 (a) of this section;
31 (d) The Office of Juvenile Services shall notify those required to
-12-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267, all interested parties, and the
2 committing court of the pending discharge of a juvenile from the youth
3 rehabilitation and treatment center sixty days prior to discharge and
4 again in every case not less than thirty days prior to discharge. Upon
5 notice of pending discharge by the Office of Juvenile Services, the court
6 shall set a continued disposition hearing in anticipation of reentry. The
7 Office of Juvenile Services shall work in collaboration with the Office
8 of Probation Administration in developing an individualized reentry plan
9 for the juvenile as provided in section 43-425. The Office of Juvenile
10 Services shall provide a copy of the individualized reentry plan to the
11 juvenile, the juvenile's attorney, and the county attorney or city
12 attorney prior to the continued disposition hearing. At the continued
13 disposition hearing, the court shall review and approve or modify the
14 individualized reentry plan, place the juvenile under probation
15 supervision, and enter any other order allowed by law. No hearing is
16 required if all interested parties stipulate to the individualized
17 reentry plan by signed motion. In such a case, the court shall approve
18 the conditions of probation, approve the individualized reentry plan, and
19 place the juvenile under probation supervision; and
20 (e) The Office of Juvenile Services is responsible for
21 transportation of the juvenile to and from the youth rehabilitation and
22 treatment center. The Office of Juvenile Services may contract for such
23 services. A plan for a juvenile's transport to return to the community
24 shall be a part of the individualized reentry plan. The Office of
25 Juvenile Services may approve family to provide such transport when
26 specified in the individualized reentry plan.
27 (2) When any juvenile is found by the court to be a juvenile
28 described in subdivision (3)(b) of section 43-247, the court may enter
29 such order as it is empowered to enter under subdivision (1)(a) of this
30 section.
31 (3) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile described in
-13-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section 43-247, the court may
2 order the juvenile to be assessed for referral to participate in a
3 restorative justice program. Factors that the judge may consider for such
4 referral include, but are not limited to: The juvenile's age,
5 intellectual capacity, and living environment; the ages of others who
6 were part of the offense; the age and capacity of the victim; and the
7 nature of the case.
8 (4) When a juvenile is placed on probation and a probation officer
9 has reasonable cause to believe that such juvenile has committed a
10 violation of a condition of his or her probation, the probation officer
11 shall take appropriate measures as provided in section 43-286.01.
12 (5)(a) When a juvenile is placed on probation or under the
13 supervision of the court and it is alleged that the juvenile is again a
14 juvenile described in subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of section
15 43-247, a petition may be filed and the same procedure followed and
16 rights given at a hearing on the original petition. If an adjudication is
17 made that the allegations of the petition are true, the court may make
18 any disposition authorized by this section for such adjudications and the
19 county attorney may file a motion to revoke the juvenile's probation.
20 (b) When a juvenile is placed on probation or under the supervision
21 of the court for conduct under subdivision (1), (2), (3)(b), or (4) of
22 section 43-247 and it is alleged that the juvenile has violated a term of
23 probation or supervision or that the juvenile has violated an order of
24 the court, a motion to revoke probation or supervision or to change the
25 disposition may be filed and proceedings held as follows:
26 (i) The motion shall set forth specific factual allegations of the
27 alleged violations and a copy of such motion shall be served on all
28 persons required to be served by sections 43-262 to 43-267;
29 (ii) The juvenile shall be entitled to a hearing before the court to
30 determine the validity of the allegations. At such hearing the juvenile
31 shall be entitled to those rights relating to counsel provided by section
-14-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 43-272 and those rights relating to detention provided by sections 43-254
2 to 43-256. The juvenile shall also be entitled to speak and present
3 documents, witnesses, or other evidence on his or her own behalf. He or
4 she may confront persons who have given adverse information concerning
5 the alleged violations, may cross-examine such persons, and may show that
6 he or she did not violate the conditions of his or her probation or
7 supervision or an order of the court or, if he or she did, that
8 mitigating circumstances suggest that the violation does not warrant
9 revocation of probation or supervision or a change of disposition. The
10 hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the juvenile is
11 taken into custody;
12 (iii) The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and shall
13 be flexible enough to consider evidence, including letters, affidavits,
14 and other material, that would not be admissible in an adversarial
15 criminal trial;
16 (iv) The juvenile shall not be confined, detained, or otherwise
17 significantly deprived of his or her liberty pursuant to the filing of a
18 motion described in this section unless the requirements of subdivision
19 (5) of section 43-251.01 and section 43-260.01 have been met. In all
20 cases when the requirements of subdivision (5) of section 43-251.01 and
21 section 43-260.01 have been met and the juvenile is confined, detained,
22 or otherwise significantly deprived of his or her liberty as a result of
23 his or her alleged violation of probation, supervision, or a court order,
24 the juvenile shall be given a preliminary hearing. If, as a result of
25 such preliminary hearing, probable cause is found to exist, the juvenile
26 shall be entitled to a hearing before the court in accordance with this
27 subsection;
28 (v) If the juvenile is found by the court to have violated the terms
29 of his or her probation or supervision or an order of the court, the
30 court may modify the terms and conditions of the probation, supervision,
31 or other court order, extend the period of probation, supervision, or
-15-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 other court order, or enter any order of disposition that could have been
2 made at the time the original order was entered; and
3 (vi) In cases when the court revokes probation, supervision, or
4 other court order, it shall enter a written statement as to the evidence
5 relied on and the reasons for revocation.
6 (6)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (6)(b) of this section and
7 section 8 of this act, the court shall not change a disposition unless
8 the court finds that the juvenile has violated a term or condition of
9 probation or supervision or an order of the court and the procedures in
10 subdivision (5)(b) of this section have been satisfied.
11 (b) Upon motion of the juvenile, the court may modify the terms or
12 conditions of probation or supervision or modify a dispositional order
13 if:
14 (i) All parties stipulate to the particular modification; and
15 (ii) The juvenile has consulted with counsel or has waived counsel.
16 Any waiver must be particular to the modification and shall comply with
17 section 43-3102.
18 (7) Costs incurred on behalf of a juvenile under this section shall
19 be paid as provided in section 43-290.01.
20 (8) When any juvenile is adjudicated to be a juvenile described in
21 subdivision (4) of section 43-247, the juvenile court shall within thirty
22 days of adjudication transmit to the Director of Motor Vehicles an
23 abstract of the court record of adjudication.
24 Sec. 8. (1) At any time after the disposition of a juvenile
25 described in subdivision (1)(a)(iii) of section 29-1816, the county
26 attorney may file a motion requesting the juvenile court to dismiss the
27 petition and authorize the county attorney to refile any charges
28 described in such subdivision as a criminal proceeding in district court.
29 (2)(a) The juvenile court shall schedule a hearing on such motion
30 within fifteen days after the motion is filed.
31 (b) The juvenile shall be represented by counsel at the hearing and
-16-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 may present the evidence as to why the proceeding should be retained.
2 (c) After considering all the evidence and reasons presented by both
3 parties, the juvenile court shall retain the proceeding unless the court
4 determines that the county attorney has shown, by a preponderance of the
5 evidence, that the juvenile is not amenable to rehabilitation under the
6 Nebraska Juvenile Code and that a criminal proceeding would be more
7 appropriate.
8 (d) The juvenile court shall make a decision on the motion within
9 thirty days after the hearing. The juvenile court shall set forth
10 findings for the reason for its decision.
11 (3) An order granting or denying a motion under this section shall
12 be considered a final order for the purposes of appeal. Upon the entry of
13 an order, any party may appeal to the Court of Appeals within ten days.
14 Such review shall be advanced on the court docket without an extension of
15 time granted to any party except upon a showing of exceptional cause.
16 Appeals shall be submitted, assigned, and scheduled for oral argument as
17 soon as the appellee's brief is due to be filed. The Court of Appeals
18 shall conduct its review in an expedited manner and shall render the
19 judgment and opinion, if any, as speedily as possible. During the
20 pendency of any such appeal, the juvenile court may continue to enter
21 temporary orders in the best interests of the juvenile pursuant to
22 section 43-295.
23 (4) If the motion is granted, the county attorney or city attorney
24 shall file a criminal information in the district court and the juvenile
25 shall be arraigned as provided for a person eighteen years of age or
26 older in subdivision (1)(b) of section 29-1816.
27 (5) If a motion under this section is granted, any statute of
28 limitations for an offense described in subdivision (1)(a)(iii) of
29 section 29-1816, including a statute of limitations which would otherwise
30 have expired, shall be extended until the later of:
31 (a) One year after the date the motion to transfer is granted; or
-17-

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 (b) One year after entry of final judgment in an appeal concerning
2 the motion to transfer.
3 (6) An order under this section shall be considered by the county
4 attorney in making a future determination under section 43-276 regarding
5 such juvenile and by the court when considering a future transfer motion
6 under section 29-1816 or 43-274 or this section or any future charge or
7 petition regarding such juvenile.
8 (7)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (7)(b) of this section, any
9 admission, confession, or statement made by the juvenile in a proceeding
10 under this section shall be inadmissible in any criminal or civil
11 proceeding.
12 (b) This subsection does not prevent any such admission, confession,
13 or statement from being:
14 (i) Admissible in proceedings relating to the motion under this
15 section;
16 (ii) Admissible in any subsequent proceedings for such juvenile
17 under the Nebraska Juvenile Code if the case is not transferred to
18 district court;

29 motion of any party or the court on its own motion, a hearing may be held
30 regarding the amenability of the juvenile to the rehabilitative services
31 that can be provided under the Nebraska Juvenile Code. The court may

LB407 LB407
2025 2025
1 enter an order, based upon evidence presented at the hearing, finding
2 that a juvenile is not amenable to rehabilitative services that can be
