5 (3) Any bonding and insurance required by law or as may be
6 additionally required by the division;

8 division in its selection of the construction manager, including a
9 project statement which contains information about the scope and nature
10 of the project, the project site, the schedule, and the estimated budget;
11 (5) The criteria for evaluation of proposals and the relative weight
12 of each criterion;
13 (6) A statement that the construction manager shall not be allowed
14 to sublet, assign, or otherwise dispose of any portion of the contract
15 without consent of the division. In no case shall the division allow the
16 construction manager to sublet more than seventy percent of the work,

23 expiration of the time established for making the proposals as set forth
24 in the request for proposals.
25 (3) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time prior to signing a

27 to reject any and all proposals at no cost to the division. The division
28 may thereafter solicit new proposals or may cancel the construction
29 manager-general contractor procurement process.
30 (4) The division shall rank the construction managers in accordance
31 with the qualification-based selection process and pursuant to the
-11-

LB445 LB445
2025 2025
1 criteria in the request for proposals. The division may meet with
2 construction managers prior to the ranking.
3 (5) The division may attempt to negotiate a contract for
4 preconstruction services with the highest ranked construction manager and
5 may enter into a contract for preconstruction services after
6 negotiations. If the division is unable to negotiate a satisfactory
7 contract for preconstruction services with the highest ranked
8 construction manager, the division may terminate negotiations with that
9 construction manager. The division may then undertake negotiations with
10 the second highest ranked construction manager and may enter into a
11 contract for preconstruction services after negotiations. If the division
12 is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the second highest
13 ranked construction manager, the division may undertake negotiations with
14 the third highest ranked construction manager, if any, and may enter into
15 a contract for preconstruction services after negotiations.
16 (6) If the division is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract
17 for preconstruction services with any of the ranked construction
18 managers, the division may either revise the request for proposals and
19 solicit new proposals or cancel the construction manager-general
20 contractor contract process under the State Building Construction
21 Alternatives Act.
22 Sec. 16. (1) Before the construction manager begins any
23 construction services, the division shall:
24 (a) Conduct an independent cost estimate for the project; and

29 negotiate a contract, the division may use other contract procurement
30 processes as provided by law. Persons or organizations who submitted
31 proposals but were unable to negotiate a contract with the division shall
-12-

LB445 LB445
2025 2025
1 be eligible to compete in the other contract procurement processes.
2 Sec. 17. A design-build contract and a construction manager-general
3 contractor contract may be conditioned upon later refinements in scope
4 and price and may permit the division in agreement with the design-
5 builder or construction manager to make changes in the project without
6 invalidating the contract.
7 Sec. 18. Nothing in the State Building Construction Alternatives
8 Act shall limit or reduce statutory or regulatory requirements regarding
9 insurance.

12 Act.
13 Sec. 20. Section 72-803, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
14 amended to read:
15 72-803 (1) The state and any department or agency thereof, subject
16 to the powers of the state building division of the Department of
17 Administrative Services, shall have general charge of the erection of new
18 buildings which are being erected for such department or agency, the
19 repair and improvement of buildings under the control of such department

21 the control of such department or agency.
22 (2) Buildings and other improvements costing more than seventy-five
23 fifty thousand dollars shall be (a) constructed under the general charge
24 of the department or agency as provided in subsection (1) of this section
25 and (b) let by contract to the lowest responsible bidder after proper
26 advertisement as set forth in subsection (4) of this section. The
27 Department of Administrative Services shall adjust the dollar amounts in
28 this subsection every four years beginning January 1, 2026, to account
29 for inflationary and market changes. The department shall select a
30 construction cost index or any other published index relevant to
31 operations and utilities costs and shall base the adjustments on the
-13-

LB445 LB445
2025 2025
1 percentage changes in such index.
2 (3) The successful bidder at the letting shall enter into a contract
3 with the department or agency, prepared as provided for by subsection (4)
4 of this section, and shall furnish a bond for the faithful performance of
5 his or her contract, except that a performance bond shall not be required
6 for any project which has a total cost of one hundred thousand dollars or
7 less unless the department or agency includes a bond requirement in the
8 specifications for the project.
9 (4) When contracts are to be let by the department or agency as
10 provided in subsection (2) of this section, advertisements shall be
11 published in accordance with rules and regulations adopted and
12 promulgated by the state building division stating that sealed proposals
13 will be received by the department or agency at its office on the date
14 therein stated for the furnishing of materials, the construction of
15 buildings, or the making of repairs or improvements and that plans and
16 specifications can be seen at the office of the department or agency. All
17 bids or proposals shall be accompanied by a certified check or by a bid
18 bond in a sum fixed by the department or agency and payable thereto. All
19 such contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, but the
20 right shall be reserved to reject any and all bids. Whenever any material
21 described in any contract can be obtained from any state institution, the
22 department or agency shall exclude it from such a contract.
