1 the property tax credit provided in this section to the extent of any
2 remaining liability after calculation of the homestead exemption. If the
3 property tax credit provided in this section results in a property tax

5 credit which cannot be used by the taxpayer shall be returned to the
6 Property Tax Administrator by July 1 of the year the amount disbursed to
7 the county was disbursed. The Property Tax Administrator shall
8 immediately credit any funds returned under this subsection to the School

10 under this subsection, the county treasurer shall electronically file a

13 school district in the county in the year the funds were returned and the

18 in the prior year on all real property in the county to the school
19 district taxes levied in the prior year on all real property in the
20 state. By September 15, 2024, and by September 15 of each year

28 property taxes owed to school districts, in the same manner as if such
29 funds had been received in the form of property tax payments for property
30 taxes owed to school districts, meaning any amounts attributable to
31 divided taxes pursuant to section 18-2147 of the Community Development
