ONE HUNDRED NINTH LEGISLATURE
FIRST SESSION
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION 86
Introduced by Rountree, 3.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this resolution is to propose an interim study to
identify and examine the state of affordable and accessible housing in Nebraska
and what public policies or resources are needed so that Nebraskans with
disabilities can actualize the right to community living set forth in Olmstead
v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The United States Supreme Court's decision in
Olmstead affirmed the right of people with disabilities, when appropriate and
desired, to live in the community and not kept isolated in institutions. Access
to affordable, decent, safe, integrated, and accessible housing is critical.
The Legislature recognized the importance of its obligations set forth in the
Olmstead decision and created statutory authority under section 81-6,122 to
form an Olmstead Committee to develop a plan to meet Nebraska's Olmstead
commitments.
The interim study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) The nature, characteristics, and importance of accessibility as it
relates to housing;
(2) The current stock of affordable housing and the extent to which this
stock is accessible for people with disabilities;
(3) Existing affordable housing programs and resources in Nebraska,
including programs and resources to assist with home modifications designed to
increase accessibility for people with disabilities;
(4) Prospective programs, policies, and resources that could be utilized
or leveraged to increase accessible and affordable housing for people with
disabilities;
(5) A comparison of costs for people with disabilities to live in
institutional settings and costs to live within their community, including home

modification costs and the provision of community-based services; and
(6) The long-term effects and costs when an individual is injured in such
individual's home.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH
LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA, FIRST SESSION:
1. That the Urban Affairs Committee of the Legislature shall be designated
to conduct an interim study to carry out the purposes of this resolution.
2. That the committee shall upon the conclusion of its study make a report
of its findings, together with its recommendations, to the Legislative Council
or Legislature.
