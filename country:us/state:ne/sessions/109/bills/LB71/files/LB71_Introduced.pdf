1 Section 1. Section 43-536, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
2 2024, is amended to read:
3 43-536 In determining the rate of reimbursement for child care, the
4 Department of Health and Human Services shall assess the market rates and
5 costs for provision of services of the child care providers in the state,
6 utilizing an approved methodology in accordance with 45 C.F.R. 98.45, as
7 such section existed on January 1, 2024. The department shall adjust the
8 reimbursement rate for child care every odd-numbered year at a rate not
9 less than the seventy-fifth percentile of the current market rate, except
10 that (1) nationally accredited child care providers may be reimbursed at
11 higher rates and (2) an applicable child care or early childhood
12 education program, as defined in section 71-1954, that is participating
13 in the quality rating and improvement system and has received a rating of
14 step two three or higher under the Step Up to Quality Child Care Act may
15 be reimbursed at higher rates based upon the program's quality scale
16 rating under the quality rating and improvement system.
17 Sec. 2. Section 68-1206, Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement,
18 2024, is amended to read:
19 68-1206 (1) The Department of Health and Human Services shall
20 administer the program of social services in this state. The department
21 may contract with other social agencies for the purchase of social
22 services at rates not to exceed those prevailing in the state or the cost
23 at which the department could provide those services. The statutory
24 maximum payments for the separate program of aid to dependent children
25 shall apply only to public assistance grants and shall not apply to
26 payments for social services.
27 (2)(a) As part of the provision of social services authorized by
28 section 68-1202, the department shall participate in the federal child
29 care assistance program under 42 U.S.C. 9857 et seq., as such sections
30 existed on January 1, 2023, and provide child care assistance to families
31 with incomes up to (i) one hundred eighty-five percent of the federal
-2-

LB71 LB71
2025 2025
1 poverty level prior to October 1, 2026, or (ii) one hundred thirty
2 percent of the federal poverty level on and after October 1, 2026.
3 (b)(i) As part of the provision of social services authorized by
4 this section and section 68-1202, the department shall participate in the
5 federal Child Care Subsidy program. A child care provider seeking to
6 participate in the federal Child Care Subsidy program shall comply with
7 the criminal history record information check requirements of the Child
8 Care Licensing Act. In determining ongoing eligibility for this program,
9 ten percent of a household's gross earned income shall be disregarded
10 after twelve continuous months on the program and at each subsequent
11 redetermination. In determining ongoing eligibility, if a family's income
12 exceeds one hundred eighty-five percent of the federal poverty level
13 prior to October 1, 2026, or one hundred thirty percent of the federal
14 poverty level on and after October 1, 2026, the family shall receive
15 transitional child care assistance through the remainder of the family's
16 eligibility period or until the family's income exceeds eighty-five
17 percent of the state median income for a family of the same size as
18 reported by the United States Bureau of the Census, whichever occurs
19 first. When the family's eligibility period ends, the family shall
20 continue to be eligible for transitional child care assistance if the
21 family's income is below two hundred percent of the federal poverty level
22 prior to October 1, 2026, or one hundred eighty-five percent of the
23 federal poverty level on and after October 1, 2026. The family shall
24 receive transitional child care assistance through the remainder of the
25 transitional eligibility period or until the family's income exceeds
26 eighty-five percent of the state median income for a family of the same
27 size as reported by the United States Bureau of the Census, whichever
28 occurs first. The amount of such child care assistance shall be based on
29 a cost-shared plan between the recipient family and the state and shall
30 be based on a sliding-scale methodology. A recipient family may be
31 required to contribute a percentage of such family's gross income for
-3-

2025 2025
1 child care that is no more than the cost-sharing rates in the
2 transitional child care assistance program as of January 1, 2015, for
3 those no longer eligible for cash assistance as provided in section
4 68-1724.
5 (ii) A licensed child care program that employs a member of an
6 eligible household shall make reasonable accommodations so that the
7 eligible applicant or adult household member is not a primary caregiver
8 to such applicant's or adult household member's child. If reasonable
9 accommodation cannot be made, the department shall allow the applicant or
10 adult household member to receive child care assistance for the
11 applicant's or adult household member's child including when the
12 applicant or adult household member is the primary caregiver for such
13 child.
14 (iii) A licensed child care provider eligible for the child care
15 subsidy may enroll the household member's child in a child care program
16 other than the household member's child care program to receive child
17 care assistance.
18 (iv) Subdivisions (2)(b)(ii) and (2)(b)(iii) of this section shall
19 become operative on July 1, 2025. The department shall promulgate rules
20 and regulations consistent with these subdivisions.
21 (c) For the period beginning July 1, 2021, through September 30,
22 2026, funds provided to the State of Nebraska pursuant to the Child Care
23 and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 9857 et seq., as such
24 act and sections existed on January 1, 2023, shall be used to pay the
25 costs to the state resulting from the income eligibility changes made in
26 subdivisions (2)(a) and (b) of this section by Laws 2021, LB485. If the
27 available amount of such funds is insufficient to pay such costs, then
28 funds provided to the state for the Temporary Assistance for Needy
29 Families program established in 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq. may also be used.
30 No General Funds shall be used to pay the costs to the state, other than
31 administration costs, resulting from the income eligibility changes made

2 the period beginning July 1, 2021, through September 30, 2026.
3 (d) The Department of Health and Human Services shall collaborate
4 with a private nonprofit organization with expertise in early childhood
5 care and education for an independent evaluation of the income
6 eligibility changes made in subdivisions (2)(a) and (b) of this section
7 by Laws 2021, LB485, if private funding is made available for such
8 purpose. The evaluation shall be completed by July 1, 2024, and shall be
9 submitted electronically to the department and to the Health and Human
10 Services Committee of the Legislature.
11 (3) In determining the rate or rates to be paid by the department
12 for child care as defined in section 43-2605, the department shall adopt
13 a fixed-rate schedule for the state or a fixed-rate schedule for an area
14 of the state applicable to each child care program category of provider
15 as defined in section 71-1910 which may claim reimbursement for services
16 provided by the federal Child Care Subsidy program, except that the
17 department shall not pay a rate higher than that charged by an individual
18 provider to that provider's private clients. The schedule may provide
19 separate rates for care for infants, for children with special needs,
20 including disabilities or technological dependence, or for other
21 individual categories of children. The schedule may also provide tiered
22 rates based upon a quality scale rating of step two three or higher under
23 the Step Up to Quality Child Care Act. The schedule shall be effective on
24 October 1 of every year and shall be revised annually by the department.
25 Sec. 3. Section 71-1961, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, is
26 amended to read:
27 71-1961 Quality rating and improvement system incentives and support
28 under the Step Up to Quality Child Care Act shall include, but not be
29 limited to:
30 (1) Tiered child care subsidy reimbursements as provided in section

8 (3) Professional development, training, and scholarships developed

13 respectful of diversity of families and children with special needs; and
14 (5) Other incentives as necessary to carry out the Step Up to
15 Quality Child Care Act.
16 Sec. 4. Original section 71-1961, Reissue Revised Statutes of
